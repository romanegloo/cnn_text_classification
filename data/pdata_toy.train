2 Effects of supervised exercise therapy in patients receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer. Postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer has a number of associated complications. This study examined whether supervised moderate-intensity exercise could mitigate the complications that occur during radiotherapy. Forty women were randomized before radiotherapy after various operations for breast cancer. Seventeen patients who were assigned to the exercise group performed supervised moderate-intensity exercise therapy for 50 min 3 times per week for 5 weeks. Twenty-three patients in the control group were asked to perform self-shoulder stretching exercise. The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), brief fatigue inventory (BFI), range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder, and pain score were assessed before and after radiotherapy. There were no significant differences noted at baseline between groups. In the exercise group, there was an increase in the WHOQOL-BREF and shoulder ROM and decrease in BFI and pain score after radiotherapy. On the other hand, patients in the control group showed decrease in the WHOQOL-BREF and shoulder ROM and increase in BFI and pain score after radiotherapy. There were statistically significant differences in the changes in the WHOQOL, BFI, shoulder ROM, and pain score between the groups. Patients receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer may benefit in physical and psychological aspects from supervised moderate-intensity exercise therapy.
2 Two host factors regulate persistence of H7-specific T cells injected in tumor-bearing mice. Injection of CD8 T cells primed against immunodominant minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) such as H7(a) can eradicate leukemia and solid tumors. To understand why MiHA-targeted T cells have such a potent antitumor effect it is essential to evaluate their in vivo behavior. In the present work, we therefore addressed two specific questions: what is the proliferative dynamics of H7(a)-specifc T cells in tumors, and do H7(a)-specific T cells persist long-term after adoptive transfer? By day 3 after adoptive transfer, we observed a selective infiltration of melanomas by anti-H7(a) T cells. Over the next five days, anti-H7(a) T cells expanded massively in the tumor but not in the spleen. Thus, by day 8 after injection, anti-H7(a) T cells in the tumor had undergone more cell divisions than those in the spleen. These data strongly suggest that anti-H7(a) T cells proliferate preferentially and extensively in the tumors. We also found that two host factors regulated long-term persistence of anti-H7(a) memory T cells: thymic function and expression of H7(a) by host cells. On day 100, anti-H7(a) memory T cells were abundant in euthymic H7(a)-negative (B10.H7(b)) mice, present in low numbers in thymectomized H7(a)-positive (B10) hosts, and undetectable in euthymic H7(a)-positive recipients. Although in general the tumor environment is not propitious to T-cell invasion and expansion, the present work shows that this limitation may be overcome by adoptive transfer of primed CD8 T cells targeted to an immunodominant MiHA (here H7(a)). At least in some cases, prolonged persistence of adoptively transferred T cells may be valuable for prevention of late cancer relapse in adoptive hosts. Our findings therefore suggest that it may be advantageous to target MiHAs with a restricted tissue distribution in order to promote persistence of memory T cells and thereby minimize the risk of cancer recurrence.
2 Rates and determinants of uptake and use of an internet physical activity and weight management program in office and manufacturing work sites in England: cohort study. Internet-based physical activity (PA) and weight management programs have the potential to improve employees' health in large occupational health settings. To be successful, the program must engage a wide range of employees, especially those at risk of weight gain or ill health. The aim of the study was to assess the use and nonuse (user attrition) of a Web-based and monitoring device-based PA and weight management program in a range of employees and to determine if engagement with the program was related to the employees' baseline characteristics or measured outcomes. Longitudinal observational study of a cohort of employees having access to the MiLife Web-based automated behavior change system. Employees were recruited from manufacturing and office sites in the North West and the South of England. Baseline health data were collected, and participants were given devices to monitor their weight and PA via data upload to the website. Website use, PA, and weight data were collected throughout the 12-week program. Overall, 12% of employees at the four sites (265/2302) agreed to participate in the program, with 130 men (49%) and 135 women (51%), and of these, 233 went on to start the program. During the program, the dropout rate was 5% (11/233). Of the remaining 222 Web program users, 173 (78%) were using the program at the end of the 12 weeks, with 69% (153/222) continuing after this period. Engagement with the program varied by site but was not significantly different between the office and factory sites. During the first 2 weeks, participants used the website, on average, 6 times per week, suggesting an initial learning period after which the frequency of website log-in was typically 2 visits per week and 7 minutes per visit. Employees who uploaded weight data had a significant reduction in weight (-2.6 kg, SD 3.2, P< .001). The reduction in weight was largest for employees using the program's weight loss mode (-3.4 kg, SD 3.5). Mean PA level recorded throughout the program was 173 minutes (SE 12.8) of moderate/high intensity PA per week. Website interaction time was higher and attrition rates were lower (OR 1.38, P= .03) in those individuals with the greatest weight loss. This Web-based PA and weight management program showed high levels of engagement across a wide range of employees, including overweight or obese workers, shift workers, and those who do not work with computers. Weight loss was observed at both office and manufacturing sites. The use of monitoring devices to capture and send data to the automated Web-based coaching program may have influenced the high levels of engagement observed in this study. When combined with objective monitoring devices for PA and weight, both use of the website and outcomes can be tracked, allowing the online coaching program to become more personalized to the individual.
0 Carcinoma mixed within milk of calcium in a breast: a case report. Milk of calcium located in the breast is typically a benign entity. However, carcinoma may incidentally arise adjacent to or even within milk of calcium. Consequently, the characteristics of all observed calcific particles should be carefully analyzed. In this study, we report a case of carcinoma presented as malignant microcalcifications mixed within milk of calcium in a breast.
3 Identification of the human eosinophil lineage-committed progenitor: revision of phenotypic definition of the human common myeloid progenitor. To establish effective therapeutic strategies for eosinophil-related disorders, it is critical to understand the developmental pathway of human eosinophils. In mouse hematopoiesis, eosinophils originate from the eosinophil lineage-committed progenitor (EoP) that has been purified downstream of the granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP). We show that the EoP is also isolatable in human adult bone marrow. The previously defined human common myeloid progenitor (hCMP) population (Manz, M.G., T. Miyamoto, K. Akashi, and I.L. Weissman. 2002. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 99:11872-11877) was composed of the interleukin 5 receptor alpha chain(+) (IL-5Ralpha(+)) and IL-5Ralpha(-) fractions, and the former was the hEoP. The IL-5Ralpha(+)CD34(+)CD38(+)IL-3Ralpha(+)CD45RA(-) hEoPs gave rise exclusively to pure eosinophil colonies but never differentiated into basophils or neutrophils. The IL-5Ralpha(-) hCMP generated the hEoP together with the hGMP or the human megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitor (hMEP), whereas hGMPs or hMEPs never differentiated into eosinophils. Importantly, the number of hEoPs increased up to 20% of the conventional hCMP population in the bone marrow of patients with eosinophilia, suggesting that the hEoP stage is involved in eosinophil differentiation and expansion in vivo. Accordingly, the phenotypic definition of hCMP should be revised to exclude the hEoP; an "IL-5Ralpha-negative" criterion should be added to define more homogenous hCMP. The newly identified hEoP is a powerful tool in studying pathogenesis of eosinophilia and could be a therapeutic target for a variety of eosinophil-related disorders.
3 Toll-like receptors and cytokines as surrogate biomarkers for evaluating vaginal immune response following microbicide administration. Topical microbicides are intended for frequent use by women in reproductive age. Hence, it is essential to evaluate their impact on mucosal immune function in the vagina. In the present study, we evaluated nisin, a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide (AMP), for its efficacy as an intravaginal microbicide. Its effect on the vaginal immune function was determined by localizing Toll-like receptors (TLRs-3, 9) and cytokines (IL-4, 6 , 10 and TNF-alpha) in the rabbit cervicovaginal epithelium following intravaginal administration of high dose of nisin gel for 14 consecutive days. The results revealed no alteration in the expression of TLRs and cytokines at both protein and mRNA levels. However, in SDS gel-treated group, the levels were significantly upregulated with the induction of NF-kappaB signalling cascade. Thus, TLRs and cytokines appear as sensitive indicators for screening immunotoxic potential of candidate microbicides.
0 The genome sequence of Caenorhabditis briggsae: a platform for comparative genomics. The soil nematodes Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans diverged from a common ancestor roughly 100 million years ago and yet are almost indistinguishable by eye. They have the same chromosome number and genome sizes, and they occupy the same ecological niche. To explore the basis for this striking conservation of structure and function, we have sequenced the C. briggsae genome to a high-quality draft stage and compared it to the finished C. elegans sequence. We predict approximately 19,500 protein-coding genes in the C. briggsae genome, roughly the same as in C. elegans. Of these, 12,200 have clear C. elegans orthologs, a further 6,500 have one or more clearly detectable C. elegans homologs, and approximately 800 C. briggsae genes have no detectable matches in C. elegans. Almost all of the noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two species. The two genomes exhibit extensive colinearity, and the rate of divergence appears to be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the centers. Operons, a distinctive feature of C. elegans, are highly conserved in C. briggsae, with the arrangement of genes being preserved in 96% of cases. The difference in size between the C. briggsae (estimated at approximately 104 Mbp) and C. elegans (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost entirely due to repetitive sequence, which accounts for 22.4% of the C. briggsae genome in contrast to 16.5% of the C. elegans genome. Few, if any, repeat families are shared, suggesting that most were acquired after the two species diverged or are undergoing rapid evolution. Coclustering the C. elegans and C. briggsae proteins reveals 2,169 protein families of two or more members. Most of these are shared between the two species, but some appear to be expanding or contracting, and there seem to be as many as several hundred novel C. briggsae gene families. The C. briggsae draft sequence will greatly improve the annotation of the C. elegans genome. Based on similarity to C. briggsae, we found strong evidence for 1,300 new C. elegans genes. In addition, comparisons of the two genomes will help to understand the evolutionary forces that mold nematode genomes.
3 The inhibition of assembly of HIV-1 virus-like particles by 3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl) betulinic acid (DSB) is counteracted by Vif and requires its Zinc-binding domain. DSB, the 3-O-(3',3'dimethylsuccinyl) derivative of betulinic acid, blocks the last step of protease-mediated processing of HIV-1 Gag precursor (Pr55Gag), which leads to immature, noninfectious virions. When administered to Pr55Gag-expressing insect cells (Sf9), DSB inhibits the assembly and budding of membrane-enveloped virus-like particles (VLP). In order to explore the possibility that viral factors could modulate the susceptibility to DSB of the VLP assembly process, several viral proteins were coexpressed individually with Pr55Gag in DSB-treated cells, and VLP yields assayed in the extracellular medium. Wild-type Vif (Vifwt) restored the VLP production in DSB-treated cells to levels observed in control, untreated cells. DSB-counteracting effect was also observed with Vif mutants defective in encapsidation into VLP, suggesting that packaging and anti-DSB effect were separate functions in Vif. The anti-DSB effect was abolished for VifC133S and VifS116V, two mutants which lacked the zinc binding domain (ZBD) formed by the four H(108)C(114)C(133)H(139) coordinates with a Zn atom. Electron microscopic analysis of cells coexpressing Pr55Gag and Vifwt showed that a large proportion of VLP budded into cytoplasmic vesicles and were released from Sf9 cells by exocytosis. However, in the presence of mutant VifC133S or VifS116V, most of the VLP assembled and budded at the plasma membrane, as in control cells expressing Pr55Gag alone. The function of HIV-1 Vif protein which negated the DSB inhibition of VLP assembly was independent of its packaging capability, but depended on the integrity of ZBD. In the presence of Vifwt, but not with ZBD mutants VifC133S and VifS116V, VLP were redirected to a vesicular compartment and egressed via the exocytic pathway.
3 Generating carbon finance through avoided deforestation and its potential to create climatic, conservation and human development benefits. Recent proposals to compensate developing countries for reducing emissions from deforestation (RED) under forthcoming climate change mitigation regimes are receiving increasing attention. Here we demonstrate that if RED credits were traded on international carbon markets, even moderate decreases in deforestation rates could generate billions of Euros annually for tropical forest conservation. We also discuss the main challenges for a RED mechanism that delivers real climatic benefits. These include providing sufficient incentives while only rewarding deforestation reductions beyond business-as-usual scenarios, addressing risks arising from forest degradation and international leakage, and ensuring permanence of emission reductions. Governance may become a formidable challenge for RED because some countries with the highest RED potentials score poorly on governance indices. In addition to climate mitigation, RED funds could help achieve substantial co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and human development. However, this will probably require targeted additional support because the highest biodiversity threats and human development needs may exist in countries that have limited income potentials from RED. In conclusion, how successfully a market-based RED mechanism can contribute to climate change mitigation, conservation and development will strongly depend on accompanying measures and carefully designed incentive structures involving governments, business, as well as the conservation and development communities.
2 Aspergillus spondylitis involving the cervico-thoraco-lumbar spine in an immunocompromised patient: a case report. Aspergillosis is a rare cause of spondylitis. Moreover, early diagnosis by MR imaging and adequate treatment can prevent the serious complications of fungal infection. To our knowledge, the MR findings of multilevel aspergillus spondylitis in the cervico-thoraco-lumbar spine have not been previously described. Here, we report the MR findings of aspergillus spondylitis involving the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine in a liver transplant recipient.
2 Impact of associated injuries in the floating knee: a retrospective study. Floating knee injuries are usually associated with other significant injuries. Do these injuries have implications on the management of the floating knee and the final outcome of patients? Our study aims to assess the implications of associated injuries in the management and final outcome of floating knee. 29 patients with floating knees were assessed in our institution. A retrospective analysis of medical records and radiographs were done and all associated injuries were identified. The impact of associated injuries on delay in initial surgical management, delay in rehabilitation & final outcome of the floating knee were assessed. 38 associated injuries were noted. 7 were associated with ipsilateral knee injuries. Lower limb injuries were most commonly associated with the floating knee. Patients with some associated injuries had a delay in surgical management and others a delay in post-operative rehabilitation. Knee ligament and vascular injuries were associated with poor outcome. The associated injuries were quite frequent with the floating knee. Some of the associated injuries caused a delay in surgical management and post-operative rehabilitation. In assessment of the final outcome, patients with associated knee and vascular injuries had a poor prognosis. Majority of the patients with associated injuries had a good or excellent outcome.
1 Quantitative analysis of peripheral tissue perfusion using spatiotemporal molecular dynamics. Accurate measurement of peripheral tissue perfusion is challenging but necessary to diagnose peripheral vascular insufficiency. Because near infrared (NIR) radiation can penetrate relatively deep into tissue, significant attention has been given to intravital NIR fluorescence imaging. We developed a new optical imaging-based strategy for quantitative measurement of peripheral tissue perfusion by time-series analysis of local pharmacokinetics of the NIR fluorophore, indocyanine green (ICG). Time-series NIR fluorescence images were obtained after injecting ICG intravenously in a murine hindlimb ischemia model. Mathematical modeling and computational simulations were used for translating time-series ICG images into quantitative pixel perfusion rates and a perfusion map. We could successfully predict the prognosis of ischemic hindlimbs based on the perfusion profiles obtained immediately after surgery, which were dependent on the preexisting collaterals. This method also reflected increases in perfusion and improvements in prognosis of ischemic hindlimbs induced by treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor and COMP-angiopoietin-1. We propose that this novel NIR-imaging-based strategy is a powerful tool for biomedical studies related to the evaluation of therapeutic interventions directed at stimulating angiogenesis.
1 GeneTrailExpress: a web-based pipeline for the statistical evaluation of microarray experiments. High-throughput methods that allow for measuring the expression of thousands of genes or proteins simultaneously have opened new avenues for studying biochemical processes. While the noisiness of the data necessitates an extensive pre-processing of the raw data, the high dimensionality requires effective statistical analysis methods that facilitate the identification of crucial biological features and relations. For these reasons, the evaluation and interpretation of expression data is a complex, labor-intensive multi-step process. While a variety of tools for normalizing, analysing, or visualizing expression profiles has been developed in the last years, most of these tools offer only functionality for accomplishing certain steps of the evaluation pipeline. Here, we present a web-based toolbox that provides rich functionality for all steps of the evaluation pipeline. Our tool GeneTrailExpress offers besides standard normalization procedures powerful statistical analysis methods for studying a large variety of biological categories and pathways. Furthermore, an integrated graph visualization tool, BiNA, enables the user to draw the relevant biological pathways applying cutting-edge graph-layout algorithms. Our gene expression toolbox with its interactive visualization of the pathways and the expression values projected onto the nodes will simplify the analysis and interpretation of biochemical pathways considerably.

3 A prospective, multicenter, open-label trial of zoledronic acid in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. The short-term safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid for the treatment of skeletal metastasis was evaluated in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. A total of 19 hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases were enrolled. All patients received up to six infusions of zoledronic acid (4 mg, given intravenously over 15 minutes, every 3-4 weeks). Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events and serum creatinine levels. Efficacy was assessed by monitoring skeletal-related events, brief pain inventory score, quality of life score, type of pain medication, and analgesic score. Mean age of patients was 67.3 years (46-86 years), mean time from diagnosis of bone metastases was 27.6 months (0-117 months), and mean time from diagnosis of hormone-refractory disease was 7.5 months (0-26 months). There was no clinically significant change in serum creatinine levels. Eleven adverse events (musculoskeletal disorders and systemic disorders) in 8 patients were classed as having a possible relationship to study drug. Fifteen patients completed six courses of zoledronic acid infusion. There were no significant changes in the brief pain inventory composite scores, quality of life questionnaire scores or analgesic score. No new skeletal-related events developed during the treatment period. Zoledronic acid administered in this study as a 15-minute infusion demonstrated an acceptable and well-known safety profile in patients with refractory prostate cancer with bone metastases. However, prospective placebo- controlled clinical trials are required to elucidate the efficacy of zoledronic acid.
2 Interventions to prevent disability in frail community-dwelling elderly: a systematic review. There is an interest for intervention studies aiming at the prevention of disability in community-dwelling physically frail older persons, though an overview on their content, methodological quality and effectiveness is lacking. A search for clinical trials involved databases PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and manually hand searching. Trials that included community-dwelling frail older persons based on physical frailty indicators and used disability measures for outcome evaluation were included. The selection of papers and data-extraction was performed by two independent reviewers. Out of 4602 titles, 10 papers remained that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 9 were of sufficient methodological quality and concerned 2 nutritional interventions and 8 physical exercise interventions. No evidence was found for the effect of nutritional interventions on disability measures. The physical exercise interventions involved 2 single-component programs focusing on lower extremity strength and 6 multi-component programs addressing a variety of physical parameters. Out of 8 physical exercise interventions, three reported positive outcomes for disability. There was no evidence for the effect of single lower extremity strength training on disability. Differences between the multi-component interventions in e.g. individualization, duration, intensity and setting hamper the interpretation of the elements that consistently produced successful outcomes. There is an indication that relatively long-lasting and high-intensive multicomponent exercise programs have a positive effect on ADL and IADL disability for community-living moderate physically frail older persons. Future research into disability prevention in physical frail older persons could be directed to more individualized and comprehensive programs.
3 Gender-specific association between polymorphism of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF 936C>T) gene and patients with stomach cancer. Angiogenesis plays an important role in the growth, progression, and metastasis of tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) overexpression has been associated with advanced stage and poor survival in several cancers. We investigated the present case-control study to determine whether there is an association between the VEGF 936C>T polymorphism and stomach cancer. The association of functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VEGF gene with stomach cancer development was evaluated in a case-control study of 154 Korean stomach cancer patients. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Our results revealed significant association of T allele-bearing genotypes with increased risk for stomach cancer development. Genotype frequencies of the VEGF 936C>T polymorphisms were significantly different between patient and control groups (CT, AOR: 2.007, 95% CI: 1.277-3.156, TT, AOR: 4.790, 95% CI: 1.174-19.539, CT+TT, AOR: 2.147, 95% CI: 1.382-3.337). When stratified by gender and age, genotype frequencies were significantly different for stomach cancer in women and in patients younger than 55 years (in women, CT, OR: 3.049, 95% CI: 1.568-5.930, CT+TT, OR: 3.132, 95% CI: 1.638-5.990; in < 55 years, CT, OR: 3.306, 95% CI: 1.413-7.732, CT+TT, OR: 3.967, 95% CI: 1.729-9.104). In addition, this association partially remained in cases with intestinal and diffuse-type stomach cancer. Our present study suggests that the VEGF 936C>T polymorphism is a susceptibility factor for stomach cancer, at least in Korean. These observations, however, require further confirmation by a larger multi-ethnic study.
0 Molecular phylogenetics reveal multiple tertiary vicariance origins of the African rain forest trees. Tropical rain forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems on the planet. How this diversity evolved remains largely unexplained. In Africa, rain forests are situated in two geographically isolated regions: the West-Central Guineo-Congolian region and the coastal and montane regions of East Africa. These regions have strong floristic affinities with each other, suggesting a former connection via an Eocene pan-African rain forest. High levels of endemism observed in both regions have been hypothesized to be the result of either 1) a single break-up followed by a long isolation or 2) multiple fragmentation and reconnection since the Oligocene. To test these hypotheses the evolutionary history of endemic taxa within a rain forest restricted African lineage of the plant family Annonaceae was studied. Molecular phylogenies and divergence dates were estimated using a Bayesian relaxed uncorrelated molecular clock assumption accounting for both calibration and phylogenetic uncertainties. Our results provide strong evidence that East African endemic lineages of Annonaceae have multiple origins dated to significantly different times spanning the Oligocene and Miocene epochs. Moreover, these successive origins (c. 33, 16 and 8 million years--Myr) coincide with known periods of aridification and geological activity in Africa that would have recurrently isolated the Guineo-Congolian rain forest from the East African one. All East African taxa were found to have diversified prior to Pleistocene times. Molecular phylogenetic dating analyses of this large pan-African clade of Annonaceae unravels an interesting pattern of diversification for rain forest restricted trees co-occurring in West/Central and East African rain forests. Our results suggest that repeated reconnections between the West/Central and East African rain forest blocks allowed for biotic exchange while the break-ups induced speciation via vicariance, enhancing the levels of endemicity. These results provide an explanation for present day distribution patterns and origins of endemicity for African rain forest trees. Moreover, given the pre-Pleistocene origins of all the studied endemic East African genera and species, these results also offer important insights for setting conservation priorities in these highly diversified but threatened ecosystems.
3 Enhanced expression of Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway members in human diabetic nephropathy. Glomerular mesangial expansion and podocyte loss are important early features of diabetic nephropathy, whereas tubulointerstitial injury and fibrosis are critical for progression of diabetic nephropathy to kidney failure. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of genes in glomeruli and tubulointerstitium in kidney biopsies from diabetic nephropathy patients to identify pathways that may be activated in humans but not in murine models of diabetic nephropathy that fail to progress to glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and kidney failure. Kidney biopsies were obtained from 74 patients (control subjects, early and progressive type 2 diabetic nephropathy). Glomerular and tubulointerstitial mRNAs were microarrayed, followed by bioinformatics analyses. Gene expression changes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistological staining. Samples from db/db C57BLKS and streptozotocin-induced DBA/2J mice, commonly studied murine models of diabetic nephropathy, were analyzed. In human glomeruli and tubulointerstitial samples, the Janus kinase (Jak)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) pathway was highly and significantly regulated. Jak-1, -2, and -3 as well as Stat-1 and -3 were expressed at higher levels in patients with diabetic nephropathy than in control subjects. The estimated glomerular filtration rate significantly correlated with tubulointerstitial Jak-1, -2, and -3 and Stat-1 expression (R(2) = 0.30-0.44). Immunohistochemistry found strong Jak-2 staining in glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments in diabetic nephropathy compared with control subjects. In contrast, there was little or no increase in expression of Jak/Stat genes in the db/db C57BLKS or diabetic DBA/2J mice. These data suggest a direct relationship between tubulointerstitial Jak/Stat expression and progression of kidney failure in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy and distinguish progressive human diabetic nephropathy from nonprogressive murine diabetic nephropathy.
0 Transmission potential, skin inflammatory response, and parasitism of symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs with visceral leishmaniasis. Visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil is caused by the protozoan Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi and it is transmitted by sandfly of the genus Lutzomyia. Dogs are an important domestic reservoir, and control of the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) to humans includes the elimination of infected dogs. However, though dogs are considered to be an important element in the transmission cycle of Leishmania, the identification of infected dogs representing an immediate risk for transmission has not been properly evaluated. Since it is not possible to treat infected dogs, they are sacrificed when a diagnosis of VL is established, a measure that is difficult to accomplish in highly endemic areas. In such areas, parameters that allow for easy identification of reservoirs that represents an immediate risk for transmission is of great importance for the control of VL transmission. In this study we aimed to identify clinical parameters, reinforced by pathological parameters that characterize dogs with potential to transmit the parasite to the vector. The major clinical manifestations of visceral leishmaniasis in dogs from an endemic area were onicogriphosis, skin lesions, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. The transmission potential of these dogs was assessed by xenodiagnosis using Lutzomyia longipalpis. Six of nine symptomatic dogs were infective to Lutzomyia longipalpis while none of the five asymptomatic dogs were infective to the sandfly. Leishmania amastigotes were present in the skin of all clinically symptomatic dogs, but absent in asymptomatic dogs. Higher parasite loads were observed in the ear and ungueal region, and lower in abdomen. The inflammatory infiltrate was more intense in the ears and ungueal regions of both symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs. In clinically affected dogs in which few or none Leishmania amastigotes were observed, the inflammatory infiltrate was constituted mainly of lymphocytes and macrophages. When many parasites were present, the infiltrate was also comprised of lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as a larger quantity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Dogs that represent an immediate risk for transmission of Leishmania in endemic areas present clinical manifestations that include onicogriphosis, skin lesions, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Lymphadenopathy in particular was a positive clinical hallmark since it was closely related to the positive xenodiagnosis.
1 Combined anomaly of the right hepatic lobe agenesis and absence of the inferior vena cava: a case report. The absence of the inferior vena cava is an uncommon congenital anomaly that has recently been identified as an important risk factor contributing to the development of deep venous thrombosis. Congenital agenesis of the right hepatic lobe is a rare anomaly which is found incidentally in radiologic examinations. We present a case of a congenital absence of the infrarenal inferior vena cava, combined with agenesis of the right hepatic lobe in a 62-year-old man presented with symptoms of deep venous thrombosis.
3 Influenza a virus induces an immediate cytotoxic activity in all major subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A replication defective influenza A vaccine virus (delNS1 virus) was developed. Its attenuation is due to potent stimulation of the innate immune system by the virus. Since the innate immune system can also target cancer cells, we reasoned that delNS1 virus induced immune-stimulation should also lead to the induction of innate cytotoxic effects towards cancer cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated CD56+, CD3+, CD14+ and CD19+ subsets and different combinations of the above subsets were stimulated by delNS1, wild type (wt) virus or heat inactivated virus and co-cultured with tumor cell lines in the presence or absence of antibodies against the interferon system. Stimulation of PBMCs by the delNS1 virus effectively induced cytotoxicity against different cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, virus induced cytotoxicity was exerted by all major subtypes of PBMCs including CD56+, CD3+, CD14+ and CD19+ cells. Virus induced cytotoxicity in CD3+, CD14+ and CD19+ cells was dependent on virus replication, whereas virus induced cytotoxicity in CD56+ cells was only dependent on the binding of the virus. Virus induced cytotoxicity of isolated cell cultures of CD14+, CD19+ or CD56+ cells could be partially blocked by antibodies against type I and type II (IFN) interferon. In contrast, virus induced cytotoxicity in the complete PBMC preparation could not be inhibited by blocking type I or type II IFN, indicating a redundant system of activation in whole blood. Our data suggest that apart from their well known specialized functions all main subsets of peripheral blood cells also initially exert a cytotoxic effect upon virus stimulation. This closely links the innate immune system to the adaptive immune response and renders delNS1 virus a potential therapeutic tool for viro-immunotherapy of cancer.
1 Nonpalpable breast masses: evaluation by US elastography. To compare the diagnostic performances of conventional ultrasound (US) and US elastography for the differentiation of nonpalpable breast masses, and to evaluate whether elastography is helpful at reducing the number of benign biopsies, using histological analysis as a reference standard. Conventional US and real-time elastographic images were obtained for 100 women who had been scheduled for a US-guided core biopsy of 100 nonpalpable breast masses (83 benign, 17 malignant). Two experienced radiologists unaware of the biopsy and clinical findings analyzed conventional US and elastographic images by consensus, and classified lesions based on degree of suspicion regarding the probability of malignancy. Results were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. In addition, the authors investigated whether a subset of lesions was categorized as suspicious by conventional US, but as benign by elastography. Areas under the ROC curves (Az values) were 0.901 for conventional US and 0.916 for elastography (p = 0.808). For BI-RADS category 4a lesions, 44% (22 of 50) had an elasticity score of 1 and all were found to be benign. Elastography was found to have a diagnostic performance comparable to that of conventional US for the differentiation of nonpalpable breast masses. The authors conclude that BI-RADS category 4a lesions with an elasticity score of 1 probably do not require biopsy.
2 Foreign body inclusion cyst of the nasal radix after augmentation rhinoplasty. Development of a cystic mass on the nasal dorsum is a very rare complication of aesthetic rhinoplasty. Most reported cases are of mucous cyst and entrapment of the nasal mucosa in the subcutaneous space due to traumatic surgical technique has been suggested as a presumptive pathogenesis. Here, we report a case of dorsal nasal cyst that had a different pathogenesis for cyst formation. A 58-yr-old woman developed a large cystic mass on the nasal radix 30 yr after augmentation rhinoplasty with silicone material. The mass was removed via a direct open approach and the pathology findings revealed a foreign body inclusion cyst associated with silicone. Successful nasal reconstruction was performed with autologous cartilages. Discussion and a brief review of the literature will be focused on the pathophysiology of and treatment options for a postrhinoplasty dorsal cyst.
0 mtDNAmanager: a Web-based tool for the management and quality analysis of mitochondrial DNA control-region sequences. For the past few years, scientific controversy has surrounded the large number of errors in forensic and literature mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data. However, recent research has shown that using mtDNA phylogeny and referring to known mtDNA haplotypes can be useful for checking the quality of sequence data. We developed a Web-based bioinformatics resource "mtDNAmanager" that offers a convenient interface supporting the management and quality analysis of mtDNA sequence data. The mtDNAmanager performs computations on mtDNA control-region sequences to estimate the most-probable mtDNA haplogroups and retrieves similar sequences from a selected database. By the phased designation of the most-probable haplogroups (both expected and estimated haplogroups), mtDNAmanager enables users to systematically detect errors whilst allowing for confirmation of the presence of clear key diagnostic mutations and accompanying mutations. The query tools of mtDNAmanager also facilitate database screening with two options of "match" and "include the queried nucleotide polymorphism". In addition, mtDNAmanager provides Web interfaces for users to manage and analyse their own data in batch mode. The mtDNAmanager will provide systematic routines for mtDNA sequence data management and analysis via easily accessible Web interfaces, and thus should be very useful for population, medical and forensic studies that employ mtDNA analysis. mtDNAmanager can be accessed at http://mtmanager.yonsei.ac.kr.
3 The functional expression and characterisation of a cysteine peptidase from the invasive stage of the neuropathogenic schistosome Trichobilharzia regenti. A transcriptional product of a gene encoding cathepsin B-like peptidase in the bird schistosome Trichobilharzia regenti was identified and cloned. The enzyme was named TrCB2 due to its 77% sequence similarity to cathepsin B2 from the important human parasite Schistosoma mansoni. The zymogen was expressed in the methylotropic yeast Pichia pastoris; procathepsin B2 underwent self-processing in yeast media. The peptidolytic activity of the recombinant enzyme was characterised using synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates at optimal pH 6.0. Functional studies using different specific inhibitors proved the typical cathepsin B-like nature of the enzyme. The S(2) subsite specificity profile of recombinant TrCB2 was obtained. Using monospecific antibodies against the recombinant enzyme, the presence of cathepsin B2 was confirmed in extracts from cercariae (infective stage) and schistosomula (early post-cercarial stage) of T. regenti on Western blots. Also, cross-reactivity was observed between T. regenti and S. mansoni cathepsins B2 in extracts of cercariae, schistosomula or adults. In T. regenti, the antisera localised the enzyme to post-acetabular penetration glands of cercariae implying an important role in the penetration of host skin. The ability of recombinant TrCB2 to degrade skin, serum and nervous tissue proteins was evident. Elastinolytic activity suggests that the enzyme might functionally substitute the histolytic role of the serine class elastase known from S. mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium but not found in Schistosoma japonicum or in bird schistosomes.
0 A trouble shared is a trouble halved: social context and status affect pain in mouse dyads. In mice behavioral response to pain is modulated by social status. Recently, social context also has been shown to affect pain sensitivity. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effects of interaction between status and social context in dyads of outbred CD-1 male mice in which the dominance/submission relationship was stable. Mice were assessed for pain response in a formalin (1% concentration) test either alone (individually tested-IT), or in pairs of dominant and subordinate mice. In the latter condition, they could be either both injected (BI) or only one injected (OI) with formalin. We observed a remarkable influence of social context on behavioral response to painful stimuli regardless of the social status of the mice. In the absence of differences between OI and IT conditions, BI mice exhibited half as much Paw-licking behavior than OI group. As expected, subordinates were hypoalgesic in response to the early phase of the formalin effects compared to dominants. Clear cut-differences in coping strategies of dominants and subordinates appeared. The former were more active, whereas the latter were more passive. Finally, analysis of behavior of the non-injected subjects (the observers) in the OI dyads revealed that dominant observers were more often involved in Self-grooming behavior upon observation of their subordinate partner in pain. This was not the case for subordinate mice observing the pain response of their dominant partner. In contrast, subordinate observers Stared at the dominant significantly more frequently compared to observer dominants in other dyads. The observation of a cagemate in pain significantly affected the observer's behavior. Additionally, the quality of observer's response was also modulated by the dominance/submission relationship.
0 Right-left discrimination among medical students: questionnaire and psychometric study. To determine medical students' self awareness and ability to discriminate right from left; to identify characteristics associated with this ability; and to identify any techniques used to aid discrimination. Questionnaire and psychometric study. Undergraduate medical school, Northern Ireland. 290 first year undergraduate students. Medical students' ability to discriminate right from left using the Bergen right-left discrimination test. Test scores ranged from 31 to 143 on a scale of 0-144 (mean 112 (standard deviation 22.2)). Male students significantly outperformed female students (117.18 (26.96) v 110.80 (28.94)). Students who wanted to be surgeons performed significantly better than those who wanted to be general practitioners or medical doctors (119.87 (25.15) v 110.55 (27.36) v 112.50 (26.88)). The interaction effect for sex and career wishes was not significant (P=0.370). Students who used learnt techniques to help them discriminate scored significantly less than those who did not (P<0.001). Students had greater difficulty in discriminating right from left when looking at the forward view rather than the back view (P<0.001). Male students were better than female students at distinguishing right from left, and aspiring surgeons were better than aspiring general practitioners or medical doctors. Students had more difficulty with the forward view than the back view.
3 Display of cell surface sites for fibronectin assembly is modulated by cell adherence to (1)F3 and C-terminal modules of fibronectin. Fibronectin-null cells assemble soluble fibronectin shortly after adherence to a substrate coated with intact fibronectin but not when adherent to the cell-binding domain of fibronectin (modules (7)F3-(10)F3). Interactions of adherent cells with regions of adsorbed fibronectin other than modules (7)F3-(10)F3, therefore, are required for early display of the cell surface sites that initiate and direct fibronectin assembly. To identify these regions, coatings of proteolytically derived or recombinant pieces of fibronectin containing modules in addition to (7)F3-(10)F3 were tested for effects on fibronectin assembly by adherent fibronectin-null fibroblasts. Pieces as large as one comprising modules (2)F3-(14)F3, which include the heparin-binding and cell adhesion domains, were not effective in supporting fibronectin assembly. Addition of module (1)F3 or the C-terminal modules to modules (2)F3-(14)F3 resulted in some activity, and addition of both (1)F3 and the C-terminal modules resulted in a construct, (1)F3-C, that best mimicked the activity of a coating of intact fibronectin. Constructs (1)F3-C V0, (1)F3-C V64, and (1)F3-C Delta(V(15)F3(10)F1) were all able to support fibronectin assembly, suggesting that (1)F3 through (11)F1 and/or (12)F1 were important for activity. Coatings in which the active parts of (1)F3-C were present in different proteins were much less active than intact (1)F3-C. These results suggest that (1)F3 acts together with C-terminal modules to induce display of fibronectin assembly sites on adherent cells.
0 Learning a prior on regulatory potential from eQTL data. Genome-wide RNA expression data provide a detailed view of an organism's biological state; hence, a dataset measuring expression variation between genetically diverse individuals (eQTL data) may provide important insights into the genetics of complex traits. However, with data from a relatively small number of individuals, it is difficult to distinguish true causal polymorphisms from the large number of possibilities. The problem is particularly challenging in populations with significant linkage disequilibrium, where traits are often linked to large chromosomal regions containing many genes. Here, we present a novel method, Lirnet, that automatically learns a regulatory potential for each sequence polymorphism, estimating how likely it is to have a significant effect on gene expression. This regulatory potential is defined in terms of "regulatory features"-including the function of the gene and the conservation, type, and position of genetic polymorphisms-that are available for any organism. The extent to which the different features influence the regulatory potential is learned automatically, making Lirnet readily applicable to different datasets, organisms, and feature sets. We apply Lirnet both to the human HapMap eQTL dataset and to a yeast eQTL dataset and provide statistical and biological results demonstrating that Lirnet produces significantly better regulatory programs than other recent approaches. We demonstrate in the yeast data that Lirnet can correctly suggest a specific causal sequence variation within a large, linked chromosomal region. In one example, Lirnet uncovered a novel, experimentally validated connection between Puf3-a sequence-specific RNA binding protein-and P-bodies-cytoplasmic structures that regulate translation and RNA stability-as well as the particular causative polymorphism, a SNP in Mkt1, that induces the variation in the pathway.
0 Dose dependent effects of platelet derived chondroitinsulfate A on the binding of CCL5 to endothelial cells. Chemokines immobilized on endothelial cells play a central role in the induced firm adhesion and transendothelial migration of leukocytes. Activation of platelets at sites of vascular injury is considered to support leukocyte adhesion and extravasation. However, activated platelets also secrete soluble glycosaminoglycans that can interfere with immobilization of chemokines. We therefore analyzed the impact of platelet derived glycosaminoglycans on the immobilization of the chemokine CCL5 (RANTES) on human microvascular endothelial cells and their influence on CCL5-CCR5 interactions. We confirm that undiluted serum in contrast to plasma decreases binding of CCL5 to endothelial cells. However, when lower concentrations of serum were used, CCL5-presentation on endothelial cells was markedly enhanced. This enhancement was neutralized if serum was digested with chondroinitase ABC. Using different chondroitinsulfate-subtypes we demonstrate that chondroitinsulfate A mediates the enhanced presentation of CCL5 on endothelial cells, whereas chondroitinsulfate B/C even at low concentrations block CCL5 binding. CCR5 downregulation on CCR5-transfected CHO cells or human monocytes is increased by preincubation of CCL5 with serum or chondroitinsulfate A. We show that chondroitinsulfate A released from platelets increases the binding of chemokines to endothelial cells and supports receptor internalization in a dose dependent manner. These data help to understand the proinflammatory effects of activated platelets.
3 Reduced diversity and increased virulence-gene carriage in intestinal enterobacteria of coeliac children. Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathology triggered by the ingestion of cereal gluten proteins. This disorder is associated with imbalances in the composition of the gut microbiota that could be involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether intestinal Enterobacteriaceae populations of active and non-active coeliac patients and healthy children differ in diversity and virulence-gene carriage, so as to establish a possible link between the pathogenic potential of enterobacteria and the disease. Enterobacteriaceae clones were isolated on VRBD agar from faecal samples of 31 subjects (10 active coeliac patients, 10 symptom-free coeliac patients and 11 healthy controls) and identified at species level by the API 20E system. Escherichia coli clones were classified into four phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2 and D and the prevalence of eight virulence-associated genes (type-1 fimbriae [fimA], P fimbriae [papC], S fimbriae [sfaD/E], Dr haemagglutinin [draA], haemolysin [hlyA], capsule K1 [neuB], capsule K5 [KfiC] and aerobactin [iutA]) was determined by multiplex PCR. A total of 155 Enterobacteriaceae clones were isolated. Non-E. coli clones were more commonly isolated in healthy children than in coeliac patients. The four phylogenetic E. coli groups were equally distributed in healthy children, while in both coeliac patients most commensal isolates belonged to group A. Within the virulent groups, B2 was the most prevalent in active coeliac disease children, while D was the most prevalent in non-active coeliac patients. E coli clones of the virulent phylogenetic groups (B2+D) from active and non-active coeliac patients carried a higher number of virulence genes than those from healthy individuals. Prevalence of P fimbriae (papC), capsule K5 (sfaD/E) and haemolysin (hlyA) genes was higher in E. coli isolated from active and non-active coeliac children than in those from control subjects. This study has demonstrated that virulence features of the enteric microbiota are linked to coeliac disease.
3 Insulin gene mutations as cause of diabetes in children negative for five type 1 diabetes autoantibodies. Heterozygous, gain-of-function mutations of the insulin gene can cause permanent diabetes with onset ranging from the neonatal period through adulthood. The aim of our study was to screen for the insulin gene in patients who had been clinically classified as type 1 diabetic but who tested negative for type 1 diabetes autoantibodies. We reviewed the clinical records of 326 patients with the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and identified seven probands who had diabetes in isolation and were negative for five type 1 diabetes autoantibodies. We sequenced the INS gene in these seven patients. In two patients whose diabetes onset had been at 2 years 10 months of age and at 6 years 8 months of age, respectively, we identified the mutation G(B8)S and a novel mutation in the preproinsulin signal peptide (A(Signal23)S). Insulin gene mutations are rare in absolute terms in patients classified as type 1 diabetic (0.6%) but can be identified after a thorough screening of type 1 diabetes autoantibodies.
2 Safety, humoral and cell mediated immune responses to two formulations of an inactivated, split-virion influenza A/H5N1 vaccine in children. Highly pathogenic influenza A/H5N1 has caused outbreaks in wild birds and poultry in Asia, Africa and Europe. It has also infected people, especially children, causing severe illness and death. Although the virus shows limited ability to transmit between humans, A/H5N1 represents a potential source of the next influenza pandemic. This study assesses the safety and immunogenicity of aluminium hydroxide adjuvanted (Al) and non adjuvanted influenza A/Vietnam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1) vaccine in children. In a Phase II, open, randomised, multicentre trial 180 children aged 6 months to 17 years received two injections, 21 days apart, of vaccine containing either: 30 microg haemagglutinin (HA) with adjuvant (30 microg+Al) or 7.5 microg HA without adjuvant. An additional 60 children aged 6-35 months received two "half dose" injections (ie 15 microg+Al or 3.8 microg). Safety was followed for 21 days after vaccination. Antibody responses were assessed 21 days after each injection and cellular immune responses were explored. Vaccination appeared well tolerated in all age groups. The 30 microg+Al formulation was more immunogenic than 7.5 microg in all age groups: in these two groups 79% and 46% had haemagglutinination inhibition antibody titres > or =32 (1/dil). Among 6-35 month-olds, the full doses were more immunogenic than their half dose equivalents. Vaccination induced a predominantly Th2 response against H5 HA. This influenza A(H5N1) vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic in children and infants, with Al adjuvant providing a clear immunogenic advantage. These results demonstrate that an H5N1 Al-adjuvanted vaccine, previously shown to be immunogenic and safe in adults, can also be used in children, the group most at risk for pandemic influenza.
1 Using a spatial filter and a geographic information system to improve rabies surveillance data. The design and coordination of antirabies measures (e.g., oral vaccine and disease awareness campaigns) often depend on surveillance data. In Kentucky, health officials are concerned that the raccoon rabies epizootic that has spread throughout the east coast since the late 1970s could enter the state. The quality of surveillance data from Kentucky's 120 counties, however, may not be consistent. This article presents a geographic model that can be used with a geographic information system (GIS) to assess whether a county has a lower number of animals submitted for rabies testing than surrounding counties. This technique can be used as a first step in identifying areas needing improvement in their surveillance scheme. This model is a variant of a spatial filter that uses points within an area of analysis (usually a circle) to estimate the value of a central point. The spatial filter is an easy-to-use method of identifying point patterns, such as clusters or holes, at various geographic scales (county, intraurban), by using the traditional circle as an area of analysis or a GIS to incorporate a political shape (county boundary).
0 Sustained activation of STAT5 is essential for chromatin remodeling and maintenance of mammary-specific function. Epithelial cells, once dissociated and placed in two-dimensional (2D) cultures, rapidly lose tissue-specific functions. We showed previously that in addition to prolactin, signaling by laminin-111 was necessary to restore functional differentiation of mammary epithelia. Here, we elucidate two additional aspects of laminin-111 action. We show that in 2D cultures, the prolactin receptor is basolaterally localized and physically segregated from its apically placed ligand. Detachment of the cells exposes the receptor to ligation by prolactin leading to signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 5 (STAT5) activation, but only transiently and not sufficiently for induction of milk protein expression. We show that laminin-111 reorganizes mammary cells into polarized acini, allowing both the exposure of the prolactin receptor and sustained activation of STAT5. The use of constitutively active STAT5 constructs showed that the latter is necessary and sufficient for chromatin reorganization and beta-casein transcription. These results underscore the crucial role of continuous laminin signaling and polarized tissue architecture in maintenance of transcription factor activation, chromatin organization, and tissue-specific gene expression.
0 Intrahepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis mimicking a hypervascular hepatic neoplasm on dynamic- and SPIO-enhanced MRI. We present a rare case of a focal intrahepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) that mimicked a hypervascular hepatic neoplasm in a 33-year-old woman with idiopathic myelofibrosis. The lesion showed homogeneous and persistent enhancement on both contrast-enhanced CT and gadolinium-enhanced dynamic MR imaging. The lesion did not demonstrate an apparent signal drop on a T2-weighted sequence following administration of a superparamagnetic iron-oxide agent (SHU 555A). A hepatocellular adenoma was the initial radiological diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a histopathologically proven intrahepatic EMH evaluated with dynamic- and SPIO-enhanced MRI.
1 Anterior cruciate ligament tear: reliability of MR imaging to predict stability after conservative treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the reliability of MR imaging to predict the stability of the torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after complete recovery of the ligament's continuity. Twenty patients with 20 knee injuries (13 males and 7 females; age range, 20-54) were enrolled in the study. The inclusion criteria were a positive history of acute trauma, diagnosis of the ACL tear by both the physical examination and the MR imaging at the initial presentation, conservative treatment, complete recovery of the continuity of the ligament on the follow up (FU) MR images and availability of the KT-2000 measurements. Two radiologists, who worked in consensus, graded the MR findings with using a 3-point system for the signal intensity, sharpness, straightness and the thickness of the healed ligament. The insufficiency of ACL was categorized into three groups according to the KT-2000 measurements. The statistic correlations between the grades of the MR findings and the degrees of ACL insufficiency were analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (p < 0.05). The p-values for each category of the MR findings according to the different groups of the KT-2000 measurements were 0.9180 for the MR signal intensity, 1.0000 for sharpness, 0.5038 for straightness and 0.2950 for thickness of the ACL. The MR findings were not significantly different between the different KT-2000 groups. MR imaging itself is not a reliable examination to predict stability of the ACL rupture outcome, even when the MR images show an intact appearance of the ACL.
0 Expression of the multiple sclerosis-associated MHC class II Allele HLA-DRB1*1501 is regulated by vitamin D. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex trait in which allelic variation in the MHC class II region exerts the single strongest effect on genetic risk. Epidemiological data in MS provide strong evidence that environmental factors act at a population level to influence the unusual geographical distribution of this disease. Growing evidence implicates sunlight or vitamin D as a key environmental factor in aetiology. We hypothesised that this environmental candidate might interact with inherited factors and sought responsive regulatory elements in the MHC class II region. Sequence analysis localised a single MHC vitamin D response element (VDRE) to the promoter region of HLA-DRB1. Sequencing of this promoter in greater than 1,000 chromosomes from HLA-DRB1 homozygotes showed absolute conservation of this putative VDRE on HLA-DRB1*15 haplotypes. In contrast, there was striking variation among non-MS-associated haplotypes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed specific recruitment of vitamin D receptor to the VDRE in the HLA-DRB1*15 promoter, confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using lymphoblastoid cells homozygous for HLA-DRB1*15. Transient transfection using a luciferase reporter assay showed a functional role for this VDRE. B cells transiently transfected with the HLA-DRB1*15 gene promoter showed increased expression on stimulation with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (P = 0.002) that was lost both on deletion of the VDRE or with the homologous "VDRE" sequence found in non-MS-associated HLA-DRB1 haplotypes. Flow cytometric analysis showed a specific increase in the cell surface expression of HLA-DRB1 upon addition of vitamin D only in HLA-DRB1*15 bearing lymphoblastoid cells. This study further implicates vitamin D as a strong environmental candidate in MS by demonstrating direct functional interaction with the major locus determining genetic susceptibility. These findings support a connection between the main epidemiological and genetic features of this disease with major practical implications for studies of disease mechanism and prevention.
0 GenomeGraphs: integrated genomic data visualization with R. Biological studies involve a growing number of distinct high-throughput experiments to characterize samples of interest. There is a lack of methods to visualize these different genomic datasets in a versatile manner. In addition, genomic data analysis requires integrated visualization of experimental data along with constantly changing genomic annotation and statistical analyses. We developed GenomeGraphs, as an add-on software package for the statistical programming environment R, to facilitate integrated visualization of genomic datasets. GenomeGraphs uses the biomaRt package to perform on-line annotation queries to Ensembl and translates these to gene/transcript structures in viewports of the grid graphics package. This allows genomic annotation to be plotted together with experimental data. GenomeGraphs can also be used to plot custom annotation tracks in combination with different experimental data types together in one plot using the same genomic coordinate system. GenomeGraphs is a flexible and extensible software package which can be used to visualize a multitude of genomic datasets within the statistical programming environment R.
3 Re-emergence of tularemia in Germany: presence of Francisella tularensis in different rodent species in endemic areas. Tularemia re-emerged in Germany starting in 2004 (with 39 human cases from 2004 to 2007) after over 40 years of only sporadic human infections. The reasons for this rise in case numbers are unknown as is the possible reservoir of the etiologic agent Francisella (F.) tularensis. No systematic study on the reservoir situation of F. tularensis has been published for Germany so far. We investigated three areas six to ten months after the initial tularemia outbreaks for the presence of F. tularensis among small mammals, ticks/fleas and water. The investigations consisted of animal live-trapping, serologic testing, screening by real-time-PCR and cultivation. A total of 386 small mammals were trapped. F. tularensis was detected in five different rodent species with carrier rates of 2.04, 6.94 and 10.87% per trapping area. None of the ticks or fleas (n = 432) tested positive for F. tularensis. We were able to demonstrate F. tularensis-specific DNA in one of 28 water samples taken in one of the outbreak areas. The findings of our study stress the need for long-term surveillance of natural foci in order to get a better understanding of the reasons for the temporal and spatial patterns of tularemia in Germany.
1 Multivariate gene expression analysis reveals functional connectivity changes between normal/tumoral prostates. Prostate cancer is a leading cause of death in the male population, therefore, a comprehensive study about the genes and the molecular networks involved in the tumoral prostate process becomes necessary. In order to understand the biological process behind potential biomarkers, we have analyzed a set of 57 cDNA microarrays containing approximately 25,000 genes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with the Maximum-entropy Linear Discriminant Analysis (MLDA) were applied in order to identify genes with the most discriminative information between normal and tumoral prostatic tissues. Data analysis was carried out using three different approaches, namely: (i) differences in gene expression levels between normal and tumoral conditions from an univariate point of view; (ii) in a multivariate fashion using MLDA; and (iii) with a dependence network approach. Our results show that malignant transformation in the prostatic tissue is more related to functional connectivity changes in their dependence networks than to differential gene expression. The MYLK, KLK2, KLK3, HAN11, LTF, CSRP1 and TGM4 genes presented significant changes in their functional connectivity between normal and tumoral conditions and were also classified as the top seven most informative genes for the prostate cancer genesis process by our discriminant analysis. Moreover, among the identified genes we found classically known biomarkers and genes which are closely related to tumoral prostate, such as KLK3 and KLK2 and several other potential ones. We have demonstrated that changes in functional connectivity may be implicit in the biological process which renders some genes more informative to discriminate between normal and tumoral conditions. Using the proposed method, namely, MLDA, in order to analyze the multivariate characteristic of genes, it was possible to capture the changes in dependence networks which are related to cell transformation.
0 Retinal artery occlusion in a healthy pregnant patient. We report a case of branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) in a healthy pregnant woman. A 29-year-old pregnant woman presented with decreased vision in her left eye. She had a pale retina with macular edema consistent with BRAO. An extensive workup was performed to determine an etiologic factor. All test results were within normal limits except for her factor VIII activity. Her visual acuity improved from finger counting to 20/30 over 2 months without any treatment. This case suggests that BRAO can occur in healthy patients without any systemic or ocular disorders. BRAO can occur in healthy patients without any systemic or ocular disorders, despite an extensile evaluation.
3 Cortisol release from adipose tissue by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in humans. 11beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) regenerates cortisol from cortisone. 11beta-HSD1 mRNA and activity are increased in vitro in subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese patients. Inhibition of 11beta-HSD1 is a promising therapeutic approach in type 2 diabetes. However, release of cortisol by 11beta-HSD1 from adipose tissue and its effect on portal vein cortisol concentrations have not been quantified in vivo. Six healthy men underwent 9,11,12,12-[(2)H](4)-cortisol infusions with simultaneous sampling of arterialized and superficial epigastric vein blood sampling. Four men with stable chronic liver disease and a transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt in situ underwent tracer infusion with simultaneous sampling from the portal vein, hepatic vein, and an arterialized peripheral vein. Significant cortisol and 9,12,12-[(2)H](3)-cortisol release were observed from subcutaneous adipose tissue (15.0 [95% CI 0.4-29.5] and 8.7 [0.2-17.2] pmol . min(-1) . 100 g(-1) adipose tissue, respectively). Splanchnic release of cortisol and 9,12,12-[(2)H](3)-cortisol (13.5 [3.6-23.5] and 8.0 [2.6-13.5] nmol/min, respectively) was accounted for entirely by the liver; release of cortisol from visceral tissues into portal vein was not detected. Cortisol is released from subcutaneous adipose tissue by 11beta-HSD1 in humans, and increased enzyme expression in obesity is likely to increase local glucocorticoid signaling and contribute to whole-body cortisol regeneration. However, visceral adipose 11beta-HSD1 activity is insufficient to increase portal vein cortisol concentrations and hence to influence intrahepatic glucocorticoid signaling.
2 The prognosis for pain, disability, activities of daily living and quality of life after an acute osteoporotic vertebral body fracture: its relation to fracture level, type of fracture and grade of fracture deformation. The level of the acute osteoporotic vertebral fracture, fracture type and grade of fracture deformation were determined in 107 consecutive patients and related to pain, disability, activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL) after 3 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months. Two-thirds of the fractured patients were women and with a similar average age, around 75 years, as the men. Fifty-eight of the acute fractures were located in the thoracic spine and 49 in the lumbar spine and predominantly at the Th12 and L1 levels. Sixty-nine percent of the fractures were wedge, 19% concave and 12% crush fractures. There were 22 mildly, 50 moderately and 35 severely deformed vertebrae. The grade of fracture deformation was not related to gender, age or fracture location. Severely deformed vertebrae predominantly (92%) occurred among the crush fracture type. One year after the fracture, irrespective of fracture level, fracture type or grade of fracture deformation, 4/5 still had pronounced pain and deteriorated QoL. Initial severe fracture deformation by far was the worst prognostic factor for severe lasting pain and disability, and deterioration of ADL and QoL. Factors like fracture level, lumbar fractures tended to improve steadily while thoracic deteriorated, type of fracture, the wedge and concave resulting in less pain and better QoL than the crush fracture type and gender influenced to a lesser extent the outcomes during the year after the acute fracture.
1 Multisensory oddity detection as bayesian inference. A key goal for the perceptual system is to optimally combine information from all the senses that may be available in order to develop the most accurate and unified picture possible of the outside world. The contemporary theoretical framework of ideal observer maximum likelihood integration (MLI) has been highly successful in modelling how the human brain combines information from a variety of different sensory modalities. However, in various recent experiments involving multisensory stimuli of uncertain correspondence, MLI breaks down as a successful model of sensory combination. Within the paradigm of direct stimulus estimation, perceptual models which use Bayesian inference to resolve correspondence have recently been shown to generalize successfully to these cases where MLI fails. This approach has been known variously as model inference, causal inference or structure inference. In this paper, we examine causal uncertainty in another important class of multi-sensory perception paradigm--that of oddity detection and demonstrate how a Bayesian ideal observer also treats oddity detection as a structure inference problem. We validate this approach by showing that it provides an intuitive and quantitative explanation of an important pair of multi-sensory oddity detection experiments--involving cues across and within modalities--for which MLI previously failed dramatically, allowing a novel unifying treatment of within and cross modal multisensory perception. Our successful application of structure inference models to the new 'oddity detection' paradigm, and the resultant unified explanation of across and within modality cases provide further evidence to suggest that structure inference may be a commonly evolved principle for combining perceptual information in the brain.
3 Phosphatase inhibitor 2 promotes acetylation of tubulin in the primary cilium of human retinal epithelial cells. Primary cilia are flagella-like projections from the centriole of mammalian cells that have a key role in cell signaling. Human diseases are linked to defects in primary cilia. Microtubules make up the axoneme of cilia and are selectively acetylated and this is thought to contribute to the stability of the structure. However, mechanisms to regulate tubulin acetylation in cilia are poorly understood. Endogenous phosphatase inhibitor-2 (I-2) was found concentrated in cilia of human epithelial cells, and was localized to cilia early in the process of formation, prior to the full acetylation of microtubules. Knockdown of I-2 by siRNA significantly reduced the acetylation of microtubules in cilia, without a net decrease in whole cell tubulin acetylation. There was a reduction in the percentage of I-2 knockdown cells with a primary cilium, but no apparent alteration in the cilium length, suggesting no change in microtubule-based transport processes. Inhibition of either histone deacetylases with trichostatin A, or protein phosphatase-1 with calyculin A in I-2 knockdown cells partially rescued the acetylation of microtubules in cilia and the percentage of cells with a primary cilium. The regulatory protein I-2 localizes to the primary cilium where it affects both Ser/Thr phosphorylation and is required for full tubulin acetylation. Rescue of tubulin acetylation in I-2 knockdown cells by different chemical inhibitors shows that deacetylases and phosphatases are functionally interconnected to regulate microtubules. As a multifunctional protein, I-2 may link cell cycle progression to structure and stability of the primary cilium.
2 A multimedia mobile phone-based youth smoking cessation intervention: findings from content development and piloting studies. While most young people who smoke want to quit, few access cessation support services. Mobile phone-based cessation programs are ideal for young people: mobile phones are the most common means of peer communication, and messages can be delivered in an anonymous manner, anywhere, anytime. Following the success of our text messaging smoking cessation program, we developed an innovative multimedia mobile phone smoking cessation intervention. The aim of the study was to develop and pilot test a youth-oriented multimedia smoking cessation intervention delivered solely by mobile phone. Development included creating content and building the technology platform. Content development was overseen by an expert group who advised on youth development principles, observational learning (from social cognitive theory), effective smoking cessation interventions, and social marketing. Young people participated in three content development phases (consultation via focus groups and an online survey, content pre-testing, and selection of role models). Video and text messages were then developed, incorporating the findings from this research. Information technology systems were established to support the delivery of the multimedia messages by mobile phone. A pilot study using an abbreviated 4-week program of video and text content tested the reliability of the systems and the acceptability of the intervention. Approximately 180 young people participated in the consultation phase. There was a high priority placed on music for relaxation (75%) and an interest in interacting with others in the program (40% would read messages, 36% would read a blog). Findings from the pre-testing phase (n = 41) included the importance of selecting "real" and "honest" role models with believable stories, and an interest in animations (37%). Of the 15 participants who took part in the pilot study, 13 (87%) were available for follow-up interviews at 4 weeks: 12 participants liked the program or liked it most of the time and found the role model to be believable; 7 liked the role model video messages (5 were unsure); 8 used the extra assistance for cravings; and 9 were happy with two messages per day. Nine participants (60%) stopped smoking during the program. Some technical challenges were encountered during the pilot study. A multimedia mobile phone smoking cessation program is technically feasible, and the content developed is appropriate for this medium and is acceptable to our target population. These results have informed the design of a 6-month intervention currently being evaluated for its effectiveness in increasing smoking cessation rates in young people.
0 Predicting successful treatment outcome of web-based self-help for problem drinkers: secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial. Web-based self-help interventions for problem drinking are coming of age. They have shown promising results in terms of cost-effectiveness, and they offer opportunities to reach out on a broad scale to problem drinkers. The question now is whether certain groups of problem drinkers benefit more from such Web-based interventions than others. We sought to identify baseline, client-related predictors of the effectiveness of Drinking Less, a 24/7, free-access, interactive, Web-based self-help intervention without therapist guidance for problem drinkers who want to reduce their alcohol consumption. The intervention is based on cognitive-behavioral and self-control principles. We conducted secondary analysis of data from a pragmatic randomized trial with follow-up at 6 and 12 months. Participants (N = 261) were adult problem drinkers in the Dutch general population with a weekly alcohol consumption above 210 g of ethanol for men or 140 g for women, or consumption of at least 60 g (men) or 40 g (women) one or more days a week over the past 3 months. Six baseline participant characteristics were designated as putative predictors of treatment response: (1) gender, (2) education, (3) Internet use competence (sociodemographics), (4) mean weekly alcohol consumption, (5) prior professional help for alcohol problems (level of problem drinking), and (6) participants' expectancies of Web-based interventions for problem drinking. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, using last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) data, and regression imputation (RI) were performed to deal with loss to follow-up. Statistical tests for interaction terms were conducted and linear regression analysis was performed to investigate whether the participants' characteristics as measured at baseline predicted positive treatment responses at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. At 6 months, prior help for alcohol problems predicted a small, marginally significant positive treatment outcome in the RI model only (beta = .18, P = .05, R(2) = .11). At 12 months, females displayed modest predictive power in both imputation models (LOCF: beta = .22, P = .045, R(2) = .02; regression: beta = .27, P = .01, R(2) = .03). Those with higher levels of education exhibited modest predictive power in the LOCF model only (beta = .33, P = .01, R(2) = .03). Although female and more highly educated users appeared slightly more likely to derive benefit from the Drinking Less intervention, none of the baseline characteristics we studied persuasively predicted a favorable treatment outcome. The Web-based intervention therefore seems well suited for a heterogeneous group of problem drinkers and could hence be offered as a first-step treatment in a stepped-care approach directed at problem drinkers in the general population.

0 Fibulin 1 is downregulated through promoter hypermethylation in gastric cancer. Tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) were frequently inactivated through promoter hypermethylation in gastric carcinoma as well as pre-malignant gastric lesions, suggesting that promoter hypermethylation can be used as a marker to define novel TSGs and also biomarkers for early detection of gastric cancer. In an effort to search for such genes aberrantly methylated in gastric cancer development, fibulin 1 (FBLN1) was found as a candidate TSG epigenetically downregulated in gastric cancer. FBLN1 expression was downregulated in all of gastric cancer cell lines used (100%, 7 out of 7) and the primary gastric carcinoma tissues (84%, 86 out of 102) and significantly restored after pharmacological demethylation. Hypermethylation of the FBLN1 promoter was frequently (71%, 5 out of 7) detected in gastric cancer cell lines and primary gastric carcinoma tissues. Ectopic expression of FBLN1 led to the growth inhibition of gastric cancer cells through the induction of apoptosis. In summary, FBLN1 was identified as a novel candidate TSG epigenetically downregulated in gastric cancer.
0 Dilated cardiomyopathy with increased SR Ca2+ loading preceded by a hypercontractile state and diastolic failure in the alpha(1C)TG mouse. Mice over-expressing the alpha(1)_subunit (pore) of the L-type Ca2+ channel (alpha(1C)TG) by 4 months (mo) of age exhibit an enlarged heart, hypertrophied myocytes, increased Ca2+ current and Ca2+ transient amplitude, but a normal SR Ca2+ load. With advancing age (8-11 mo), some mice demonstrate advanced hypertrophy but are not in congestive heart failure (NFTG),while others evolve to frank dilated congestive heart failure (FTG). We demonstrate that older NFTG myocytes exhibit a hypercontractile state over a wide range of stimulation frequencies, but maintain a normal SR Ca2+ load compared to age matched non-transgenic (NTG) myocytes. However, at high stimulation rates (2-4 Hz) signs of diastolic contractile failure appear in NFTG cells. The evolution of frank congestive failure in FTG is accompanied by a further increase in heart mass and myocyte size, and phospholamban and ryanodine receptor protein levels and phosphorylation become reduced. In FTG, the SR Ca2+ load increases and Ca2+ release following excitation, increases further. An enhanced NCX function in FTG, as reflected by an accelerated relaxation of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transient, is insufficient to maintain a normal diastolic Ca2+ during high rates of stimulation. Although a high SR Ca2+ release following excitation is maintained, the hypercontractile state is not maintained at high rates of stimulation, and signs of both systolic and diastolic contractile failure appear. Thus, the dilated cardiomyopathy that evolves in this mouse model exhibits signs of both systolic and diastolic failure, but not a deficient SR Ca2+ loading or release, as occurs in some other cardiomyopathic models.
1 AnEnPi: identification and annotation of analogous enzymes. Enzymes are responsible for the catalysis of the biochemical reactions in metabolic pathways. Analogous enzymes are able to catalyze the same reactions, but they present no significant sequence similarity at the primary level, and possibly different tertiary structures as well. They are thought to have arisen as the result of independent evolutionary events. A detailed study of analogous enzymes may reveal new catalytic mechanisms, add information about the origin and evolution of biochemical pathways and disclose potential targets for drug development. In this work, we have constructed and implemented a new approach, AnEnPi (the Analogous Enzyme Pipeline), using a combination of bioinformatics tools like BLAST, HMMer, and in-house scripts, to assist in the identification, annotation, comparison and study of analogous and homologous enzymes. The algorithm for the detection of analogy is based i) on the construction of groups of homologous enzymes and ii) on the identification of cases where a given enzymatic activity is performed by two or more proteins without significant similarity between their primary structures. We applied this approach to a dataset obtained from KEGG Comprising all annotated enzymes, which resulted in the identification of 986 EC classes where putative analogy was detected (40.5% of all EC classes). AnEnPi is of considerable value in the construction of initial datasets that can be further curated, particularly in gene and genome annotation, in studies involving molecular evolution and metabolism and in the identification of new potential drug targets. AnEnPi is an efficient tool for detection and annotation of analogous enzymes and other enzymes in whole genomes. It is available for academic use at: http://bioinfo.pdtis.fiocruz.br/AnEnPi/
1 Comparison of internal and total optical aberrations for 2 aberrometers: iTrace and OPD scan. To compare and evaluate the total and internal aberrations measured by two aberrometers: the laser ray tracing aberrometer (iTrace, Tracey Technology) and the automatic retinoscope aberrometer (OPD Scan, Nidek). A total of 54 healthy eyes were enrolled in the study. Following pupil dilation, aberrations were measured with the iTrace and OPD Scan. We compared the aberrations obtained from measurements obtained at pupillary diameters of 4 mm and 6 mm with the OPD Scan and iTrace. Aberrations of internal optics and total aberrations were compared for the two aberrometers. For each aberrometer and each eye, the averaged Zernike data were used to calculate various root-mean-square (RMS) data. These parameters, together with the refractive parameters, were then analyzed and complimented by paired t-tests. At a pupil diameter of 4 mm, the number of total aberrations in the entire eye showed significant differences for the mean values of spherical aberrations (Z4,0) obtained with the OPD Scan and iTrace aberrometers (p=0.001). Aberrations of the internal optics showed significant differences in the mean values of total RMS, coma (Z3,-1), and trefoil (Z3,3) between the iTrace and OPD Scan (p<0.001, p=0.01, p<0.001) for the same pupil diameter of 4 mm. At a pupil diameter of 6 mm, the two instruments showed a similar number of total aberrations. Aberrations of the internal optics showed significant differences in the mean values of total RMS, spherical aberration (Z4,0), and coma (Z3,-1) between the two devices (p<0.001, p=0.01, p<0.001). The iTrace and OPD Scan showed the largest number of differences for aberrations of internal optics rather than total aberrations for both pupil diameters. These results suggest that in healthy eyes, the two aberrometers may vary in some details. The aberrometers showed more agreement at a pupil diameter of 6 mm compared to 4 mm.
3 Unusual Cryptosporidium genotypes in human cases of diarrhea. Several Cryptosporidium spp. are known to infect humans, but most cases of illness are caused by Cryptosporidium hominis or C. parvum. During a long-term genotyping in the United Kingdom, we identified 3 unusual Cryptosporidium genotypes (skunk, horse, and rabbit) in human patients with diarrhea.
0 Simultaneous tracking of fly movement and gene expression using GFP. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is used extensively as a reporter for transgene expression in Drosophila and other organisms. However, GFP has not generally been used as a reporter for circadian patterns of gene expression, and it has not previously been possible to correlate patterns of reporter expression with 3D movement and behavior of transgenic animals. We present a video tracking system that allows tissue-specific GFP expression to be quantified and correlated with 3D animal movement in real time. eyeless/Pax6 reporter expression had a 12 hr period that correlated with fly activity levels. hsp70 and hsp22 gene reporters were induced during fly aging in circadian patterns (24 hr and 18 hr periods, respectively), and spiked in the hours preceding and overlapping the death of the animal. The phase of hsp gene reporter expression relative to fly activity levels was different for each fly, and remained the same throughout the life span. These experiments demonstrate that GFP can readily be used to assay longitudinally fly movement and tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. The hsp22-GFP and hsp70-GFP expression patterns were found to reflect accurately the endogenous gene expression patterns, including induction during aging and circadian periodicity. The combination of these new tracking methods with the hsp-GFP reporters revealed additional information, including a spike in hsp22 and hsp70 reporter expression preceding death, and an intriguing fly-to-fly variability in the phase of hsp70 and hsp22 reporter expression patterns. These methods allow specific temporal patterns of gene expression to be correlated with temporal patterns of animal activity, behavior and mortality.
2 Embolization of a bleeding maxillary arteriovenous malformation via the superficial temporal artery after external carotid artery ligation. We report a new approach of embolization in a 15-year-old boy that presented with a massive hemorrhage from a maxillary arteriovenous malformation. Re-bleeding occurred after emergent ligation of the external carotid artery. The bleeding was successfully controlled by embolization via the superficial temporal artery.
2 The association of anisakiasis in the ascending colon with sigmoid colon cancer: CT colonography findings. The association of anisakiasis of the colon with colon cancer is rare and difficult to diagnose. Only one case of this type has been reported to date. In this study, we report a case of synchronous colon cancer and colonic anisakiasis. A 50-year-old woman was admitted for abdominal pain, and a volume-rendered surface-shaded image of CT colonography (CTC) revealed a concentric narrowing in the sigmoid colon and a segmental fold thickening in the ascending colon. A total colectomy was performed and the diagnosis of synchronous sigmoid colon cancer and anisakiasis of the ascending colon was confirmed. This case is the first reported visualization of synchronous colon cancer and colonic anisakiasis on a CTC.
1 Intraductal tubular carcinoma of the pancreas: a case report with the imaging findings. We describe here a case of intraductal tubular carcinoma of the main pancreatic duct. Gadolinium-enhanced pancreas magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed an enhancing mass that was confined in the dilated main pancreatic duct of the pancreatic body, along with dilatation of the upstream main pancreatic duct and chronic pancreatitis that was due to obstruction. MR cholangiopancreatography and an endoscopic retrograde pancreatogram showed a filling defect that was due to an intraductal mass of the pancreatic body, along with dilatation of the upstream main pancreatic duct and no dilatation of the downstream main pancreatic duct. The pathological findings demonstrated an intraductal nodular appearance without papillary projection or mucin hypersecretion.
1 Fatal peripheral candidal suppurative thrombophlebitis in a postoperative patient. We report a case of fatal fungal peripheral suppurative thrombophlebitis, caused by Candida albicans, which was disseminated to the blood, lungs, eyes, and spine. Clinical suspicion and aggressive management are important in managing fungal peripheral suppurative thrombophlebitis. Early clinical suspicion is important in managing fungal peripheral suppurative thrombophlebitis, and radical excision of the affected veins, recognition of metastatic foci, and use of systemic antifungal agents are essential to avoid septic shock and death.
3 Epithelial ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 regulate the egression of human T cells across the bronchial epithelium. Egression of inflammatory cells from the lung interstitium into the airway lumen is critical for the resolution of inflammation, but the underlying mechanisms of this egression are unclear. Here, we use an in vitro system, in which human T cells migrate across a bronchial epithelial monolayer, to investigate the molecules involved. We show that although inhibition of T-cell LFA-1 blocks egression by 75 +/- 5.6% (P<0.0001), inhibition of the LFA-1-ligand ICAM-1 on the epithelium only inhibits by 52.7 +/- 0.06% (P=0.0001). We, therefore, looked for other epithelial ligands for LFA-1 and demonstrate that ICAM-2, but not ICAM-3, is expressed on the bronchial epithelium. Blocking ICAM-2 inhibits egression by 50.95 +/- 10.79% (P=0.04), and blocking both ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 inhibits egression by 69.6 +/- 5.2% (P< 0.0001). Inhibition of LFA-1/ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 interactions on the basolateral epithelium does not prevent egressing T cells from adhering, polarizing, or moving over the basal epithelium, but it does prevent their recognition of the interepithelial junctions. In conclusion, we show that egression of T cells involves three distinct sequential steps: adhesion, junctional recognition, and diapedesis; we further demonstrate that ICAM-2 is expressed on the bronchial epithelium and, together with ICAM-1, has an essential function in the clearance of T cells from the lung.
3 Leiomyosarcoma of the ovarian vein: a case report with radiological findings. Leiomyosarcomas of the ovarian vein are very rare. Four cases have been reported in the English language clinical literature. We present a case of leiomyosarcomas where the use of multi-detector CT had a substantial role in the establishment of the preoperative diagnosis. The radiological images as well as intraoperative features are illustrated. We also discuss the radiological findings of the ovarian vein leiomyosarcoma in comparison with those of other venous or retroperitoneal leiomyosarcomas. We expect that the use of multi-detector CT will be the choice for the diagnostic work-up of vascular leiomyosarcomas.
0 YKL-40, a marker of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, is elevated in patients with type 1 diabetes and increases with levels of albuminuria. The inflammation marker YKL-40 is elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes and is associated with atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular mortality. In the present study, YKL-40 levels were examined in patients with type 1 diabetes with increasing levels of albuminuria, known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. A total of 149 patients with type 1 diabetes attending Steno Diabetes Center were examined: 58 had normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion rate <30 mg/24 h), 46 had persistent microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion rate 30-300 mg/24 h), and 45 had persistent macroalbuminuria/diabetic nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion rate >300 mg/24 h). The control group consisted of 55 healthy individuals. Groups were matched according to sex and duration of diabetes (>30 years). Median levels [interquartile range] of serum YKL-40 were significantly higher in normoalbuminuria versus control (37 [29-52] vs. 53 [32-105] ng/ml, P < 0.01) and were increasing with increasing levels of albuminuria (microalbuminuria 74 [45-160] ng/ml and diabetic nephropathy 117 [68-215] ng/ml; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). YKL-40 levels correlated with the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the total group of participants (r2 = 0.25, P < 0.001). Significant but weak intercorrelations of YKL-40 were found with age, diastolic blood pressure, A1C, and serum creatinine. After adjustment for significant covariates, albuminuria was significantly associated with YKL-40 levels (P < 0.001). YKL-40 levels are elevated in patients with type 1 diabetes with an independent association between increasing YKL-40 levels and increasing levels of albuminuria. The present study is the first to suggest a role of YKL-40 in the gradually progressing vascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes.
1 Band 3 Courcouronnes (Ser667Phe): a trafficking mutant differentially rescued by wild-type band 3 and glycophorin A. We describe a mutation in human erythrocyte band 3 (anion exchanger 1; SLC4A1) causing both hereditary spherocytosis and distal renal tubular acidosis. The proband developed a transfusion-dependent, hemolytic anemia following birth. Immunoblotting showed band 3 was reduced to approximately 35% of wildtype; other proteins of the band 3/Rh macrocomplex were also reduced. DNA sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous mutation, c.2000C>T, leading to the amino acid substitution Ser667Phe. The parents were heterozygous for the same mutation. Sulfate influx in the patient's erythrocytes was approximately 40% wild type. The mutant band 3 produced very little chloride influx when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Influx was partially rescued by coexpression of glycophorin A and also rescued by coexpression of wild-type band 3. At 2 years of age, an ammonium chloride challenge showed the child has incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). Stable expression of mutant kidney band 3 in both nonpolarized and polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells showed that most of the mutant protein was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Overall our results suggest that the Ser667Phe does not affect the anion transport function of band 3, but causes a trafficking defect in both erythrocytes and kidney cells.
3 (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate reduces platelet-derived growth factor-BB-stimulated interleukin-6 synthesis in osteoblasts: suppression of SAPK/JNK. We previously showed that the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily, p44/p42 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal (JNK), positively plays a part in the platelet-derived growth factor-BB- (PDGF-BB-) stimulated synthesis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a potent bone resorptive agent, in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells while Akt and p70 S6 kinase negatively regulates the synthesis. In the present study, we investigated whether (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), one of the major green tea flavonoids, affects the synthesis of IL-6 in these cells and the mechanism. EGCG significantly reduced the IL-6 synthesis and IL-6 mRNA expression stimulated by PDGF-BB, EGCG reduced the PDGF-BB-stimulated IL-6 synthesis also in primary-cultured osteoblasts. EGCG had no effect on the levels of osteocalcin and osteoprotegerin in MC3T3-E1 cells. The PDGF-BB-induced autophosphorylation of PDGF receptor beta was not suppressed by EGCG. The PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase was not affected by EGCG. On the other hand, EGCG markedly suppressed the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. Finally, the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of Akt and p70 S6 kinase was not affected by EGCG. These results strongly suggest that EGCG inhibits the PDGF-BB-stimulated synthesis of IL-6 via suppression of SAPK/JNK pathway in osteoblasts.
1 Combining gene expression, demographic and clinical data in modeling disease: a case study of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This paper presents a retrospective statistical study on the newly-released data set by the Stanley Neuropathology Consortium on gene expression in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. This data set contains gene expression data as well as limited demographic and clinical data for each subject. Previous studies using statistical classification or machine learning algorithms have focused on gene expression data only. The present paper investigates if such techniques can benefit from including demographic and clinical data. We compare six classification algorithms: support vector machines (SVMs), nearest shrunken centroids, decision trees, ensemble of voters, naïve Bayes, and nearest neighbor. SVMs outperform the other algorithms. Using expression data only, they yield an area under the ROC curve of 0.92 for bipolar disorder versus control, and 0.91 for schizophrenia versus control. By including demographic and clinical data, classification performance improves to 0.97 and 0.94 respectively. This paper demonstrates that SVMs can distinguish bipolar disorder and schizophrenia from normal control at a very high rate. Moreover, it shows that classification performance improves by including demographic and clinical data. We also found that some variables in this data set, such as alcohol and drug use, are strongly associated to the diseases. These variables may affect gene expression and make it more difficult to identify genes that are directly associated to the diseases. Stratification can correct for such variables, but we show that this reduces the power of the statistical methods.
1 MUC16 expression in Sjogren's syndrome, KCS, and control subjects. To investigate the expression of MUC16 protein in tears and conjunctival cell membranes and MUC16 mRNA in conjunctival cells of Sjogren's syndrome (SS), keratoconjunctivitus sicca (KCS) and non-dry eyed (NDE) subjects. The relationship of tear flow and soluble MUC16 concentration was also measured. Seventy-six subjects were recruited for this study: 25 SS (confirmed via American-European Consensus Criteria 2002), 25 KCS (confirmed by symptoms and Schirmer scores < or =10 mm) and 26 NDE. Tear flow was measured by the Schirmer test without anesthesia for 5 min. Tears were collected using an eye-wash technique. Protein and mRNA were isolated from conjunctival epithelial cells collected via impression cytology. Soluble and membrane bound MUC16 were quantified via western blotting and MUC16 mRNA was quantified by real time qPCR. The SS group demonstrated significantly higher concentrations of soluble MUC16 (7.28 [SS] +/- 3.97 versus 3.35 [KCS] +/- 4.54 [p=0.004] and versus 1.61 [NDE] +/- 1.22 [p<0.001]) and MUC16 mRNA (4.66 [SS] +/- 5.06 versus 1.84 [KCS] +/- 2.26 [p=0.01] and 1.52 [NDE] +/- 1.04 [p=0.003]) compared to both KCS and NDE groups, respectively. No differences in soluble MUC16 or MUC16 mRNA were found between the KCS and NDE groups. Membrane bound MUC16 was similar in all three groups. No significant correlation was found between mean Schirmer values and any measure of MUC16 expression. These results demonstrate that SS subjects display a significant increase in both soluble MUC16 and MUC16 mRNA concentrations compared to other forms of aqueous deficient dry eye and non dry-eyed individuals. There was no correlation between tear flow and soluble MUC16 concentration.
0 Impaired nuclear Nrf2 translocation undermines the oxidative stress response in Friedreich ataxia. Friedreich ataxia originates from a decrease in mitochondrial frataxin, which causes the death of a subset of neurons. The biochemical hallmarks of the disease include low activity of the iron sulfur cluster-containing proteins (ISP) and impairment of antioxidant defense mechanisms that may play a major role in disease progression. We thus investigated signaling pathways involved in antioxidant defense mechanisms. We showed that cultured fibroblasts from patients with Friedreich ataxia exhibited hypersensitivity to oxidative insults because of an impairment in the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which led to faulty induction of antioxidant enzymes. This impairment originated from previously reported actin remodeling by hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the defective machinery for ISP synthesis by causing mitochondrial iron dysmetabolism increases hydrogen peroxide production that accounts for the increased susceptibility to oxidative stress.
3 MR imaging of the internal auditory canal and inner ear at 3T: comparison between 3D driven equilibrium and 3D balanced fast field echo sequences. To compare the use of 3D driven equilibrium (DRIVE) imaging with 3D balanced fast field echo (bFFE) imaging in the assessment of the anatomic structures of the internal auditory canal (IAC) and inner ear at 3 Tesla (T). Thirty ears of 15 subjects (7 men and 8 women; age range, 22-71 years; average age, 50 years) without evidence of ear problems were examined on a whole-body 3T MR scanner with both 3D DRIVE and 3D bFFE sequences by using an 8-channel sensitivity encoding (SENSE) head coil. Two neuroradiologists reviewed both MR images with particular attention to the visibility of the anatomic structures, including four branches of the cranial nerves within the IAC, anatomic structures of the cochlea, vestibule, and three semicircular canals. Although both techniques provided images of relatively good quality, the 3D DRIVE sequence was somewhat superior to the 3D bFFE sequence. The discrepancies were more prominent for the basal turn of the cochlea, vestibule, and all semicircular canals, and were thought to be attributed to the presence of greater magnetic susceptibility artifacts inherent to gradient-echo techniques such as bFFE. Because of higher image quality and less susceptibility artifacts, we highly recommend the employment of 3D DRIVE imaging as the MR imaging choice for the IAC and inner ear.
0 IL-1beta, IL-6, and RANTES as biomarkers of Chikungunya severity. Little is known about the immunopathogenesis of Chikungunya virus. Circulating levels of immune mediators and growth factors were analyzed from patients infected during the first Singaporean Chikungunya fever outbreak in early 2008 to establish biomarkers associated with infection and/or disease severity. Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed Chikungunya fever infection, who were referred to the Communicable Disease Centre/Tan Tock Seng Hospital during the period from January to February 2008, were included in this retrospective study. Plasma fractions were analyzed using a multiplex-microbead immunoassay. Among the patients, the most common clinical features were fever (100%), arthralgia (90%), rash (50%) and conjunctivitis (40%). Profiles of 30 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were able to discriminate the clinical forms of Chikungunya from healthy controls, with patients classified as non-severe and severe disease. Levels of 8 plasma cytokines and 4 growth factors were significantly elevated. Statistical analysis showed that an increase in IL-1beta, IL-6 and a decrease in RANTES were associated with disease severity. This is the first comprehensive report on the production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors during acute Chikungunya virus infection. Using these biomarkers, we were able to distinguish between mild disease and more severe forms of Chikungunya fever, thus enabling the identification of patients with poor prognosis and monitoring of the disease.
2 Effect of base curve radius of therapeutic lenses on epithelial healing after laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy. To determine the effect of the base curve radius (BCR) of therapeutic soft contact lens (T-lens) on epithelial healing after laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK). Ninety-two eyes in 47 patients with myopia were prospectively evaluated after LASEK. All the patients wore T-lenses with the BCR (R1) randomly chosen after LASEK. The T-lenses were removed after complete healing of the epithelial wounds. We calculated an estimated BCR (R2) from postoperative topography using a diopter conversion table. The patients were divided into two groups according to the differences between the BCR (R1) and the estimated BCR (R2). The flat fitting group was R1 > R2 (Group A), and the steep fitting group was R1<R2 (Group B). Patient's age, epithelial healing time, ablation amount, and BCR were compared between these two groups. Group A (R1>R2) had 53 eyes, and Group B (R1<R2) had 39 eyes. Group A showed a shorter epithelial healing time than Group B (5.8+/-1.7 days vs. 6.7+/-2.1 days, p=0.04). The flat fitting group showed a shorter epithelial healing time than the steep fitting group after LASEK.
3 Impact of the Spanish smoking law on exposure to second-hand smoke and respiratory health in hospitality workers: a cohort study. A smoke-free law came into effect in Spain on 1st January 2006, affecting all enclosed workplaces except hospitality venues, whose proprietors can choose among totally a smoke-free policy, a partial restriction with designated smoking areas, or no restriction on smoking on the premises. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the law among hospitality workers by assessing second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure and the frequency of respiratory symptoms before and one year after the ban. We formed a baseline cohort of 431 hospitality workers in Spain and 45 workers in Portugal and Andorra. Of them, 318 (66.8%) were successfully followed up 12 months after the ban, and 137 nonsmokers were included in this analysis. We obtained self-reported exposure to SHS and the presence of respiratory symptoms, and collected saliva samples for cotinine measurement. Salivary cotinine decreased by 55.6% after the ban among nonsmoker workers in venues where smoking was totally prohibited (from median of 1.6 ng/ml before to 0.5 ng/ml, p<0.01). Cotinine concentration decreased by 27.6% (p = 0.068) among workers in venues with designated smoking areas, and by 10.7% (p = 0.475) among workers in venues where smoking was allowed. In Portugal and Andorra, no differences between cotinine concentration were found before (1.2 ng/ml) and after the ban (1.2 ng/ml). In Spain, reported respiratory symptom declined significantly (by 71.9%; p<0.05) among workers in venues that became smoke-free. After adjustment for potential confounders, salivary cotinine and respiratory symptoms decreased significantly among workers in Spanish hospitality venues where smoking was totally banned. Among nonsmoker hospitality workers in bars and restaurants where smoking was allowed, exposure to SHS after the ban remained similar to pre-law levels. The partial restrictions on smoking in Spanish hospitality venues do not sufficiently protect hospitality workers against SHS or its consequences for respiratory health.
1 Spatial patterns of natural hazards mortality in the United States. Studies on natural hazard mortality are most often hazard-specific (e.g. floods, earthquakes, heat), event specific (e.g. Hurricane Katrina), or lack adequate temporal or geographic coverage. This makes it difficult to assess mortality from natural hazards in any systematic way. This paper examines the spatial patterns of natural hazard mortality at the county-level for the U.S. from 1970-2004 using a combination of geographical and epidemiological methods. Chronic everyday hazards such as severe weather (summer and winter) and heat account for the majority of natural hazard fatalities. The regions most prone to deaths from natural hazards are the South and intermountain west, but sub-regional county-level mortality patterns show more variability. There is a distinct urban/rural component to the county patterns as well as a coastal trend. Significant clusters of high mortality are in the lower Mississippi Valley, upper Great Plains, and Mountain West, with additional areas in west Texas, and the panhandle of Florida, Significant clusters of low mortality are in the Midwest and urbanized Northeast. There is no consistent source of hazard mortality data, yet improvements in existing databases can produce quality data that can be incorporated into spatial epidemiological studies as demonstrated in this paper. It is important to view natural hazard mortality through a geographic lens so as to better inform the public living in such hazard prone areas, but more importantly to inform local emergency practitioners who must plan for and respond to disasters in their community.
2 Sensitive and specific detection of the non-human sialic Acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid in human tissues and biotherapeutic products. Humans are genetically defective in synthesizing the common mammalian sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), but can metabolically incorporate it from dietary sources (particularly red meat and milk) into glycoproteins and glycolipids of human tumors, fetuses and some normal tissues. Metabolic incorporation of Neu5Gc from animal-derived cells and medium components also results in variable contamination of molecules and cells intended for human therapies. These Neu5Gc-incorporation phenomena are practically significant, because normal humans can have high levels of circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Thus, there is need for the sensitive and specific detection of Neu5Gc in human tissues and biotherapeutic products. Unlike monoclonal antibodies that recognize Neu5Gc only in the context of underlying structures, chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY) polyclonal antibodies can recognize Neu5Gc in broader contexts. However, prior preparations of such antibodies (including our own) suffered from some non-specificity, as well as some cross-reactivity with the human sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). We have developed a novel affinity method utilizing sequential columns of immobilized human and chimpanzee serum sialoglycoproteins, followed by specific elution from the latter column by free Neu5Gc. The resulting mono-specific antibody shows no staining in tissues or cells from mice with a human-like defect in Neu5Gc production. It allows sensitive and specific detection of Neu5Gc in all underlying glycan structural contexts studied, and is applicable to immunohistochemical, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot and flow cytometry analyses. Non-immune chicken IgY is used as a reliable negative control. We show that these approaches allow sensitive detection of Neu5Gc in human tissue samples and in some biotherapeutic products, and finally show an example of how Neu5Gc might be eliminated from such products, by using a human cell line grown under defined conditions. We report a reliable antibody-based method for highly sensitive and specific detection of the non-human sialic acid Neu5Gc in human tissues and biotherapeutic products that has not been previously described.
1 Pure and mixed tubular carcinoma of the breast: mammographic and sonographic differential features. We wanted to evaluate the mammographic and sonographic differential features between pure (PT) and mixed tubular carcinoma (MT) of the breast. Between January 1998 and May 2004, 17 PTs and 14 MTs were pathologically confirmed at our institution. The preoperative mammography (n = 26) and sonography (n = 28) were analyzed by three radiologists according to BI-RADS. On mammography, a mass was not detected in eight patients with PT and in one patient with MT (57% vs. 8%, respectively, p = 0.021), which was statistically different. The other findings on mammography and sonography showed no statistical differences between the PT and MT, although the numerical values were different. When the lesions were detected mammographically, an irregularly shaped mass with a spiculated margin was more frequently found in the MT than in the PT (100% vs. 83%, respectively, p = 0.353). On sonography, all 28 patients presented with a mass and most lesions showed as not being circumscribed, hypoechoic masses with an echogenic halo. Surrounding tissue changes and posterior shadowing were more frequently found in the MT than in the PT (75% vs. 50%, respectively, p = 0.253, 58% vs. 19%, respectively, p = 1.000). An oval shaped mass was more frequently found in the PT than in the MT (44% vs. 25%, respectively; p = 0.434). PT and MT cannot be precisely differentiated on mammography and sonography. However, the absence of a mass on mammography or the presence of an oval shaped mass would favor the diagnosis of PT. An irregularly shaped mass with surrounding tissue change and posterior shadowing on sonography would favor the diagnosis of MT and also a less favorable prognosis.
2 Malaria treatment-seeking behaviour and recovery from malaria in a highland area of Kenya. Malaria epidemics in highland areas of Kenya cause significant morbidity and mortality. To assess treatment-seeking behaviour for malaria in these areas, a questionnaire was administered to 117 randomly selected households in the highland area of Kipsamoite, Kenya. Self-reported episodes of malaria occurred in 100 adults and 66 children. The most frequent initial sources of treatment for malaria in adults and children were medical facilities (66.0% and 66.7%) and local shops (19.0% and 30.3%). Adults and children who initially visited a medical facility for treatment were significantly more likely to recover and require no further treatment than those who initially went to a local shop (adults, 84.9% v. 36.8%, P < 0.0001, and children, 79.6% v. 40.0%, P = 0.002, respectively). Individuals who attended medical facilities recalled receiving anti-malarial medication significantly more frequently than those who visited shops (adults, 100% vs. 29.4%, and children, 100% v. 5.0%, respectively, both P < 0.0001). A significant proportion of this highland population chooses local shops for initial malaria treatment and receives inappropriate medication at these localshops, reslting in delay of effective treatment. Shopkeeper education has the potential to be a component of prevention or containment strategies for malaria epidemics in highland areas.
3 Detection of Balamuthia mandrillaris DNA by real-time PCR targeting the RNase P gene. The free-living amoeba Balamuthia mandrillaris may cause fatal encephalitis both in immunocompromised and in - apparently - immunocompetent humans and other mammalian species. Rapid, specific, sensitive, and reliable detection requiring little pathogen-specific expertise is an absolute prerequisite for a successful therapy and a welcome tool for both experimental and epidemiological research. A real-time polymerase chain reaction assay using TaqMan probes (real-time PCR) was established specifically targeting the RNase P gene of B. mandrillaris amoebae. The assay detected at least 2 (down to 0.5) genomes of B. mandrillaris grown in axenic culture. It did not react with DNA from closely related Acanthamoeba (3 species), nor with DNA from Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania major, Pneumocystis murina, Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), human brain, various mouse organs, or from human and murine cell lines. The assay efficiently detected B. mandrillaris DNA in spiked cell cultures, spiked murine organ homogenates, B. mandrillaris-infected mice, and CNS tissue-DNA preparations from 2 patients with proven cerebral balamuthiasis. This novel primer set was successfully combined with a published set that targets the B. mandrillaris 18S rRNA gene in a duplex real-time PCR assay to ensure maximum specificity and as a precaution against false negative results. A real-time PCR assay for B. mandrillaris amoebae is presented, that is highly specific, sensitive, and reliable and thus suited both for diagnosis and for research.
0 Blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose rather than metabolic syndrome predict coronary artery calcium progression: the Rancho Bernardo Study. To examine the association of the metabolic syndrome, defined by World Health Organization (WHO) and Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) criteria, and its components with coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. Participants were 338 older community-dwelling men and women without known heart disease who had measurements of heart disease risk factors and CAC at two clinic visits within an average interval of 4.5 years. Progression was defined as an increase in total CAC volume score > or =2.5 mm(3). At baseline, mean age was 67.6 years; metabolic syndrome was present in 15.1% by WHO criteria and in 11.8% by ATP-III criteria, and 5.3% met both criteria. Participants with WHO-defined metabolic syndrome had a greater change in total CAC volume score than those without (P = 0.001). There was no significant difference in CAC volume change by ATP-III-defined metabolic syndrome status (P = 0.69). Overall, 46.4% of participants were CAC progressors. In logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and LDL cholesterol, neither WHO-nor ATP-III-defined metabolic syndrome predicted CAC progression. Among metabolic syndrome components, only hypertension was independently associated with CAC progression (odds ratio 2.11 [95% CI 1.33-3.3], P = 0.002). Fasting blood glucose (>100 mg/dl) was an independent predictor of CAC progression, but only for the 118 participants younger than age 65 years (2.3 [1.01-5.5], P = 0.04). In older adults without known heart disease, blood pressure levels and fasting plasma glucose were better independent determinants of CAC progression than metabolic syndrome itself.
1 Unsupervised reduction of random noise in complex data by a row-specific, sorted principal component-guided method. Large biological data sets, such as expression profiles, benefit from reduction of random noise. Principal component (PC) analysis has been used for this purpose, but it tends to remove small features as well as random noise. We interpreted the PCs as a mere signal-rich coordinate system and sorted the squared PC-coordinates of each row in descending order. The sorted squared PC-coordinates were compared with the distribution of the ordered squared random noise, and PC-coordinates for insignificant contributions were treated as random noise and nullified. The processed data were transformed back to the initial coordinates as noise-reduced data. To increase the sensitivity of signal capture and reduce the effects of stochastic noise, this procedure was applied to multiple small subsets of rows randomly sampled from a large data set, and the results corresponding to each row of the data set from multiple subsets were averaged. We call this procedure Row-specific, Sorted PRincipal component-guided Noise Reduction (RSPR-NR). Robust performance of RSPR-NR, measured by noise reduction and retention of small features, was demonstrated using simulated data sets. Furthermore, when applied to an actual expression profile data set, RSPR-NR preferentially increased the correlations between genes that share the same Gene Ontology terms, strongly suggesting reduction of random noise in the data set. RSPR-NR is a robust random noise reduction method that retains small features well. It should be useful in improving the quality of large biological data sets.
0 Sexual abstinence behavior among never-married youths in a generalized HIV epidemic country: evidence from the 2005 Côte d'Ivoire AIDS indicator survey. Sexual abstinence is the best available option for preventing both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. Identifying the factors associated with sexual abstinence among youths would have meaningful implications in a generalized HIV epidemic country such as the Côte d'Ivoire. Thus, we explored sexual abstinence behavior among never-married individuals aged 15 to 24 in Côte d'Ivoire and assessed factors that predict sexual abstinence. We obtained data from the nationally representative and population-based 2005 Côte d'Ivoire AIDS Indicator Survey, conducted from September 2004 to October 2005. Our sample included 3041 never-married people aged 15 to 24. Of these, 990 reported never having sexual intercourse (primary abstinence) and 137 reported sexual experience but not in the 12 months prior to the survey (secondary abstinence). In all, 1127 youths reported sexual abstinence practice. Of the 3041 never-married youths, 54.4% were male and 45.6% were female. About 33.0%, 6.7%, and 37.1% of them were practicing primary, secondary, and sexual abstinence behavior, respectively. Females of higher education level were significantly 11.14 times as likely as those of no education to practice either primary or secondary abstinence. Males who were animists, had no religion, or were practicing religions other than Christianity or Muslim were significantly less likely than other male youths to practice sexual abstinence (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.30-0.95). Living in the north-west region of the country significantly decreased the odds of sexual abstinence among female youths. Similarly, female youths living in rural areas were significantly 0.42 times as likely as those in the urban zones to practice sexual abstinence. HIV/AIDS prevention program components could include media campaigns, educational intervention improvement, as well as promoting policies that shape female youth livelihoods. Likewise, youth involvement in initiatives to design appropriate messages, and activities to promote positive behaviors or to change negative perceptions could impact on youths' decision to exert abstinence behavior.
1 Accuracy of self-reported body weight, height and waist circumference in a Dutch overweight working population. In population studies, body mass index (BMI) is generally calculated from self-reported body weight and height. The self-report of these anthropometrics is known to be biased, resulting in a misclassification of BMI status. The aim of our study is to evaluate the accuracy of self-reported weight, height and waist circumference among a Dutch overweight (Body Mass Index [BMI] > or = 25 kg/m2) working population, and to determine to what extent the accuracy was moderated by sex, age, BMI, socio-economic status (SES) and health-related factors. Both measured and self-reported body weight and body height were collected in 1298 healthy overweight employees (66.6% male; mean age 43.9 +/- 8.6 years; mean BMI 29.5 +/- 3.4 kg/m2), taking part in the ALIFE@Work project. Measured and self-reported waist circumferences (WC) were available for a sub-group of 250 overweight subjects (70.4% male; mean age 44.1 +/- 9.2 years; mean BMI 29.6 +/- 3.0 kg/m2). Intra Class Correlation (ICC), Cohen's kappa and Bland Altman plots were used for reliability analyses, while linear regression analyses were performed to assess the factors that were (independently) associated with the reliability. Body weight was significantly (p < 0.001) under-reported on average by 1.4 kg and height significantly (p < 0.001) over-reported by 0.7 cm. Consequently, BMI was significantly (p < 0.001) under-reported by 0.7 kg/m2. WC was significantly (p < 0.001) over-reported by 1.1 cm. Although the self-reporting of anthropometrics was biased, ICC's showed high concordance between measured and self-reported values. Also, substantial agreement existed between the prevalences of BMI status and increased WC based on measured and self-reported data. The under-reporting of BMI and body weight was significantly (p < 0.05) affected by measured weight, height, SES and smoking status, and the over-reporting of WC by age, sex and measured WC. Results suggest that self-reported BMI and WC are satisfactorily accurate for the assessment of the prevalence of overweight/obesity and increased WC in a middle-aged overweight working population. As the accuracy of self-reported anthropometrics is affected by measured weight, height, WC, smoking status and/or SES, results for these subgroups should be interpreted with caution. Due to the large power of our study, the clinical significance of our statistical significant findings may be limited. ISRCTN04265725.
2 Synergistic effect of the combination of nanoparticulate Fe3O4 and Au with daunomycin on K562/A02 cells. In this study, we have explored the possibility of the combination of the high reactivity of nano Fe3O4 or Au nanoparticles and daunomycin, one of the most important antitumor drugs in the treatment of acute leukemia clinically, to inhibit MDR of K562/A02 cells. Initially, to determine whether the magnetic nanoparticle Fe3O4 and Au can facilitate the anticancer drug to reverse the resistance of cancer cells, we have explored the cytotoxic effect of daunomycin (DNR) with and without the magnetic nano-Fe3O4 or nano-Au on K562 and K562/A02 cells by MTT assay. Besides, the intracellular DNR concentration and apoptosis of the K562/A02 cells was further investigated by flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscopic studies. The MDR1 gene expression of the K562/A02 cells was also studied by RT-PCR method. Our results indicate that 5.0 x 10(-7) M nano-Fe3O4 or 2.0 x 10(-8) M nano-Au is biocompatible and can apparently raise the intracellular DNR accumulation of the K562/A02 cells and increase the apoptosis of tumor cells. Moreover, our observations illustrate that although these two kinds of nanoparticles themselves could not lower the MDRI gene expression of the K562/A02 cells, yet they could degrade the MDR1 gene level when combining with anticancer drug DNR. This raises the possibility to combine the nano-Fe3O4 or nano-Au with DNR to reverse the drug resistance of K562/A02 cells, which could offer a new strategy for the promising efficient chemotherapy of the leukemia patients.
1 Phthalates impair germ cell development in the human fetal testis in vitro without change in testosterone production. Several studies have described an increasing frequency of male reproductive disorders, which may have a common origin in fetal life and which are hypothesized to be caused by endocrine disruptors. Phthalate esters represent a class of environmental endocrine-active chemicals known to disrupt development of the male reproductive tract by decreasing testosterone production in the fetal rat. Using the organ culture system we developed previously, we investigated the effects on the development of human fetal testis of one phthalate--mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP)--an industrial chemical found in many products, which has been incriminated as a disruptor of male reproductive function. Human fetal testes were recovered during the first trimester (7-12 weeks) of gestation, a critical period for testicular differentiation, and cultured for 3 days with or without MEHP in basal conditions or stimulated with luteinizing hormone (LH). Whatever the dose, MEHP treatment had no effect on basal or LH-stimulated testosterone produced by the human fetal testis in vitro, although testosterone production can be modulated in our culture system. MEHP (10(-4) M) did not affect proliferation or apoptosis of Sertoli cells, but it reduced the mRNA expression of anti-Müllerian hormone. MEHP (10(-4) M) reduced the number of germ cells by increasing their apoptosis, measured by the detection of caspase-3-positive germ cells, without modification of their proliferation. This is the first experimental demonstration that phthalates alter the development of the germ cell lineage in humans. However, in contrast to results observed in the rat, phthalates did not affect steroidogenesis.
3 The epidemiology of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Canada: a review of mortality data. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and particularly its transmissibility through blood and blood products, has become a focus of concern in Canada. The recent identification of new variant CJD led to a review of the Canadian mortality database to identify any clustering of CJD by age, sex, or geographic location.
0 Does the pain-protective GTP cyclohydrolase haplotype significantly alter the pattern or severity of pain in humans with chronic pancreatitis? Pain is often a dominant clinical feature of chronic pancreatitis but the frequency and severity is highly variable between subjects. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms contribute to variations in clinical pain patterns. Since genetic variations in the GTP cyclohydrolase (GCH1) gene have been reported to protect some patients from pain, we investigated the effect of the "pain protective haplotype" in well characterized patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) or recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) from the North American Pancreatitis Study 2 (NAPS2). Subjects in the NAPS2 study were asked to rank their pain in one of 5 categories reflecting different levels of pain frequency and severity. All subjects were genotyped at rs8007267 and rs3783641 to determine the frequency of the GCH1 pain-protective haplotype. In Caucasian subjects the frequency of the pain-protective GCH1 haplotype was no different in the control group (n = 236), CP patients (n = 265), RAP patients (N = 131), or in CP patients subclassified by pain category compared to previously reported haplotype frequencies in the general Caucasian population. The GCH1 pain-protective haplotype does not have a significant effect on pain patterns or severity in RAP or CP. These results are important for helping to define the regulators of visceral pain, and to distinguish different mechanisms of pain.
0 Primary undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the left atrium that presented as acute pulmonary edema. A 37-year-old woman was admitted to Dong-A University Hospital for rapidly progressive congestive heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a large mass with a stalk that appeared to be a myxoma on the posterior wall of the left atrium. However, the histological diagnosis was undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. We report a case of primary undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the left atrium with acute pulmonary edema caused by mitral inflow obstruction.
3 PARP-1 ensures regulation of replication fork progression by homologous recombination on damaged DNA. Poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is activated by DNA damage and has been implicated in the repair of single-strand breaks (SSBs). Involvement of PARP-1 in other DNA damage responses remains controversial. In this study, we show that PARP-1 is required for replication fork slowing on damaged DNA. Fork progression in PARP-1(-/-) DT40 cells is not slowed down even in the presence of DNA damage induced by the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT). Mammalian cells treated with a PARP inhibitor or PARP-1-specific small interfering RNAs show similar results. The expression of human PARP-1 restores fork slowing in PARP-1(-/-) DT40 cells. PARP-1 affects SSB repair, homologous recombination (HR), and nonhomologous end joining; therefore, we analyzed the effect of CPT on DT40 clones deficient in these pathways. We find that fork slowing is correlated with the proficiency of HR-mediated repair. Our data support the presence of a novel checkpoint pathway in which the initiation of HR but not DNA damage delays the fork progression.
3 Coccidioidomycosis in New York State. Coccidioidomycosis, a systemic fungal disease caused by Coccidioides immitis, is endemic in the southwestern United States and in parts of Mexico and Central and South America. Only sporadic cases have been reported in areas (including New York) where the disease is not endemic. We used hospital discharge records and state mycology laboratory data to investigate the characteristics of C. immitis infections among New York State residents. From 1992 to 1997, 161 persons had hospital discharge diagnoses of coccidioidomycosis (ICD9 Code 114.0 - 114.5, 114.9). From 1989 to 1997, 49 cultures from patients were confirmed as C. immitis; 26 of these patients had traveled to disease-endemic areas. Fourteen of 16 isolates had multilocus genotypes similar to those of Arizona isolates, which corroborates the travel-related acquisition of the disease. Our results indicate that coccidioidomycosis may be more common in New York residents than previously recognized. Increased awareness among health-care providers should improve timely diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis and prevention of associated illnesses and deaths among patients in nondisease-endemic areas.
0 Protein functional surfaces: global shape matching and local spatial alignments of ligand binding sites. Protein surfaces comprise only a fraction of the total residues but are the most conserved functional features of proteins. Surfaces performing identical functions are found in proteins absent of any sequence or fold similarity. While biochemical activity can be attributed to a few key residues, the broader surrounding environment plays an equally important role. We describe a methodology that attempts to optimize two components, global shape and local physicochemical texture, for evaluating the similarity between a pair of surfaces. Surface shape similarity is assessed using a three-dimensional object recognition algorithm and physicochemical texture similarity is assessed through a spatial alignment of conserved residues between the surfaces. The comparisons are used in tandem to efficiently search the Global Protein Surface Survey (GPSS), a library of annotated surfaces derived from structures in the PDB, for studying evolutionary relationships and uncovering novel similarities between proteins. We provide an assessment of our method using library retrieval experiments for identifying functionally homologous surfaces binding different ligands, functionally diverse surfaces binding the same ligand, and binding surfaces of ubiquitous and conformationally flexible ligands. Results using surface similarity to predict function for proteins of unknown function are reported. Additionally, an automated analysis of the ATP binding surface landscape is presented to provide insight into the correlation between surface similarity and function for structures in the PDB and for the subset of protein kinases.
0 A case of more abundant and dysplastic adenomas in the interposed colon than in the native colon. We report a 60-year-old woman with intramucosal adenocarcinoma arising in the interposed colon, 40 years after the esophageal reconstruction for lye induced esophageal stricture. Although synchronous adenomas were also found in the native colon where the graft was taken, the number of adenomas was greater in the interposed colon and more dysplastic, even progressed to adenocarcinoma, than that of the native colon. The microsatellite instability-testing performed in the intramucosal carcinoma from interposed colon showed absence of microsatellite instability. Changing of location and functional demand of colonic segment, and the exposure to different intraluminal contents might have facilitated the adenoma- carcinoma transformation in the interposed colon.
3 Cell wall glycans and soluble factors determine the interactions between the hyphae of Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fungus, Candida albicans, and the bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are opportunistic human pathogens that have been coisolated from diverse body sites. Pseudomonas aeruginosa suppresses C. albicans proliferation in vitro and potentially in vivo but it is the C. albicans hyphae that are killed while yeast cells are not. We show that hyphal killing involves both contact-mediated and soluble factors. Bacterial culture filtrates contained heat-labile soluble factors that killed C. albicans hyphae. In cocultures, localized points of hyphal lysis were observed, suggesting that adhesion and subsequent bacteria-mediated cell wall lysis is involved in the killing of C. albicans hyphae. The glycosylation status of the C. albicans cell wall affected the rate of contact-dependent killing because mutants with severely truncated O-linked, but not N-linked, glycans were hypersensitive to Pseudomonas-mediated killing. Deletion of HWP1, ALS3 or HYR1, which encode major hypha-associated cell wall proteins, had no effect on fungal susceptibility.
3 The internally truncated LRP5 receptor presents a therapeutic target in breast cancer. Breast cancer is a common malignant disease, which may be caused by a number of genes deregulated by genomic or epigenomic events. Deregulated WNT/beta-catenin signaling with accumulation of beta-catenin is common in breast tumors, but mutations in WNT signaling pathway components have been rare. An aberrantly spliced internally truncated LRP5 receptor (LRP5Delta666-809, LRP5Delta) was shown recently to be resistant to DKK1 inhibition, and was required for beta-catenin accumulation in hyperparathyroid tumors and parathyroid tumor growth. Here we show, by reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis, that LRP5Delta is frequently expressed in breast tumors of different cancer stage (58-100%), including carcinoma in situ and metastatic carcinoma. LRP5Delta was required in MCF7 breast cancer cells for the non-phosphorylated active beta-catenin level, transcription activity of beta-catenin, cell growth in vitro, and breast tumor growth in a xenograft SCID mouse model. WNT3 ligand, but not WNT1 and WNT3A augmented the endogenous beta-catenin activity of MCF7 cells in a DKK1-insensitive manner. Furthermore, an anti-LRP5 antibody attenuated beta-catenin activity, inhibited cell growth, and induced apoptosis in LRP5Delta-positive MCF7 and T-47D breast cancer cells, but not in control cells. Our results suggest that the LRP5Delta receptor is strongly implicated in mammary gland tumorigenesis and that its aberrant expression present an early event during disease progression. LRP5 antibody therapy may have a significant role in the treatment of breast cancer.
3 Natural history of Sin Nombre virus in western Colorado. A mark-recapture longitudinal study of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to Sin Nombre virus (SNV) in rodent populations in western Colorado (1994-results summarized to October 1997) indicates the presence of SNV or a closely related hantavirus at two sites. Most rodents (principally deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, and pinyon mice, P. truei) did not persist on the trapping webs much beyond 1 month after first capture. Some persisted more than 1 year, which suggests that even a few infected deer mice could serve as transseasonal reservoirs and mechanisms for over-winter virus maintenance. A positive association between wounds and SNV antibody in adult animals at both sites suggests that when infected rodents in certain populations fight with uninfected rodents, virus amplification occurs. At both sites, male rodents comprised a larger percentage of seropositive mice than recaptured mice, which suggests that male mice contribute more to the SNV epizootic cycle than female mice. In deer mice, IgG antibody prevalence fluctuations were positively associated with population fluctuations. The rates of seroconversion, which in deer mice at both sites occurred mostly during late summer and midwinter, were higher than the seroprevalence, which suggests that the longer deer mice live, the greater the probability they will become infected with SNV.
1 Magnetic resonance imaging of transient left ventricular apical ballooning related to emotional stress: a case report. Transient left ventricular apical ballooning is characterized by transient wall motion abnormalities involving the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle in the absence of coronary arterial occlusion. A 66-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with chest pain that mimicked acute myocardial infarction. An aortogram showed akinesis from the mid to apical left ventricle with sparing of the basal segments. Four days later, she underwent MRI, which demonstrated characteristic apical contractile dysfunction, the same as the aortogram, without evidence of myocardial infarction on the MRI. Two weeks later, her symptoms were resolved and follow-up echocardiography showed normal ventricular function.
0 A Trivers-Willard effect in contemporary humans: male-biased sex ratios among billionaires. Natural selection should favour the ability of mothers to adjust the sex ratio of offspring in relation to the offspring's potential reproductive success. In polygynous species, mothers in good condition would be advantaged by giving birth to more sons. While studies on mammals in general provide support for the hypothesis, studies on humans provide particularly inconsistent results, possibly because the assumptions of the model do not apply. Here, we take a subset of humans in very good condition: the Forbe's billionaire list. First, we test if the assumptions of the model apply, and show that mothers leave more grandchildren through their sons than through their daughters. We then show that billionaires have 60% sons, which is significantly different from the general population, consistent with our hypothesis. However, women who themselves are billionaires have fewer sons than women having children with billionaires, suggesting that maternal testosterone does not explain the observed variation. Furthermore, paternal masculinity as indexed by achievement, could not explain the variation, since there was no variation in sex ratio between self-made or inherited billionaires. Humans in the highest economic bracket leave more grandchildren through sons than through daughters. Therefore, adaptive variation in sex ratios is expected, and human mothers in the highest economic bracket do give birth to more sons, suggesting similar sex ratio manipulation as seen in other mammals.
1 Generation of insulin-producing human mesenchymal stem cells using recombinant adeno-associated virus. The purpose of current experiment is the generation of insulin-producing human mesenchymal stem cells as therapeutic source for the cure of type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is generally caused by insulin deficiency accompanied by the destruction of islet beta-cells. In various trials for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, cell-based gene therapy using stem cells is considered as one of the most useful candidate for the treatment. In this experiment, human mesenchymal stem cells were transduced with AAV which is containing furin-cleavable human preproinsulin gene to generate insulin-producing cells as surrogate beta-cells for the type 1 diabetes therapy. In the rAAV production procedure, rAAV was generated by transfection of AD293 cells. Human mesenchymal stems cells were transduced using rAAV with a various multiplicity of infection. Transduction of recombinant AAV was also tested using beta-galactosidse expression. Cell viability was determined by using MTT assay to evaluate the toxicity of the transduction procedure. Expression and production of Insulin were tested using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry. Secretion of human insulin and C-peptide from the cells was assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Production of insulin and C-peptide from the test group represented a higher increase compared to the control group. In this study, we examined generation of insulin-producing cells from mesenchymal stem cells by genetic engineering for diabetes therapy. This work might be valuable to the field of tissue engineering for diabetes treatment.
2 Hormone-dependent aging problems in women. One of the major social issues nowadays is the aging society. Korea is already an aging society, and 63 cities and districts are ultra-aged societies where the rate of people older than 65 yr exceeds 20%. Among them, more than 67% are women. These statistics reveal the importance of healthcare for older women. Disease and disability of older women are very closely related to the loss of female sex hormones after menopause. Major hormone-dependent aging problems in women such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease (AD), urinary incontinence, and coronary atherosclerosis were surveyed in this review, and the key role of hormones in those diseases and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) were summarized. We expect that this review would provide some understanding of factors that must be considered to give optimal care to older women for healthy lives.
1 Evaluating the degree of conformity of papillary carcinoma and follicular carcinoma to the reported ultrasonographic findings of malignant thyroid tumor. We wanted to evaluate the degree of conformity of papillary carcinoma and follicular carcinoma to the reported ultrasonographic findings of malignant thyroid tumor. Between January 2003 and December 2004, fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed in 1,036 patients with palpable and nonpalpable thyroid lesions. We retrospectively reviewed the ultrasonographic findings of patients with papillary carcinomas (n = 127) and follicular carcinomas (n = 23) that were proven by operation or fine needle aspiration biopsy. We analyzed the ultrasonographic findings of these nodules based on the reported ultrasonographic findings of malignant thyroid tumor: hypoechogenicity, a taller than wide orientation, a microlobulated or irregular margin, a thick hypoechoic rim (halo sign), microcalcification and cystic change. The echogenicity was hypoechoic in 72.4% (92/127) of the papillary carcinomas, but it was isoechoic in 65.2% (15/23) of the follicular carcinomas (p < 0.001). The nodule shape was tall or round in 74.1% of the papillary carcinomas, but it was flat in 72.7% of the follicular carcinomas (p < 0.001). The tumor margin was microlobulated or irregular in 92.9% of the papillary carcinomas and in 60.9% of the follicular carcinomas (p < 0.001). A hypoechoic rim was seen in 26% of the papillary carcinomas (thin rim: 13.4%, thick rim: 12.6%) and in 86.6% of the follicular carcinomas (thin rim: 39.1%, thick rim: 47.8%, p < 0.001). Microcalcifications were demonstrated in 33.9% of the papillary carcinomas and in none of the cases of follicular carcinoma (p < 0.001). A solid mass without cystic change were seen in 98.4% of the papillary carcinomas and in 82.6% of the follicular carcinomas (p < 0.001). The previously reported ultrasonography findings of malignant thyroid tumor are in conformity with most of the papillary carcinomas, but not with follicular carcinomas. The current ultrasonographic features for thyroid malignancy should be cautiously applied as the indication for needle aspiration biopsy so that follicular carcinomas are not missed by too narrow and strict biopsy criteria.
1 Transfer of lens-specific transcripts to retinal RNA samples may underlie observed changes in crystallin-gene transcript levels after ischemia. Retinal ischemia appears to lead to alterations in retinal transcript levels of a group of genes known to be abundantly expressed in the lens. Our purpose is to study whether these alterations are truly the result of retinal ischemia or whether they could be caused by contamination of the retinal tissue with trace amounts of lens tissue. Changes occurring in the retinal gene expression profile after induction of retinal ischemia were assessed by oligonucleotide microarrays and by real-time quantitative PCR. Microarray analysis of the retinal gene expression profile after 5 or 60 min ischemia showed altered transcript levels for a group of genes with functions related to "structural constituent of eye lens" (23 genes, predominantly crystallins). Subsequent qPCR assays for this set of genes showed extremely high variations in transcript levels between individual animals of both control and ischemia-treated groups. However, the relative transcript levels, or expression profile, of these genes was constant in all samples. The transcript levels of these genes were on average 2624-times higher in tissue samples isolated from the superficial layers of the total lens. Moreover, all 23 genes had high expression levels in lens compared to retina as was shown by microarray. From these data, it appears plausible that during isolation of the retina, trace amounts of lens tissue may end up in the studied retinal samples. This would explain the high level of variability in transcript levels of genes, the strong correlation of relative levels between samples, and the link with lens-specific function of the "altered" genes. Changes in crystallin gene expression in other models of retinal degeneration have been reported and a careful examination of the transcript level of other lens-specific genes is essential to rule out a possible confounding effect of lens-material transfer.
0 Model-based therapeutic correction of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a major system maintaining body homeostasis by regulating the neuroendocrine and sympathetic nervous systems as well modulating immune function. Recent work has shown that the complex dynamics of this system accommodate several stable steady states, one of which corresponds to the hypocortisol state observed in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). At present these dynamics are not formally considered in the development of treatment strategies. Here we use model-based predictive control (MPC) methodology to estimate robust treatment courses for displacing the HPA axis from an abnormal hypocortisol steady state back to a healthy cortisol level. This approach was applied to a recent model of HPA axis dynamics incorporating glucocorticoid receptor kinetics. A candidate treatment that displays robust properties in the face of significant biological variability and measurement uncertainty requires that cortisol be further suppressed for a short period until adrenocorticotropic hormone levels exceed 30% of baseline. Treatment may then be discontinued, and the HPA axis will naturally progress to a stable attractor defined by normal hormone levels. Suppression of biologically available cortisol may be achieved through the use of binding proteins such as CBG and certain metabolizing enzymes, thus offering possible avenues for deployment in a clinical setting. Treatment strategies can therefore be designed that maximally exploit system dynamics to provide a robust response to treatment and ensure a positive outcome over a wide range of conditions. Perhaps most importantly, a treatment course involving further reduction in cortisol, even transient, is quite counterintuitive and challenges the conventional strategy of supplementing cortisol levels, an approach based on steady-state reasoning.
1 Protective role of membrane tumour necrosis factor in the host's resistance to mycobacterial infection. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a critical role in the recruitment and activation of mononuclear cells in mycobacterial infection. The role of membrane TNF, in host resistance against Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), was tested in knock-in mice in which the endogenous TNF was replaced by a non-cleavable and regulated allele (Delta1-12, TNF(tm/tm)). While 100% of mice with complete TNF deficiency (TNF(-/-)) succumbed to infection, 50% of TNF(tm/tm) mice were able to control M. bovis BCG infection and survived the experimental period. Membrane expressed TNF allowed a substantial recruitment of activated T cells and macrophages with granuloma formation and expression of bactericidal inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Using virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection we confirm that membrane TNF conferred partial protection. Infection in TNF(tm/tm) double transgenic mice with TNF-R1 or TNF-R2 suggest protection is mediated through TNF-R2 signalling. Therefore, the data suggest that membrane-expressed TNF plays a critical role in host defence to mycobacterial infection and may partially substitute for soluble TNF.
3 Molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC, the aetiological agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), is considered the most pathogenic of the Mycoplasma species. Its virulence is probably the result of a coordinated action of various components of an antigenically and functionally dynamic surface architecture. The different virulence attributes allow the pathogen to evade the host's immune defence, adhere tightly to the host cell surface, persist and disseminate in the host causing mycoplasmaemia, efficiently import energetically valuable nutrients present in the environment, and release and simultaneously translocate toxic metabolic pathway products to the host cell where they cause cytotoxic effects that are known to induce inflammatory processes and disease. This strategy enables the mycoplasma to exploit the minimal genetic information in its small genome, not only to fulfil the basic functions for its replication but also to damage host cells in intimate proximity thereby acquiring the necessary bio-molecules, such as amino acids and nucleic acid precursors, for its own biosynthesis and survival.
1 MR imaging features of obturator internus bursa of the hip. The authors report two cases with distension of the obturator internus bursa identified on MR images, and describe the location and characteristic features of obturator internus bursitis; the "boomerang"-shaped fluid distension between the obturator internus tendon and the posterior grooved surface of the ischium.
3 Taenia solium cysticercosis hotspots surrounding tapeworm carriers: clustering on human seroprevalence but not on seizures. Neurocysticercosis accounts for 30%-50% of all late-onset epilepsy in endemic countries. We assessed the clustering patterns of Taenia solium human cysticercosis seropositivity and seizures around tapeworm carriers in seven rural communities in Peru. The presence of T. solium-specific antibodies was defined as one or more positive bands in the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB). Neurocysticercosis-related seizures cases were diagnosed clinically and had positive neuroimaging or EITB. Eleven tapeworm carriers were identified by stool microscopy. The seroprevalence of human cysticercosis was 24% (196/803). Seroprevalence was 21% >50 m from a carrier and increased to 32% at 1-50 m (p = 0.047), and from that distance seroprevalence had another significant increase to 64% at the homes of carriers (p = 0.004). Seizure prevalence was 3.0% (25/837) but there were no differences between any pair of distance ranges (p = 0.629, Wald test 2 degrees of freedom). We observed a significant human cysticercosis seroprevalence gradient surrounding current tapeworm carriers, although cysticercosis-related seizures did not cluster around carriers. Due to differences in the timing of the two outcomes, seroprevalence may reflect recent T. solium exposure more accurately than seizure frequency.
2 Prediction of refractive error in combined vitrectomy and cataract surgery with one-piece acrylic intraocular lens. To compare the predicted and actual refractive errors of hydrophilic, one-piece, C-flex 570C (C-flex) intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in simultaneous vitrectomy and lens extraction in various conditions. One hundred fifty-nine eyes of patients who had lens extraction between March 2004 and September 2005 were enrolled in a retrospective study. Group 1 had lens extraction and IOL implantation, and Group 2 had lens extraction and IOL implantation with vitrectomy. IOL calculation was done with axial length and keratometry measurements. The actual and predicted refractive errors were compared at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. The factors influencing the postoperative refractive outcomes were analyzed. The mean refractive predictive error (i.e., the actual minus predicted spherical equivalent) was +0.19+/-0.39 D (Diopter) and -0.26+/-0.45 D at 1 and 6 months postoperatively (all: p<0.001) in group 1, and -0.22+/-0.39 D and -0.06+/-0.62 D at 1 and 6 months postoperatively (p=0.013, p=0.399 respectively). In group 2, all surgical factors related to refractive errors were not statistically significant (all: p>0.05). Refractive errors in combined surgery showed myopic shift of -0.50 D and -0.32 D at 1 and 6 months postoperatively compared with C-flex IOL implantation alone. With the hyperopic tendency of IOL and myopic tendency of vitrectomy, the combined surgery made postoperative refractive errors near emmetropia.
3 The influence of high and low levels of estrogen on diurnal urine regulation in young women. Sex hormones have a pronounced effect on arginine vasopressin (AVP), and therefore on the diurnal water homeostasis. Low and high levels of plasma-estradiol as seen in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle may therefore alter the diurnal regulation of urine production. Furthermore the structural resemblance of oxytocin to vasopressin has led to speculations about the possible antidiuretic properties of oxytocin under normal physiological conditions. To elucidate the influence of high and low p-estradiol on the regulation of the diurnal urine production, 15 normal menstruating women (21-33 y) underwent two circadian in-patient investigations, both situated in follicular phase. Admitting the participants solely in the follicular phase resulted in high and low plasma-estradiol whereas plasma-progesterone was similar. Urine and blood samples were taken at predetermined time points to determine plasma AVP, plasma oxytocin, plasma aldosterone, plasma natriuretic peptide (ANP), urinary solute excretions, and urinary excretions of prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) and aquaporin-2 (AQP-2). Blood pressure was measured every hour. Plasma AVP, plasma aldosterone and plasma ANP were unaffected by the different levels of estradiol. All had marked circadian variations whereas oxytocin did not display any circadian rhythm. High estradiol resulted in lower p-osmolality and p-sodium reflecting the downward resetting of the osmoreceptors. Oxytocin did not correlate with either diuresis or urine osmolality. The diurnal urine production was similar in the two groups as were urine osmolality, excretion of PGE-2 and AQP-2. AQP-2 does not have a circadian rhythm and is not significantly correlated to either AVP or oxytocin under normal physiological conditions. High and low level of estradiol has no influence on the circadian rhythm of AVP or the subsequent urine production. High p-estradiol resets the osmoreceptors for AVP release. Furthermore it appears that oxytocin under normal physiological conditions do not contribute to the overall antidiuretic effect.
3 Recombinant mouse PAP has pH-dependent ectonucleotidase activity and acts through A(1)-adenosine receptors to mediate antinociception. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) is expressed in nociceptive neurons and functions as an ectonucleotidase. When injected intraspinally, the secretory isoforms of human and bovine PAP protein have potent and long-lasting antinociceptive effects that are dependent on A(1)-adenosine receptor (A(1)R) activation. In this study, we purified the secretory isoform of mouse (m)PAP using the baculovirus expression system to determine if recombinant mPAP also had antinociceptive properties. We found that mPAP dephosphorylated AMP, and to a much lesser extent, ADP at neutral pH (pH 7.0). In contrast, mPAP dephosphorylated all purine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, ATP) at an acidic pH (pH 5.6). The transmembrane isoform of mPAP had similar pH-dependent ectonucleotidase activity. A single intraspinal injection of mPAP protein had long-lasting (three day) antinociceptive properties, including antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects in the Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) inflammatory pain model. These antinociceptive effects were transiently blocked by the A(1)R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1, 3-dipropylxanthine (CPX), suggesting mPAP dephosphorylates nucleotides to adenosine to mediate antinociception just like human and bovine PAP. Our studies indicate that PAP has species-conserved antinociceptive effects and has pH-dependent ectonucleotidase activity. The ability to metabolize nucleotides in a pH-dependent manner could be relevant to conditions like inflammation where tissue acidosis and nucleotide release occur. Lastly, our studies demonstrate that recombinant PAP protein can be used to treat chronic pain in animal models.
1 Heterochromatic threads connect oscillating chromosomes during prometaphase I in Drosophila oocytes. In Drosophila oocytes achiasmate homologs are faithfully segregated to opposite poles at meiosis I via a process referred to as achiasmate homologous segregation. We observed that achiasmate homologs display dynamic movements on the meiotic spindle during mid-prometaphase. An analysis of living prometaphase oocytes revealed both the rejoining of achiasmate X chromosomes initially located on opposite half-spindles and the separation toward opposite poles of two X chromosomes that were initially located on the same half spindle. When the two achiasmate X chromosomes were positioned on opposite halves of the spindle their kinetochores appeared to display proper co-orientation. However, when both Xs were located on the same half spindle their kinetochores appeared to be oriented in the same direction. Thus, the prometaphase movement of achiasmate chromosomes is a congression-like process in which the two homologs undergo both separation and rejoining events that result in the either loss or establishment of proper kinetochore co-orientation. During this period of dynamic chromosome movement, the achiasmate homologs were connected by heterochromatic threads that can span large distances relative to the length of the developing spindle. Additionally, the passenger complex proteins Incenp and Aurora B appeared to localize to these heterochromatic threads. We propose that these threads assist in the rejoining of homologs and the congression of the migrating achiasmate homologs back to the main chromosomal mass prior to metaphase arrest.
0 Identification and characterization of two trypanosome TFIIS proteins exhibiting particular domain architectures and differential nuclear localizations. Nuclear transcription of Trypanosoma brucei displays unusual features. Most protein-coding genes are organized in large directional gene clusters, which are transcribed polycistronically by RNA polymerase II (pol II) with subsequent processing to generate mature mRNA. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of two trypanosome homologues of transcription elongation factor TFIIS (TbTFIIS1 and TbTFIIS2-1). TFIIS has been shown to aid transcription elongation by relieving arrested pol II. Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the existence of four independent TFIIS expansions across eukaryotes. While TbTFIIS1 contains only the canonical domains II and III, the N-terminus of TbTFIIS2-1 contains a PWWP domain and a domain I. TbTFIIS1 and TbTFIIS2-1 are expressed in procyclic and bloodstream form cells and localize to the nucleus in similar, but distinct, punctate patterns throughout the cell cycle. Neither TFIIS protein was enriched in the major pol II sites of spliced-leader RNA transcription. Single RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock-down and knockout showed that neither protein is essential. Double knock-down, however, impaired growth. Repetitive failure to generate a double knockout of TbTFIIS1 and TbTFIIS2-1 strongly suggests synthetical lethality and thus an essential function shared by the two proteins in trypanosome growth.
1 A comprehensive characterisation of the fibre composition and properties of a limb (flexor digitorum superficialis, membri thoraci) and a trunk (psoas major) muscle in cattle. The fibre type attributes and the relationships among their properties play an important role in the differences in muscle capabilities and features. Comprehensive characterisation of the skeletal muscles should study the degree of association between them and their involvement in muscle functionality. The purposes of the present study were to characterise the fibre type composition of a trunk (Psoas major, PM) and a limb (Flexor digitorum, membri thoraci, FD) muscle in the bovine species and to study the degree of coordination among contractile, metabolic and histological properties of fibre types. Immunohistochemical, histochemical and histological techniques were used. The fibre type composition was delineated immunohistochemically in calf muscle samples, identifying three pure (I, IIA, and IIX) and two hybrid type fibres (I+IIA, and IIAX). Most of the fibres in FD were types I and IIA, while pure IIX were absent. All fibre types were found in PM, the IIX type being the most frequent. Compared to other species, small populations of hybrid fibres were detected. The five fibre types, previously identified, were ascribed to three different acid and alkaline mATPase activity patterns. Type I fibres had the highest oxidative capacity and the lowest glycolytic capacity. The reverse was true for the IIX fibres, whereas the type IIA fibres showed intermediate properties. Regarding the histological properties, type I fibres tended to be more capillarised than the II types. Correlations among contractile, metabolic and histological features on individual fibres were significantly different from zero (r values varied between -0.31 and 0.78). Hybrid fibre values were positioned between their corresponding pure types, and their positions were different regarding their metabolic and contractile properties. Coordination among the contractile, metabolic and histological properties of fibres has been observed. However, the magnitude of the correlation among them is always below 0.8, suggesting that the properties of muscles are not fully explained by the fibre composition. These results support the concept that, to some extent, muscle plasticity can be explained by the fibre type composition, and by the properties derived from their metabolic and histological profiles.
1 A comparison of two methods for estimating odds ratios: results from the National Health Survey. The practice of dichotomizing a continuous outcome variable does not make use of within-category information. That means the loss of information. This study compared two approaches in the modelling of the association between sociodemographic and smoking with obesity in adult women in Iran. We conducted a comparative study between two methods via an illustrative example, using data from the "National Health Survey in Iran (NHSI)" database. It included 14176 women aged 20-69 years. At first, body mass index(BMI) was treated as a continuous variable, ORs and 95 per cent confidence intervals were calculated using the "without dichotomizing" method. Then subjects were classified into obese (BMI > or = 30 kg/m2) and nonobese (BMI < 30 kg/m2) and logistic regression model was used to estimate ORs and 95 per cent confidence intervals. The odds ratio estimates changed only slightly over the two methods. But the "without dichotomizing" method provided shorter confidence intervals on the odds ratio parameters than dichotomizing method. All relative confidence interval lengths were greater than 1.15. If responses are continuous then the "without dichotomizing" method is certainly more useful than the "dichotomizing" method and leads to more precise estimation of odds ratios.
0 MR imaging in a child with scurvy: a case report. Scurvy is very rare disease in industrialized societies. Nevertheless, it still exists in higher risk groups including economically disadvantaged populations with poor nutrition, such as the elderly and chronic alcoholics. The incidence of scurvy in the pediatric population is very low. This study reports a case of scurvy in a 5-year-old girl with cerebral palsy and developmental delay based on MRI findings.
2 Transarterial embolization of an inferior genicular artery pseudoaneurysm with arteriovenous fistula after arthroscopy. Arthroscopic meniscectomy of the knee is generally a safe and effective procedure with a low rate of vascular complications. We report here on a unique case of a 55-year-old man with a lateral inferior genicular artery pseudoaneurysm and a concomitant arteriovenous fistula that developed after arthroscopic meniscectomy; this was successfully treated with selective angiographic embolization. This case illustrates the effectiveness of an endovascular approach as a minimally invasive treatment for this uncommon complication that occurs after an arthroscopic procedure.
0 Human genetic selection on the MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism. The prevalence of genotypes of the 677C>T polymorphism for the MTHFR gene varies among humans. In previous studies, we found changes in the genotypic frequencies of this polymorphism in populations of different ages, suggesting that this could be caused by an increase in the intake of folate and multivitamins by women during the periconceptional period. The aim was to analyze changes in the allelic frequencies of this polymorphism in a Spanish population, including samples from spontaneous abortions (SA). A total of 1305 subjects born in the 20th century were genotyped for the 677C>T polymorphism using allele specific real-time PCR with Taqman probes. A section of our population (n = 276) born in 1980-1989 was compared with fetal samples (n = 344) from SA of unknown etiology from the same period. An increase in the frequency of the T allele (0.38 vs 0.47; p < 0.001) and of the TT genotype (0.14 vs 0.24; p < 0.001) in subjects born in the last quarter of the century was observed. In the 1980-1989 period, the results show that the frequency of the wild type genotype (CC) is about tenfold lower in the SA samples than in the controls (0.03 vs 0.33; p < 0.001) and that the frequency of the TT genotype increases in the controls (0.19 to 0.27) and in the SA samples (0.20 to 0.33 (p < 0.01)); r = 0.98. Selection in favor of the T allele has been detected. This selection could be due to the increased fetal viability in early stages of embryonic development, as is deduced by the increase of mutants in both living and SA populations.
2 Empowering employees with chronic diseases; development of an intervention aimed at job retention and design of a randomised controlled trial. Persons with a chronic disease are less often employed than healthy persons. If employed, many of them experience problems at work. Therefore, we developed a training programme aimed at job retention. The objective of this paper is to describe this intervention and to present the design of a study to evaluate its effectiveness. DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION OF INTERVENTION: A systematic review, a needs assessment and discussions with Dutch experts led to a pilot group training, tested in a pilot study. The evaluation resulted in the development of a seven-session group training combined with three individual counselling sessions. The training is based on an empowerment perspective that aims to help individuals enhance knowledge, skills and self-awareness. These advances are deemed necessary for problem solving in three stages: exploration and clarification of work related problems, communication at the workplace, and development and implementation of solutions. Seven themes are discussed and practised in the group sessions: 1) Consequences of a chronic disease in the workplace, 2) Insight into feelings and thoughts about having a chronic disease, 3) Communication in daily work situations, 4) Facilities for disabled employees and work disability legislation, 5) How to stand up for oneself, 6) A plan to solve problems, 7) Follow-up. Participants are recruited via occupational health services, patient organisations, employers, and a yearly national conference on chronic diseases. They are eligible when they have a chronic physical medical condition, have a paid job, and experience problems at work. Workers on long-term, 100% sick leave that is expected to continue during the training are excluded. After filling in the baseline questionnaire, the participants are randomised to either the control or the intervention group. The control group will receive no care or care as usual. Post-test mail questionnaires will be sent after 4, 8, 12 and 24 months. Primary outcome measures are job retention, self efficacy, fatigue and work pleasure. Secondary outcome measures are work-related problems, sick leave, quality of life, acquired work accommodations, burnout, and several quality of work measures. A process evaluation will be conducted and satisfaction with the training, its components and the training methods will be assessed. Many employees with a chronic condition experience problems in performing tasks and in managing social relations at work. We developed an innovative intervention that addresses practical as well as psychosocial problems. The results of the study will be relevant for employees, employers, occupational health professionals and human resource professionals (HRM). ISRCTN77240155.
1 The use of magnetic resonance imaging to predict the clinical outcome of non-surgical treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. We wanted to investigate the relationship between the magnetic resonance (MR) findings and the clinical outcome after treatment with non-surgical transforaminal epidural steroid injections (ESI) for lumbar herniated intervertebral disc (HIVD) patients. Transforaminal ESI were performed in 91 patients (50 males and 41 females, age range: 13-78 yrs) because of lumbosacral HIVD from March 2001 to August 2002. Sixty eight patients whose MRIs and clinical follow-ups were available were included in this study. The medical charts were retrospectively reviewed and the patients were divided into two groups; the successful (responders, n = 41) and unsatisfactory (non-responders, n = 27) outcome groups. A successful outcome required a patient satisfaction score greater than two and a pain reduction score greater than 50%. The MR findings were retrospectively analyzed and compared between the two groups with regard to the type (protrusion, extrusion or sequestration), hydration (the T2 signal intensity), location (central, right/left central, subarticular, foraminal or extraforaminal), and size (volume) of the HIVD, the grade of nerve root compression (grade 1 abutment, 2 displacement and 3 entrapment), and an association with spinal stenosis. There was no significant difference between the responders and non-responders in terms of the type, hydration and size of the HIVD, or an association with spinal stenosis (p > 0.05). However, the location of the HIVD and the grade of nerve root compression were different between the two groups (p < 0.05). MRI could play an important role in predicting the clinical outcome of non-surgical transforaminal ESI treatment for patients with lumbar HIVD.
1 Atmospheric hypoxia limits selection for large body size in insects. The correlations between Phanerozoic atmospheric oxygen fluctuations and insect body size suggest that higher oxygen levels facilitate the evolution of larger size in insects. Testing this hypothesis we selected Drosophila melanogaster for large size in three oxygen atmospheric partial pressures (aPO(2)). Fly body sizes increased by 15% during 11 generations of size selection in 21 and 40 kPa aPO(2). However, in 10 kPa aPO(2), sizes were strongly reduced. Beginning at the 12(th) generation, flies were returned to normoxia. All flies had similar, enlarged sizes relative to the starting populations, demonstrating that selection for large size had functionally equivalent genetic effects on size that were independent of aPO(2). Hypoxia provided a physical constraint on body size even in a tiny insect strongly selected for larger mass, supporting the hypothesis that Triassic hypoxia may have contributed to a reduction in insect size.
1 Cone inputs to murine striate cortex. We have recorded responses from single neurons in murine visual cortex to determine the effectiveness of the input from the two murine cone photoreceptor mechanisms and whether there is any unique selectivity for cone inputs at this higher region of the visual system that would support the possibility of colour vision in mice. Each eye was stimulated by diffuse light, either 370 (strong stimulus for the ultra-violet (UV) cone opsin) or 505 nm (exclusively stimulating the middle wavelength sensitive (M) cone opsin), obtained from light emitting diodes (LEDs) in the presence of a strong adapting light that suppressed the responses of rods. Single cells responded to these diffuse stimuli in all areas of striate cortex. Two types of responsive cells were encountered. One type (135/323-42%) had little to no spontaneous activity and responded at either the on and/or the off phase of the light stimulus with a few impulses often of relatively large amplitude. A second type (166/323-51%) had spontaneous activity and responded tonically to light stimuli with impulses often of small amplitude. Most of the cells responded similarly to both spectral stimuli. A few (18/323-6%) responded strongly or exclusively to one or the other spectral stimulus and rarely in a spectrally opponent manner. Most cells in murine striate cortex receive excitatory inputs from both UV- and M-cones. A small fraction shows either strong selectivity for one or the other cone mechanism and occasionally cone opponent responses. Cells that could underlie chromatic contrast detection are present but extremely rare in murine striate cortex.
0 Age-related differences in dual task walking: a cross sectional study. Variability in stride velocity during walking characterizes gait instability and predicts falling in older individuals. Walking while executing a cognitive task is also associated with increased risk of falling, particularly in older adults. Variability in stride velocity, particularly during dual task walking conditions, may differ between younger and older individuals. The purpose of this study was to examine whether gait velocity and variability in stride velocity differ between older community-dwelling women and younger women during dual task walking. Twenty-three older (80 +/- 9 years) and 19 younger (23 +/- 2 years) women walked under each of two conditions: (1) walking at a self-selected velocity and (2) walking at a self-selected velocity while incrementally counting backwards. Gait velocity and variability in stride velocity were measured with GAITRite instrumentation. Gait velocity decreased and variability in stride variability increased, in both groups, during dual task walking. The relative reduction in gait velocity and the magnitude of variability in stride velocity were greater in the older subjects than younger subjects. The gait changes observed in dual task walking characterize reduced gait stability and indicate that cognitively demanding tasks during walking have a destabilizing effect on gait that may place older persons at greater risk of falls.
1 Pancreatic metastasis in a child suffering with treated stage 4 neuroblastoma. We present here a very rare case of metastatic relapse in the pancreas of a 4-year-old boy who had been treated for stage 4 neuroblastoma. Computed tomography showed multiple metastatic masses in the pancreas with secondary pancreatitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of pancreatic metastasis in a child with neuroblastoma.
1 Genomics and bacterial pathogenesis. Whole-genome sequencing is transforming the study of pathogenic bacteria. Searches for single virulence genes can now be performed on a genomewide scale by a variety of computer and genetic techniques. These techniques are discussed to provide a perspective on the developing field of genomics.
2 Optimal and continuous anaemia control in a cohort of dialysis patients in Switzerland. Guidelines for the management of anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) recommend a minimal haemoglobin (Hb) target of 11 g/dL. Recent surveys indicate that this requirement is not met in many patients in Europe. In most studies, Hb is only assessed over a short-term period. The aim of this study was to examine the control of anaemia over a continuous long-term period in Switzerland. A prospective multi-centre observational study was conducted in dialysed patients treated with recombinant human epoetin (EPO) beta, over a one-year follow-up period, with monthly assessments of anaemia parameters. Three hundred and fifty patients from 27 centres, representing 14% of the dialysis population in Switzerland, were included. Mean Hb was 11.9 +/- 1.0 g/dL, and remained stable over time. Eighty-five % of the patients achieved mean Hb >or= 11 g/dL. Mean EPO dose was 155 +/- 118 IU/kg/week, being delivered mostly by subcutaneous route (64-71%). Mean serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were 435 +/- 253 microg/L and 30 +/- 11%, respectively. At month 12, adequate iron stores were found in 72.5% of patients, whereas absolute and functional iron deficiencies were observed in only 5.1% and 17.8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that diabetes unexpectedly influenced Hb towards higher levels (12.1 +/- 0.9 g/dL; p = 0.02). One year survival was significantly higher in patients with Hb >or= 11 g/dL than in those with Hb <11 g/dL (19.7% vs 7.3%, p = 0.006). In comparison to European studies of reference, this survey shows a remarkable and continuous control of anaemia in Swiss dialysis centres. These results were reached through moderately high EPO doses, mostly given subcutaneously, and careful iron therapy management.
0 Pulmonary sequestration with right coronary artery supply. Pulmonary sequestration is an unusual malformation consisting of isolated nonfunctioning lung segments lacking communication with functional tracheobronchial trees. Systemic blood supply is commonly from the thoracic aorta, but arteries occasionally arise from other sites. We report a rare form of pulmonary sequestration with arterial supply from the right coronary artery.
0 Candida glabrata environmental stress response involves Saccharomyces cerevisiae Msn2/4 orthologous transcription factors. We determined the genome-wide environmental stress response (ESR) expression profile of Candida glabrata, a human pathogen related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite different habitats, C. glabrata, S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida albicans have a qualitatively similar ESR. We investigate the function of the C. glabrata syntenic orthologues to the ESR transcription factor Msn2. The C. glabrata orthologues CgMsn2 and CgMsn4 contain a motif previously referred to as HD1 (homology domain 1) also present in Msn2 orthologues from fungi closely related to S. cerevisiae. We show that regions including this motif confer stress-regulated intracellular localization when expressed in S. cerevisiae. Site-directed mutagenesis confirms that nuclear export of CgMsn2 in C. glabrata requires an intact HD1. Transcript profiles of CgMsn2/4 mutants and CgMsn2 overexpression strains show that they regulate a part of the CgESR. CgMsn2 complements a S. cerevisiae msn2 null mutant and in stressed C. glabrata cells, rapidly translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus. CgMsn2 is required for full resistance against severe osmotic stress and rapid and full induction of trehalose synthesis genes (TPS1, TPS2). Constitutive activation of CgMsn2 is detrimental for C. glabrata. These results establish an Msn2-regulated general stress response in C. glabrata.
1 The therapeutic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. To evaluate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) in retarding progression of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients. This was a retrospective case control study of 128 patients with normotensive type 2 diabetes with lower than +1 dipstick proteinuria and severe NPDR who were classified into either an ACE-I treated group (Enalapril maleate 10 mg, n=12 , Ramipril 5 mg, n=17) or an ACE-I untreated group (n=99). Medical records were reviewed for endpoints of (a) occurrence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or macular edema (ME) for which laser phototherapy was necessary or (b) development of proteinuria of higher than +1 level requiring medication of ACE-I. From the total of 128 patients, there were 29 ACE-I treated patients and 99 ACE-I untreated patients. There were no differences in the average age, duration of diabetes, body mass indices, blood pressure and levels of hyperglycemia or HbA1C between the two groups. Blood pressure and HbA1C levels in both groups remained unchanged during the study. The mean follow-up period was 41.6 months. In the ACE-I group, 6 patients progressed to PDR, 5 to ME and 6 developed proteinuria of greater than +1 over the follow-up period. In the control group, 30 patients progressed to PDR, 6 to ME and 9 developed proteinuria of greater than +1 over the follow-up period. Small doses of ACE-I did not yield any beneficial effects in retarding the progression of severe NPDR.
1 Usefulness of event-related potentials in the assessment of mild cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to determine if changes in latencies and amplitudes of the major waves of Auditory Event-Related Potentials (AERP), correlate with memory status of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 91 patients with MCI (mean +/- SD age = 66.6 +/- 5.4, MMSE score = 27.7) and 30 age-matched healthy control (AMHC) subjects (mean +/- SD age = 68.9 +/- 9.9) were studied. 54 patients were re-examined after an average period of 14(+/- 5.2) months. During this time period 5 patients converted to AD. Between-group differences in latency and amplitude of the major AERP waves (N200, P300 and Slow Wave) were determined. Within each group, correlation coefficients (CC) between these characteristics of the different AERP waves were calculated. Finally, for patients, CCs were determined among each AERP wave and their age and MMSE scores. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the underlying structure of waveforms both in the control and the patient groups. Latencies of all major AERP components were prolonged in patients compared to controls. Patients presented with significantly higher N200 amplitudes, but no significant differences were observed in P300 amplitudes. Significant differences between follow-up and baseline measurements were found for P300 latency (p = 0.009), N200 amplitude (p < 0.001) and P300 amplitude (p = 0.05). MMSE scores of patients did not correlate with latency or amplitude of the AERP components. Moreover, the establishment of a N200 latency cut-off value of 287 ms resulted in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 91% in the prediction of MCI patients that converted to AD. Although we were not able to establish significant correlations between latencies and amplitudes of N200, P300 and SW and the patients' performance in MMSE, which is a psychometric test for classifying patients suffering from MCI, our results point out that the disorganization of the AERP waveform in MCI patients is a potential basis upon which a neurophysiologic methodology for identifying and "staging" MCI can be sought. We also found that delayed N200 latency not only identifies memory changes better than the MMSE, but also may be a potential predictor of the MCI patients who convert to AD.
0 Genetic and molecular analysis of wild-derived arrhythmic mice. A new circadian variant was isolated by screening the intercross offspring of wild-caught mice (Mus musculus castaneus). This variant was characterized by an initial maintenance of damped oscillations and subsequent loss of rhythmicity after being transferred from light-dark (LD) cycles to constant darkness (DD). To map the genes responsible for the persistence of rhythmicity (circadian ratio) and the length of free-running period (tau), quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed using F(2) mice obtained from an F(1) cross between the circadian variant and C57BL/6J mice. As a result, a significant QTL with a main effect for circadian ratio (Arrhythmicity; Arrh-1) was mapped on Chromosome (Chr) 8. For tau, four significant QTLs, Short free-running period (Sfp-1) (Chr 1), Sfp-2 (Chr 6), Sfp-3 (Chr 8), Sfp-4 (Chr 11) were determined. An epistatic interaction was detected between Chr 3 (Arrh-2) and Chr 5 (Arrh-3). An in situ hybridization study of clock genes and mouse Period1::luciferase (mPer1::luc) real-time monitoring analysis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) suggested that arrhythmicity in this variant might not be attributed to core circadian mechanisms in the SCN neurons. Our strategy using wild-derived variant mice may provide a novel opportunity to evaluate circadian and its related disorders in human that arise from the interaction between multiple variant genes.
3 Risk factors for Nipah virus encephalitis in Bangladesh. Nipah virus (NiV) is a paramyxovirus that causes severe encephalitis in humans. During January 2004, twelve patients with NiV encephalitis (NiVE) were identified in west-central Bangladesh. A case-control study was conducted to identify factors associated with NiV infection. NiVE patients from the outbreak were enrolled in a matched case-control study. Exact odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using a matched analysis. Climbing trees (83% of cases vs. 51% of controls, OR 8.2, 95% CI 1.25-infinity) and contact with another NiVE patient (67% of cases vs. 9% of controls, OR 21.4, 95% CI 2.78-966.1) were associated with infection. We did not identify an increased risk for NiV infection among persons who had contact with a potential intermediate host. Although we cannot rule out person-to-person transmission, case-patients were likely infected from contact with fruit bats or their secretions.
0 LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease - drawing the curtain of penetrance: a commentary. Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and affects about 2% of the population over the age of 60 years. In 2004, mutations in the LRRK2 gene were first described and turned out to be the most frequent genetic cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease and may account for up to 40% of patients in distinct populations. Based on these findings, Latourelle and colleagues show that the penetrance of the most common LRRK2 mutation is higher in patients with familial compared with sporadic Parkinson's disease and identified a substantial number of affected relatives of mutation carriers not presenting with a LRRK2 mutation themselves. This commentary discusses the role of genetic and/or environmental susceptibility factors modulating the expressivity of the disease trait, how these factors may contribute to the phenomenon of phenocopies in genetically defined Parkinson's disease pedigrees, and how the findings of Latourelle and colleagues, published this month in BMC Medicine, relate to current concepts of genetic counselling.
0 A case of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 combined with papillary thyroid carcinoma. This is the first report of papillary thyroid carcinoma combined with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) in Korea. MEN1 is a hereditary disease comprising neoplastic disorders such as pituitary, parathyroid and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, such as gastrinoma. But papillary thyroid cancer was never regarded as its component before in Korea. Herein we present a 39-year-old woman who manifested typical features of MEN1 with a coincidental papillary thyroid carcinoma. Although the family history of MEN1 was definite, her genetic analysis of DNA had revealed no germline mutation in MEN1 gene locus. Unidentified culprit gene unable us further genetic study to find LOH (loss of heterogeneity) in 11q13, the possible explanation of papillary thyroid carcinoma as a new component of MEN1. As we have first experienced a case of MEN1 combined with papillary thyroid carcinoma in Korea, we report it with the review of literature.
3 Identification of distinct human invariant natural killer T-cell response phenotypes to alpha-galactosylceramide. Human CD1d-restricted, invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) are a unique class of T lymphocytes that recognise glycolipid antigens such as alpha-galactosylceramide (alphaGalCer) and upon T cell receptor (TCR) activation produce both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. iNKT cells expand when cultured in-vitro with alphaGalCer and interleukin 2 (IL-2) in a CD1d-restricted manner. However, the expansion ratio of human iNKT cells varies between individuals and this has implications for attempts to manipulate this pathway therapeutically. We have studied a panel of twenty five healthy human donors to assess the variability in their in-vitro iNKT cell expansion responses to stimulation with CD1d ligands and investigated some of the factors that may influence this phenomenon. Although all donors had comparable numbers of circulating iNKT cells their growth rates in-vitro over 14 days in response to a range of CD1d ligands and IL-2 were highly donor-dependent. Two reproducible donor response patterns of iNKT expansion were seen which we have called 'strong' or 'poor' iNKT responders. Donor response phenotype did not correlate with age, gender, frequency of circulating iNKT, or with the CD1d ligand utilised. Addition of exogenous recombinant human interleukin 4 (IL-4) to 'poor' responder donor cultures significantly increased their iNKT proliferative capacity, but not to levels equivalent to that of 'strong' responder donors. However in 'strong' responder donors, addition of IL-4 to their cultures did not significantly alter the frequency of iNKT cells in the expanded CD3+ population. (i) in-vitro expansion of human iNKT cells in response to CD1d ligand activation is highly donor variable, (ii) two reproducible patterns of donor iNKT expansion were observed, which could be classified into 'strong' and 'poor' responder phenotypes, (iii) donor iNKT response phenotypes did not correlate with age, gender, frequency of circulating iNKT cells, or with the CD1d ligand utilised, (iv) addition of IL-4 to 'poor' but not 'strong' responder donor cultures significantly increased their in-vitro iNKT cell expansion to alphaGalCer.
1 Reliable microRNA profiling in routinely processed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer specimens using fluorescence labelled bead technology. During the last years the analysis of microRNA expression patterns has led to completely new insights into cancer biology. Furthermore, these patterns are a very promising tool for the development of new diagnostic and prognostic markers. However, most human tumour samples for which long term clinical records are available exist only as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of microRNA profiling studies in routinely processed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human breast cancer specimens using fluorescence labelled bead technology. A statistically highly significant correlation (Spearman r: 0.78 - 0.90, p < 0.0001) was observed for the expression of 319 microRNAs in routinely processed FFPE breast cancer specimens and paired fresh frozen tissue samples (n = 5). Results were confirmed in a larger series analyzing a selection of 10 microRNAs reported to be deregulated in breast cancer (n = 12). The expression pattern of 3 microRNAs was independently validated in this cohort using real-time RT-PCR technology. Comprehensive microRNA expression patterns can be reliably derived from routinely processed FFPE breast cancer specimens using fluorescence labelled bead technology.
3 Role of cAMP in the promotion of colorectal cancer cell growth by prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a product of the cyclooxygenase (COX) reaction, stimulates the growth of colonic epithelial cells. It is inferred that the abrogation of prostaglandins' growth-promoting effects as a result of COX inhibition underlies the advantageous effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Despite this appreciation, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure since cell culture studies have yielded discrepant results regarding PGE2's mitogenicity. We have employed several alternative approaches to score cell proliferation and apoptosis of 4 CRC cell lines exposed to PGE2 under various conditions. To investigate the role of cAMP in PGE2's functions, activation of the cAMP pathway was assessed at different levels (changes in cAMP levels and PKA activity) in cells subjected to specific manipulations including the use of specific inhibitors or prostanoid receptor-selective agonists/antagonists. Our data document that the dose-response curve to PGE2 is 'bell-shaped', with nano molar concentrations of PGE2 being more mitogenic than micro molar doses. Remarkably, mitogenicity inversely correlates with the ability of PGE2 doses to raise cAMP levels. Consistent with a major role for cAMP, cAMP raising agents and pertussis toxin revert the mitogenic response to PGE2. Accordingly, use of prostanoid receptor-selective agonists argues for the involvement of the EP3 receptor and serum deprivation of HT29 CRC cells specifically raises the levels of Gi-coupled EP3 splice variants. The present data indicate that the mitogenic action of low PGE2 doses in CRC cells is mediated via Gi-proteins, most likely through the EP3 receptor subtype, and is superimposed by a second, cAMP-dependent anti-proliferative effect at higher PGE2 doses. We discuss how these findings contribute to rationalize conflictive literature data on the proliferative action of PGE2.
2 Nitric oxide administration using an oxygen hood: a pilot trial. We have shown earlier that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) administered by oxygen hood reduces pulmonary hypertension in an animal model (J Perinatol 2002; 22:50-6). Our objective in this study was to determine feasibility of iNO by oxygen hood in neonates with elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients (A-aDO(2)). Masked randomized controlled pilot trial. Inclusion criteria were: gestation>or=34 weeks, age<7 days, with post-ductal arterial line, and A-aDO(2) 400-600. Infants were randomized to study gas (iNO 20 ppm or equivalent O(2) flow) for 1 hr which was then weaned over the next 4 hours. Primary outcome was PaO(2) one hour post-randomization. Four infants each were randomized to iNO or O(2) (controls). Two of the four infants given iNO had an increase in PaO(2) of >100 torr, while oxygenation was unchanged in the controls. Methemoglobinemia and other adverse effects were not noted in any infant. Environmental levels of NO and NO(2) were minimal (<1 ppm) at >0.3 m from the hood. Administration of iNO by oxygen hood is feasible. Larger randomized controlled trials are required to measure the efficacy and determine an appropriate target population for this technique.

1 Array-based evolution of DNA aptamers allows modelling of an explicit sequence-fitness landscape. Mapping the landscape of possible macromolecular polymer sequences to their fitness in performing biological functions is a challenge across the biosciences. A paradigm is the case of aptamers, nucleic acids that can be selected to bind particular target molecules. We have characterized the sequence-fitness landscape for aptamers binding allophycocyanin (APC) protein via a novel Closed Loop Aptameric Directed Evolution (CLADE) approach. In contrast to the conventional SELEX methodology, selection and mutation of aptamer sequences was carried out in silico, with explicit fitness assays for 44,131 aptamers of known sequence using DNA microarrays in vitro. We capture the landscape using a predictive machine learning model linking sequence features and function and validate this model using 5500 entirely separate test sequences, which give a very high observed versus predicted correlation of 0.87. This approach reveals a complex sequence-fitness mapping, and hypotheses for the physical basis of aptameric binding; it also enables rapid design of novel aptamers with desired binding properties. We demonstrate an extension to the approach by incorporating prior knowledge into CLADE, resulting in some of the tightest binding sequences.
3 All-trans retinoic acid inhibits type 1 diabetes by T regulatory (Treg)-dependent suppression of interferon-gamma-producing T-cells without affecting Th17 cells. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a potent derivative of vitamin A, can regulate immune responses. However, its role in inducing immune tolerance associated with the prevention of islet inflammation and inhibition of type 1 diabetes remains unclear. We investigated the mechanisms underlying the potential immunoregulatory effect of ATRA on type 1 diabetes using an adoptive transfer animal model of the disease. Our data demonstrated that ATRA treatment inhibited diabetes in NOD mice with established insulitis. In addition, it suppressed interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T effector (Teff) cells and expanded T regulatory (Treg) cells in recipient mice transferred with diabetic NOD splenocytes, without affecting either interleukin (IL)-17--or IL-4-producing cells. Consistent with these results, ATRA reduced T-bet and STAT4 expression in T-cells and decreased islet-infiltrating CD8(+) T-cells, suppressing their activation and IFN-gamma/granzyme B expression. Depletion of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells impaired the inhibitory effect of ATRA on islet-infiltrating T-cells and blocked its protective effect on diabetes. Therefore, ATRA treatment induced Treg cell-dependent immune tolerance by suppressing both CD4(+) and CD8(+) Teff cells while promoting Treg cell expansion. These results demonstrate that ATRA treatment promoted in vivo expansion of Treg cells and induced Treg cell-dependent immune tolerance by suppressing IFN-gamma-producing T-cells, without affecting Th17 cells. Our study also provides novel insights into how ATRA induces immune tolerance in vivo via its effects on Teff and Treg cells.
3 Recognition of human proinsulin leader sequence by class I-restricted T-cells in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice and in human type 1 diabetes. A restricted region of proinsulin located in the B chain and adjacent region of C-peptide has been shown to contain numerous candidate epitopes recognized by CD8(+) T-cells. Our objective is to characterize HLA class I-restricted epitopes located within the preproinsulin leader sequence. Seven 8- to 11-mer preproinsulin peptides carrying anchoring residues for HLA-A1, -A2, -A24, and -B8 were selected from databases. HLA-A2-restricted peptides were tested for immunogenicity in transgenic mice expressing a chimeric HLA-A*0201/beta2-microglobulin molecule. The peptides were studied for binding to purified HLA class I molecules, selected for carrying COOH-terminal residues generated by proteasome digestion in vitro and tested for recognition by human lymphocytes using an ex vivo interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) ELISpot assay. Five HLA-A2-restricted peptides were immunogenic in transgenic mice. Murine T-cell clones specific for these peptides were cytotoxic against cells transfected with the preproinsulin gene. They were recognized by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 17 of 21 HLA-A2 type 1 diabetic patients. PBMCs from 25 of 38 HLA-A1, -A2, -A24, or -B8 patients produced IFN-gamma in response to six preproinsulin peptides covering residues 2-25 within the preproinsulin region. In most patients, the response was against several class I-restricted peptides. T-cells recognizing preproinsulin peptide were characterized as CD8(+) T-cells by staining with peptide/HLA-A2 tetramers. We defined class I-restricted epitopes located within the leader sequence of human preproinsulin through in vivo (transgenic mice) and ex vivo (diabetic patients) assays, illustrating the possible role of preproinsulin-specific CD8(+) T-cells in human type 1 diabetes.
0 Estrogen directly activates AID transcription and function. The immunological targets of estrogen at the molecular, humoral, and cellular level have been well documented, as has estrogen's role in establishing a gender bias in autoimmunity and cancer. During a healthy immune response, activation-induced deaminase (AID) deaminates cytosines at immunoglobulin (Ig) loci, initiating somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). Protein levels of nuclear AID are tightly controlled, as unregulated expression can lead to alterations in the immune response. Furthermore, hyperactivation of AID outside the immune system leads to oncogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the estrogen-estrogen receptor complex binds to the AID promoter, enhancing AID messenger RNA expression, leading to a direct increase in AID protein production and alterations in SHM and CSR at the Ig locus. Enhanced translocations of the c-myc oncogene showed that the genotoxicity of estrogen via AID production was not limited to the Ig locus. Outside of the immune system (e.g., breast and ovaries), estrogen induced AID expression by >20-fold. The estrogen response was also partially conserved within the DNA deaminase family (APOBEC3B, -3F, and -3G), and could be inhibited by tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist. We therefore suggest that estrogen-induced autoimmunity and oncogenesis may be derived through AID-dependent DNA instability.
0 Insulin-like growth factor-1 coordinately induces the expression of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic genes in murine C2C12 myoblasts. We present evidence that a major aspect of the mechanism of acute signal transduction regulation by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in cultured murine myoblasts is associated with a broad perturbation of many components of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. We have used microarray transcriptional analysis to examine the acute effects of IGF-1 on global patterns of gene expression in C2C12 myoblasts and have identified approximately 157 genes that are up-regulated and 75 genes down-regulated from 2- to 6-fold after treatment with IGF-1. Of the up-regulated genes, 19 genes are associated with cholesterol biosynthesis and 5 genes specify aspects of fatty acid biosynthesis. In addition 10 recognized transcription factors are significantly induced by IGF-1 at 1 hour. The SREBPs, important regulators of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, operate via a post-transcriptional route and no significant transcriptional induction was observed in the 4 hr of IGF-1 treatment. Since there are no prior reports of significant and coordinated perturbations of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways with IGF-1 in muscle cells, these findings provide a substantive expansion of our understanding of IGF-1 action and the signal transduction pathways mediated by it, its variants and insulin.
3 Versatile, immersive, creative and dynamic virtual 3-D healthcare learning environments: a review of the literature. The author provides a critical overview of three-dimensional (3-D) virtual worlds and "serious gaming" that are currently being developed and used in healthcare professional education and medicine. The relevance of this e-learning innovation for teaching students and professionals is debatable and variables influencing adoption, such as increased knowledge, self-directed learning, and peer collaboration, by academics, healthcare professionals, and business executives are examined while looking at various Web 2.0/3.0 applications. There is a need for more empirical research in order to unearth the pedagogical outcomes and advantages associated with this e-learning technology. A brief description of Roger's Diffusion of Innovations Theory and Siemens' Connectivism Theory for today's learners is presented as potential underlying pedagogical tenets to support the use of virtual 3-D learning environments in higher education and healthcare.
3 Hydatid disease involving some rare locations in the body: a pictorial essay. Hydatid disease (HD) is an endemic illness in many countries, and it poses an important public health problem that's influenced by peoples' socioeconomic status and migration that spreads this disease. Although rare, it may occur in any organ or tissue. The most common site is the liver (59-75%), followed in frequency by lung (27%), kidney (3%), bone (1-4%) and brain (1-2%). Other sites such as the heart, spleen, pancreas and muscles are very rarely affected. Unusual sites for this disease can cause diagnostic problems. This pictorial essay illustrates various radiological findings of HD in the liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, peritoneal cavity, omentum, adrenal, ovary, lung, mediastinum and retroperitoneum. Familiarity with the imaging findings of HD may be helpful in making an accurate diagnosis and preventing potential complications.
3 Negative regulation of syntaxin4/SNAP-23/VAMP2-mediated membrane fusion by Munc18c in vitro. Translocation of the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 from an intracellular store to the plasma membrane is responsible for the increased rate of glucose transport into fat and muscle cells in response to insulin. This represents a specialised form of regulated membrane trafficking. Intracellular membrane traffic is subject to multiple levels of regulation by conserved families of proteins in all eukaryotic cells. Notably, all intracellular fusion events require SNARE proteins and Sec1p/Munc18 family members. Fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane of insulin-sensitive cells involves the SM protein Munc18c, and is regulated by the formation of syntaxin 4/SNAP23/VAMP2 SNARE complexes. Here we have used biochemical approaches to characterise the interaction(s) of Munc18c with its cognate SNARE proteins and to examine the role of Munc18c in regulating liposome fusion catalysed by syntaxin 4/SNAP23/VAMP2 SNARE complex formation. We demonstrate that Munc18c makes contacts with both t- and v-SNARE proteins of this complex, and directly inhibits bilayer fusion mediated by the syntaxin 4/SNAP23/VAMP2 SNARE complex. Our reductionist approach has enabled us to ascertain a direct inhibitory role for Munc18c in regulating membrane fusion mediated by syntaxin 4/SNAP23/VAMP2 SNARE complex formation. It is important to note that two different SM proteins have recently been shown to stimulate liposome fusion mediated by their cognate SNARE complexes. Given the structural similarities between SM proteins, it seems unlikely that different members of this family perform opposing regulatory functions. Hence, our findings indicate that Munc18c requires a further level of regulation in order to stimulate SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.
2 Cerebral ischemia detected with diffusion-weighted MR imaging after protected carotid artery stenting: comparison of distal balloon and filter device. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence of ischemia during protected carotid artery stenting (CAS) as well as to compare the protective efficacy of the balloon and filter devices on diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI). Seventy-one consecutive protected CAS procedures in 70 patients with a severe (> 70%) or symptomatic moderate (> 50%) carotid artery stenosis were examined. A balloon device (PercuSurge GuardWire) and a filter device (FilterWire EX/EZ, Emboshield) was used in 33 cases (CAS-B group) and 38 cases (CAS-F group) to prevent distal embolization, respectively. All the patients underwent DWI within seven days before and after the procedures. The number of new cerebral ischemic lesions on the post-procedural DWI were counted and divided into ipsilateral and contralateral lesions according to the relationship with the stenting side. New cerebral ischemic lesions were detected in 13 (39.4%) out of the 33 CAS-Bs and in 15 (39.5%) out of the 38 CAS-Fs. The mean number of total, ipsilateral and contralateral new cerebral ischemic lesion was 2.39, 1.67 and 0.73 in the CAS-B group and 2.11, 1.32 and 0.79 in the CAS-F group, respectively. No statistical differences were found between the two groups (p = 0.96, 0.74 and 0.65, respectively). The embolic complications encountered included two retinal infarctions and one hemiparesis in the CAS-B group (9.09%), and one retinal infarction, one hemiparesis and one ataxia in the CAS-F group (7.89%). There was a similar incidence of embolic complications in the two groups (p = 1.00). The type of distal protection device used such as a balloon and filter does not affect the incidence of cerebral embolization after protected CAS.
3 Rex1p deficiency leads to accumulation of precursor initiator tRNAMet and polyadenylation of substrate RNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A synthetic genetic array was used to identify lethal and slow-growth phenotypes produced when a mutation in TRM6, which encodes a tRNA modification enzyme subunit, was combined with the deletion of any non-essential gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that deletion of the REX1 gene resulted in a slow-growth phenotype in the trm6-504 strain. Previously, REX1 was shown to be involved in processing the 3' ends of 5S rRNA and the dimeric tRNA(Arg)-tRNA(Asp). In this study, we have discovered a requirement for Rex1p in processing the 3' end of tRNA(i)(Met) precursors and show that precursor tRNA(i)(Met) accumulates in a trm6-504 rex1Delta strain. Loss of Rex1p results in polyadenylation of its substrates, including tRNA(i)(Met), suggesting that defects in 3' end processing can activate the nuclear surveillance pathway. Finally, purified Rex1p displays Mg(2+)-dependent ribonuclease activity in vitro, and the enzyme is inactivated by mutation of two highly conserved amino acids.
3 Imported lassa fever in Germany: molecular characterization of a new lassa virus strain. We describe the isolation and characterization of a new Lassa virus strain imported into Germany by a traveler who had visited Ghana, Côte D'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso. This strain, designated "AV," originated from a region in West Africa where Lassa fever has not been reported. Viral S RNA isolated from the patient's serum was amplified and sequenced. A long-range reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction allowed amplification of the full-length (3.4 kb) S RNA. The coding sequences of strain AV differed from those of all known Lassa prototype strains (Josiah, Nigeria, and LP) by approximately 20%, mainly at third codon positions. Phylogenetically, strain AV appears to be most closely related to strain Josiah from Sierra Leone. Lassa viruses comprise a group of genetically highly diverse strains, which has implications for vaccine development. The new method for full-length S RNA amplification may facilitate identification and molecular analysis of new arenaviruses or arenavirus strains.
2 The combined dexamethasone/CRH Test (DEX/CRH test) and prediction of acute treatment response in major depression. In this study the predictive value of the combined dexamethasone/CRH test (DEX/CRH test) for acute antidepressant response was investigated. In 114 depressed inpatients suffering from unipolar or bipolar depression (sample 1) the DEX/CRH test was performed at admission and shortly before discharge. During their stay in the hospital patients received different antidepressant treatment regimens. At admission, the rate of nonsuppression (basal cortisol levels >75.3 nmol/l) was 24.6% and was not related to the later therapeutic response. Moreover, 45 out of 114 (39.5%) patients showed an enhancement of HPA axis function at discharge in spite of clinical improvement. In a second sample, 40 depressed patients were treated either with reboxetine or mirtazapine for 5 weeks. The DEX/CRH test was performed before, after 1 week, and after 5 weeks of pharmacotherapy. Attenuation of HPA axis activity after 1 week was associated with a more pronounced alleviation of depressive symptoms after 5-week mirtazapine treatment, whereas downregulation of HPA system activity after 5 weeks was related to clinical response to reboxetine. However, early improvement of HPA axis dysregulation was not necessarily followed by a beneficial treatment outcome. Taken together, performance of a single DEX/CRH test does not predict the therapeutic response. The best predictor for response seems to be an early attenuation of HPA axis activity within 1 or 2 weeks. However, early improvement of HPA system dysfunction is not a sufficient condition for a favourable response. Since a substantial part of depressive patients display a persistence of HPA axis hyperactivity at discharge, downregulation of HPA system function is not a necessary condition for acute clinical improvement either. Our data underline the importance of HPA axis dysregulation for treatment outcome in major depression, although restoration of HPA system dysfunction seems to be neither a necessary nor a sufficient determinant for acute treatment response.
1 Morton neuroma: evaluated with ultrasonography and MR imaging. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of both ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of Morton neuroma. Our study group was comprised of 20 neuromas from 17 patients, and the neuromas were confirmed on surgery following evaluation with US, MRI, or both US and MRI. The diagnostic criterion for Morton neuroma, as examined by US, was the presence of a round or ovoid, well-defined, hypoechoic mass. The diagnostic criterion, based on MR imaging, was a well defined mass with intermediate to low signal intensity on both the T1- and T2-weighted images. The retrospective comparison between the sonographic and MR images was done by two experienced radiologists working in consensus with the surgical and pathologic correlations. The detection rate of Morton neuroma was 79% for 14 neuromas from 11 patients who had undergone US followed by an operation. The detection rate was 76% for 17 neuromas from 15 patients who had undergone MRI and a subsequent operation. The mean size of the examined neuromas was 4.9 mm on the US images and it was 5.1 mm on the MRI studies. Ten neuromas (71%) were 5 mm or less as measured by US, and three neuromas were not detected, whereas on the MRI analysis, 10 neuromas (59%) were 5 mm or less and four neuromas were not visualized. Among the patients examined during postoperative follow-up, symptoms were completely relieved in 85% and the symptoms were partially relieved in 15%. US and MR imaging are comparable modalities with high detection rate for the evaluation of Morton neuroma.
0 Prevalence and control of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in New York City. To determine the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and to assess clinical management indicators among adults with diabetes in a representative sample of New York City adults. In 2004, New York City implemented the first community-level Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES), modeled after the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used an interview to determine previously diagnosed diabetes and measured fasting plasma glucose to determine undiagnosed diabetes and IFG in a probability sample of 1,336 New York City adults. We assessed glycemic control and other clinical indicators using standardized NHANES protocols. The prevalence of diabetes among New York City adults was 12.5% (95% CI 10.3-15.1): 8.7% diagnosed and 3.8% undiagnosed. Nearly one-fourth (23.5%) of adults had IFG. Asians had the highest prevalence of impaired glucose metabolism (diabetes 16.1%, IFG 32.4%) but were significantly less likely to be obese. Among adults with diagnosed diabetes, less than one-half (45%) had A1C levels <7%; one-half (50%) had elevated blood pressure measures at interview, 43% of whom were not on antihypertensive medications; nearly two-thirds (66%) had elevated LDL levels, and only 10% had their glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol all at or below recommended levels. Most adults (84%) with diagnosed diabetes were on medication, but only 12% were receiving insulin. In New York City, diabetes and IFG are widespread. Policies and structural interventions to promote physical activity and healthy eating should be prioritized. Improved disease management systems are needed for people with diabetes.
0 Emerging and reemerging helminthiases and the public health of China. Despite great strides in their control throughout the People's Republic of China, helminth infections remain an important public health problem. The Institute of Parasitic Diseases of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, under the guidance of the Chinese Ministry of Health, completed a nationwide survey of more than 1 million people that showed the high prevalence and intensity of intestinal nematode infections; prevalence can sometimes exceed 50% in the Yangtze River valley provinces. Schistosoma japonicum is also a major cause of illness in this region. Attempts to control Chinese helminthic diseases with conventional anthelminthic drugs have been partially thwarted by high posttreatment rates of reinfection. Recently, several new human trematode pathogens have been identified. Novel approaches to chemoprophylaxis and vaccination may alleviate the public health problem caused by Chinese helminths. However, recombinant helminth vaccine development will depend on first cataloguing the extensive genetic diversity of Chinese helminths and candidate vaccine antigens. Evidence from biogeography, genetics, and systematics suggests that the genetic diversification of Chinese helminths and their vectors is an ongoing evolutionary process that began 12 million years ago near the convergence of major Asian river systems. Construction of the Three Gorges Super Dam on the Yangtze River may promote the emergence and reemergence of new helminths and their snail vectors
1 Association of parental obesity with concentrations of select systemic biomarkers in nonobese offspring: the Framingham Heart Study. Parental obesity is a risk factor for offspring obesity. It is unclear whether parental obesity also confers risk for obesity-associated conditions (e.g., a proinflammatory or prothrombotic state) in the absence of offspring obesity. We compared concentrations of multiple biomarkers representing distinct biological pathways (C-reactive protein [CRP], aldosterone, renin, B-type natriuretic peptide, NH(2)-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) in nonobese Framingham Offspring Study participants with no parents (n = 665), one parent (n = 488), or two parents (n = 119) with obesity (BMI > or =30 kg/m(2)). Nonobese offspring with both parents with obesity had higher CRP levels (median 2.16 mg/l) than offspring with one parent (1.58 mg/l) or no parents (1.35 mg/l) with obesity. After multivariable adjustment, a nonlinear relationship with parental obesity became evident: compared with those without parental obesity, CRP levels were higher in offspring with two obese parents (P = 0.04) but not in offspring with only one obese parent (P = 0.76). Renin levels were more linearly related to parental obesity status, being significantly higher in offspring with one parent (P = 0.04) or two parents (P = 0.09) with obesity (P = 0.02 for trend). The other systemic biomarkers did not vary according to parental obesity status (all P > 0.05). Our findings suggest that offspring with a high risk of developing obesity have an altered biomarker profile, characterized by systemic inflammation and increased neurohormonal activity, even in the absence of obesity. This is consistent with the notion that parental obesity may confer an increased susceptibility to other adiposity-associated traits.
1 Comparison of OCT and HRT findings among normal, normal tension glaucoma, and high tension glaucoma. To evaluate the relationship between optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurements obtained with the optical coherence tomography (OCT) and the Heidelberg retina topography (HRT) in normal, normal tension glaucoma (NTG), and high tension glaucoma (HTG). Normal, NTG and HTG subjects who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were evaluated retrospectively. One hundred seventy eyes of 170 patients (30 normal, 40 NTG, and 100 HTG) were enrolled. Complete ophthalmologic examination, HRT, OCT, and automated perimetry were evaluated. Disc area, cup area and cup/disc area ratio measured with HRT were significantly different between NTG and HTG (all p < 0.05). Mean RNFL thickness measured by OCT with ascanning diameter of 3.4 mm was larger in NTG than HTG (84.97+/-24.20 micrometer vs. 73.53+/-27.17 micrometer, p = 0.037). Four quadrant RNFL thickness measurements were not significantly different between NTG and HTG (all p > 0.05). Mean deviation and corrected pattern standard deviation measured by automated perimetry was significantly correlated with mean and inferior RNFL thickness in both NTG and HTG (Pearson's r, p < 0.05). Mean RNFL thickness/disc area ratio was significantly larger in HTG than NTG (35.21+/-18.92 vs. 31.30+/-10.91, p = 0.004). These findings suggest that optic disc and RNFL damage pattern in NTG may be different from those of HTG.
0 Cognitive-enhancing effects of angiotensin IV. Angiotensin IV is a derivative of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and it has been shown to enhance acquisition, consolidation and recall in animal models of learning and memory when administered centrally or peripherally. Whether changes in angiotensin IV activity underlie the cognitive effects of those cardiovascular drugs designed to disrupt the peripheral renin-angiotensin system in humans remains undetermined, but angiotensin IV appears to be a worthy candidate for consideration in drug development programmes. The mechanism of action of angiotensin IV is still debated, although its AT4 receptor has been convincingly identified as being insulin-regulated amino peptidase, which is also known as oxytocinase and placental leucine aminopeptidase. It is speculated that angiotensin IV may interact with insulin-regulated amino peptidase to enhance neuronal glucose uptake, prevent metabolism of other neuroactive peptides, induce changes in extracellular matrix molecules, or induce release of acetylcholine and/or dopamine. All of these things may be responsible for the beneficial effects on cognition, but none of them are yet proven. Importantly, strain differences in murine responses to angiotensin IV suggest that some individuals may benefit from drugs targeted to the AT4 receptor whilst others may be refractory. At present it thus appears that those individuals with the poorest baseline cognition may receive greatest benefit, but possible genetic differences in responses to angiotensin IV cannot be ruled-out.
2 Bilateral spontaneous anterior lens dislocation in a retinitis pigmentosa patient. To report a case of bilateral spontaneous anterior lens dislocation associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). A 45-year-old male with RP presented with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the right eye and was treated with laser iridotomy (LI). After LI, complete crystalline lens dislocation into the anterior chamber occurred. Surgical intervention, including anterior vitrectomy, intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE), and IOL scleral fixation was performed. Two years later, the same episode occurred in his left eye and a similar treatment was done. Surgery was successful in both eyes. This is the first report of bilateral spontaneous anterior lens dislocation in a RP patient.
3 Low-dose methotrexate therapy for intravenous immunoglobulin-resistant Kawasaki disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose oral methotrexate (MTX) as a treatment for patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) which was resistant to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The patients who had persistent or recrudescent fever after treatment with IVIG were subsequently treated with low-dose oral MTX [10mg/body surface area (BSA)] once weekly. Seventeen patients developed persistent or recrudescent fever after treatment of KD with IVIG and were consequently given MTX. The proportion of children with coronary artery lesions (CALs) was 76%. The median value of maximum body temperatures decreased significantly within 24 hours of MTX therapy (38.6 degrees C vs. 37.0 degrees C, p < 0.001). The median CRP (C-reactive protein) level was found to be significantly lower 1 week after administering the first dose of MTX (8.9mg/dL vs. 1.2mg/dL, p < 0.001). The median duration of fever before MTX treatment was shorter in CALs (-) group than in CALs (+) group (7 days vs. 10 days, p = 0.023). No adverse effects of MTX were observed. MTX treatment for IVIG-resistant KD resulted in quick resolution of fever and rapid improvement of inflammation markers without causing any adverse effects. MTX therapy should further be assessed in a multicenter, placebo-blinded trial to evaluate whether it also improves coronary artery outcome.
1 High-resolution analysis of the 5'-end transcriptome using a next generation DNA sequencer. Massively parallel, tag-based sequencing systems, such as the SOLiD system, hold the promise of revolutionizing the study of whole genome gene expression due to the number of data points that can be generated in a simple and cost-effective manner. We describe the development of a 5'-end transcriptome workflow for the SOLiD system and demonstrate the advantages in sensitivity and dynamic range offered by this tag-based application over traditional approaches for the study of whole genome gene expression. 5'-end transcriptome analysis was used to study whole genome gene expression within a colon cancer cell line, HT-29, treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5Aza). More than 20 million 25-base 5'-end tags were obtained from untreated and 5Aza-treated cells and matched to sequences within the human genome. Seventy three percent of the mapped unique tags were associated with RefSeq cDNA sequences, corresponding to approximately 14,000 different protein-coding genes in this single cell type. The level of expression of these genes ranged from 0.02 to 4,704 transcripts per cell. The sensitivity of a single sequence run of the SOLiD platform was 100-1,000 fold greater than that observed from 5'end SAGE data generated from the analysis of 70,000 tags obtained by Sanger sequencing. The high-resolution 5'end gene expression profiling presented in this study will not only provide novel insight into the transcriptional machinery but should also serve as a basis for a better understanding of cell biology.
2 The role of anti-malarial drugs in eliminating malaria. Effective anti-malarial drug treatment reduces malaria transmission. This alone can reduce the incidence and prevalence of malaria, although the effects are greater in areas of low transmission where a greater proportion of the infectious reservoir is symptomatic and receives anti-malarial treatment. Effective treatment has greater effects on the transmission of falciparum malaria, where gametocytogenesis is delayed, compared with the other human malarias in which peak gametocytaemia and transmissibility coincides with peak asexual parasite densities. Mature Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes are more drug resistant and affected only by artemisinins and 8-aminoquinolines. The key operational question now is whether primaquine should be added to artemisinin combination treatments for the treatment of falciparum malaria to reduce further the transmissibility of the treated infection. Radical treatment with primaquine plays a key role in the eradication of vivax and ovale malaria. More evidence is needed on the safety of primaquine when administered without screening for G6PD deficiency to inform individual and mass treatment approaches in the context of malaria elimination programmes.
3 Falciparum malaria in European tourists to the Dominican Republic. Thirteen cases of falciparum malaria acquired by Europeans in the Dominican Republic occurred from June 1999 to February 2000. The cases were identified by the European Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance (TropNetEurop).
3 hnRNP I inhibits Notch signaling and regulates intestinal epithelial homeostasis in the zebrafish. Regulated intestinal stem cell proliferation and differentiation are required for normal intestinal homeostasis and repair after injury. The Notch signaling pathway plays fundamental roles in the intestinal epithelium. Despite the fact that Notch signaling maintains intestinal stem cells in a proliferative state and promotes absorptive cell differentiation in most species, it remains largely unclear how Notch signaling itself is precisely controlled during intestinal homeostasis. We characterized the intestinal phenotypes of brom bones, a zebrafish mutant carrying a nonsense mutation in hnRNP I. We found that the brom bones mutant displays a number of intestinal defects, including compromised secretory goblet cell differentiation, hyperproliferation, and enhanced apoptosis. These phenotypes are accompanied by a markedly elevated Notch signaling activity in the intestinal epithelium. When overexpressed, hnRNP I destabilizes the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and inhibits Notch signaling. This activity of hnRNP I is conserved from zebrafish to human. In addition, our biochemistry experiments demonstrate that the effect of hnRNP I on NICD turnover requires the C-terminal portion of the RAM domain of NICD. Our results demonstrate that hnRNP I is an evolutionarily conserved Notch inhibitor and plays an essential role in intestinal homeostasis.
1 Tracking drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in Oregon: an alternative surveillance method. With the emergence of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, community-specific antimicrobial susceptibility patterns have become valuable determinants of empiric therapy for S. pneumoniae infections. Traditionally, these patterns are tracked by active surveillance for invasive disease, collection of isolates, and centralized susceptibility testing. We investigated whether a simpler and less expensive method aggregating existing hospital antibiograms--could provide community-specific antimicrobial susceptibility data. We compared 1996 active surveillance data with antibiogram data from hospital laboratories in Portland, Oregon. Of the 178 S. pneumoniae active surveillance isolates, 153 (86% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 80% to 91%]) were susceptible to penicillin. Of the 1,092 aggregated isolates used by hospitals to generate antibiograms, 921 (84% [95% CI = 82%-87%]) were susceptible to penicillin. With the exception of one hospital's erythromycin susceptibility results, hospital-specific S. pneumoniae susceptibilities to penicillin, cefotaxime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin from the two methods were statistically comparable. Although yielding fewer data than active surveillance, antibiograms provided accurate, community-specific drug-resistant S. pneumoniae data in Oregon.
0 Bad housekeeping: why do aphids leave their exuviae inside the colony? Animals can gain protection against predators and parasites by living in groups. The encounter-dilution effect provides protection when the probability of detection of a group does not increase in proportion to group size (i.e. encounter effect), so that predators do not offset the encounter effect by attacking more members of the group (i.e. dilution effect). In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism by which prey insects could gain by producing decoys that act as multiple targets for predators or parasitoids if these decoys are recognised as preys or hosts and negatively affect the patch foraging strategy of these predators and parasitoids. Such a decoy mechanism could be present in aphid colonies in which aphid exuviae are recognised and attacked by Aphidiine wasps. We conducted a behavioural study to evaluate the effect of exuviae on parasitoid patch residence time and egg allocation in experimental aphid patches with or without exuviae. We showed that exuviae are recognised and attacked at the same level as aphids when both are present in the patch. While parasitism rate was not significantly lower in patches with exuviae when the parasitoid left the patch, the time wasted by parasitoids to handle exuviae did influence the patch residence time. As a consequence, the attack rate on the live aphids was lower in patches that contain exuviae. Aphids had more time available to flee and thus each individual might gain protection against parasitoids by leaving their exuviae near and within the colony. These results demonstrate that the encounter-dilution effect provided by living in a group can be enhanced by extra-materials that act as decoy for natural enemies.
1 Spondylodiscitis complicated by the ingestion of a button battery: a case report. A one-and-a-half year old boy who presented with a cough, irritability, and refusal of food was found to have an impacted foreign body in his upper esophagus. We present the radiologic findings of the foreign body (a button battery) impacted in the upper esophagus and its complications; namely, mediastinitis and spondylodiscitis after endoscopic removal. Further, plain radiograph and MR imaging findings are discussed along with literature review.
3 Clinical and behavioral correlates of achieving and maintaining glycemic targets in an underserved population with type 2 diabetes. In an underserved Latino area, we established a disease-management program and proved its effectiveness. However, many patients still remained above target. This study was designed to evaluate which factors are associated with reaching program goals. This was a randomized, prospective, observational study in which patients enrolled in our program were followed for 2 years with outcomes, measures, and questionnaires assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months. Overall, A1C fell by 1%. Adherence to medication was the strongest predictor of reaching the target A1C of <8%; baseline A1C was also predictive. Knowledge scores increased in those who reached target, but the measures of self-efficacy and empowerment did not change for either group. Diabetes management is effective in a lower-income Latino population. However, adherence was suboptimal even when medications were provided on-site for free. Further research into barriers associated with medication adherence is needed.
0 Timing is critical for effective glucocorticoid receptor mediated repression of the cAMP-induced CRH gene. Glucocorticoid negative feedback of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis is mediated in part by direct repression of gene transcription in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expressing cells. We have investigated the cross talk between the two main signaling pathways involved in activation and repression of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA expression: cyclic AMP (cAMP) and GR. We report that in the At-T20 cell-line the glucocorticoid-mediated repression of the cAMP-induced human CRH proximal promoter activity depends on the relative timing of activation of both signaling pathways. Activation of the GR prior to or in conjunction with cAMP signaling results in an effective repression of the cAMP-induced transcription of the CRH gene. In contrast, activation of the GR 10 minutes after onset of cAMP treatment, results in a significant loss of GR-mediated repression. In addition, translocation of ligand-activated GR to the nucleus was found as early as 10 minutes after glucocorticoid treatment. Interestingly, while both signaling cascades counteract each other on the CRH proximal promoter, they synergize on a synthetic promoter containing 'positive' response elements. Since the order of activation of both signaling pathways may vary considerably in vivo, we conclude that a critical time-window exists for effective repression of the CRH gene by glucocorticoids.
2 Are pregnancy rates compromised following embryo freezing to prevent OHSS? To compare pregnancy rates with fresh and frozen embryo transfer in patients admitted to Royal Jubilee Maternity Service (RJMS), Belfast between January 1st 2004 and December 31st 2005 with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). A retrospective analysis of all ART cycles (2,283) carried out in RJMS between January 1st 2004 and December 31st 2005 and of all patients admitted to RJMS within 3 weeks of assisted reproduction therapy (ART). The incidence of OHSS requiring admission was 2.01%, which represented 80.70% of post-ART emergency admissions. The eventual pregnancy rate was 52.27% in all women admitted with OHSS. The pregnancy outcome in OHSS patients who received fresh embryo transfer was 56.52% and with frozen embryo transfer 50%. The main indications for fertility treatment in OHSS cases were male factor (31%) and polycystic ovarian syndrome (14%). Two distinct incidence peaks of OHSS were identified--early and late. 77.77% of women who suffered from late onset OHSS had a concurrent positive pregnancy test. The pregnancy rate in OHSS cases, both with fresh and subsequently with frozen embryo transfer, was exceptionally high. There was no statistically significant difference between fresh and frozen embryo transfer pregnancy rates. An elective embryo freezing policy to moderate the severity and duration of OHSS does not compromise outcome for women at risk of OHSS.
0 The rickettsia: an emerging group of pathogens in fish. Piscirickettsia salmonis is the first of the previously unrecognized rickettsial pathogens of fish to be fully characterized. Since the recognition of P. salmonis in 1989, the impact of rickettsial pathogens in fish has become increasingly apparent. Growing awareness of the emergence of these fastidious intracellular organisms has led to the discovery of rickettsial diseases among diverse species of fish from different geographic locations and aquatic environments. The source, reservoir, and mode of transmission of these agents as well as appropriate methods of disease prevention and control remain to be established.
0 Confusion and conflict in assessing the physical activity status of middle-aged men. Physical activity (including exercise) is prescribed for health and there are various recommendations that can be used to gauge physical activity status. The objective of the current study was to determine whether twelve commonly-used physical activity recommendations similarly classified middle-aged men as sufficiently active for general health. We examined the commonality in the classification of physical activity status between twelve variations of physical activity recommendations for general health in ninety men aged 45-64 years. Physical activity was assessed using synchronised accelerometry and heart rate. Using different guidelines but the same raw data, the proportion of men defined as active ranged from to 11% to 98% for individual recommendations (median 73%, IQR 30% to 87%). There was very poor absolute agreement between the recommendations, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (A,1) of 0.24 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.34). Only 8% of men met all 12 recommendations and would therefore be unanimously classified as active and only one man failed to meet every recommendation and would therefore be unanimously classified as not sufficiently active. The wide variability in physical activity classification was explained by ostensibly subtle differences between the 12 recommendations for thresholds related to activity volume (time or energy), distribution (e.g., number of days of the week), moderate intensity cut-point (e.g., 3 vs. 4 metabolic equivalents or METs), and duration (including bout length). Physical activity status varies enormously depending on the physical activity recommendation that is applied and even ostensibly small differences have a major impact. Approximately nine out of every ten men in the present study could be variably described as either active or not sufficiently active. Either the effective dose or prescription that underlies each physical activity recommendation is different or each recommendation is seeking the same prescriptive outcome but with variable success.
0 Host genes and HIV: the role of the chemokine receptor gene CCR5 and its allele. Since the late 1970s, 8.4 million people worldwide, including 1.7 million children, have died of AIDS, and an estimated 22 million people are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)(1). During 1995 and 1996, major clinical and laboratory discoveries regarding HIV pathogenesis provided new hope for the prevention and treatment of HIV infection. One major discovery was that members of the chemokine receptor family serve as cofactors for HIV entry into cells. We describe the role of allelic polymorphism in the gene coding for the CCR5 chemokine receptor with regard to susceptibility to and disease course of HIV infection. We also examine the effect of this discovery on medical and public health practices.
3 FGF9-induced proliferative response to eosinophilic inflammation in oesophagitis. Oesophagitis is characterised by basal cell hyperplasia and activated eosinophils, which release mediators including major basic protein (MBP). MBP and its mimetic polyarginine activate the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) on oesophageal epithelium. Fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) is implicated in epithelial homeostasis and proliferative response to injury, but has not been characterised in the oesophagus. To characterise FGF9 in oesophageal epithelium and oesophagitis, as the result of MBP activation of the CaSR. Human oesophageal epithelial cells (HET-1A) were used to compare affects of calcium, polyarginine and MBP-peptide on FGF9. HET-1A were transfected with interfering RNA (siRNA(CaSR)). FGF9, FGF receptors 2 and 3, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, BMP-4 and noggin mRNA expression were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. FGF9 was measured from HET-1A and from normal, gastro-oesophageal reflux and eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) patient biopsies using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. HET-1A proliferation was studied using bromodeoxyuridine and MTT. FGF9 was secreted by HET-1A cells treated with polyarginine and MBP-peptide, but not calcium. This effect was abrogated by siRNA(CaSR). FGF9 receptor mRNA was present. HET-1A cells proliferated following rhFGF9, but not MBP-peptide treatment, and rhFGF9 altered transcription of downstream proliferation-related genes (noggin, BMP-2 and BMP-4). FGF9 was increased in biopsies from patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis, which correlated with basal hyperplasia. Eosinophil-released MBP acts on the CaSR to increase FGF9 in oesophageal epithelial cells, leading to proliferation. Increased FGF9 is found in biopsies of EoE patients and may play a role in the pathogenesis of oesophagitis.
0 Influence of host genetics on the severity of coccidioidomycosis. Coccidioidomycosis, a mild flulike illness in approximately 40% of infected persons, progresses to severe pulmonary or disseminated disease in 1% to 10% of symptomatic cases. We examined host genetic influences on disease severity among class II HLA loci and the ABO blood group. Participants included African-American, Caucasian, and Hispanic persons with mild or severe disseminated coccidioidomycosis from Kern County, California. Among Hispanics, predisposition to symptomatic disease and severe disseminated disease is associated with blood types A and B, respectively. The HLA class II DRB1*1301 allele marks a pre-disposition to severe disseminated disease in each of the three groups. Reduced risk for severe disease is associated with DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201 among Caucasians and Hispanics and with DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 among African-Americans. These data support the hypothesis that host genes, in particular HLA class II and the ABO blood group, influence susceptibility to severe coccidioidomycosis.
0 The relationship between the left atrial volume and the maximum P-wave and P-wave dispersion in patients with congestive heart failure. A maximum P-wave duration (Pmax) of > or = 110 msec and a P-wave dispersion (PWD) > or = 40 msec are accepted indicators of a disturbance in interatrial conduction and an inhomogeneous propagation of the sinus impulse, respectively. The left atrial (LA) volume has been reported to be strongly associated with a systolic and diastolic dysfunction and is considered to be an index of atrial remodeling. We aimed to investigate the relationship between LA volume and Pmax or PWD in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Sixty-one patients with CHF were enrolled in this study. The study population was classified into four groups: two groups were divided according to the Pmax (> or = 110 msec or < 110 ms), and the other two groups were formed based on the PWD (> or = 40 msec or < 40 msec). The left atrial volume index (LAVi) was measured by three-dimensional (3-D) transthoracic echocardiography. The Pmax and PWD were measured from a 12-lead electrocardiogram. There were significant differences in the ejection fraction (EF), diastolic function, and LAVi between patients with a Pmax > or = 110 ms or a PWD > or = 40 ms and those with a Pmax < 110 ms or a PWD < 40 ms. The LAVi was independently associated with a disturbance in interatrial conduction and an inhomogeneous propagation of the sinus impulse. The LAVi can be used to identify patients with a disturbance in interatrial conduction and an inhomogeneous propagation of the sinus impulse with reasonably good accuracy. We concluded that a disturbance in interatrial conduction and an inhomogeneous propagation of the sinus impulse in patients with CHF is associated with an increase in the LA volume and a deleterious systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
0 Germ warfare in a microbial mat community: CRISPRs provide insights into the co-evolution of host and viral genomes. CRISPR arrays and associated cas genes are widespread in bacteria and archaea and confer acquired resistance to viruses. To examine viral immunity in the context of naturally evolving microbial populations we analyzed genomic data from two thermophilic Synechococcus isolates (Syn OS-A and Syn OS-B') as well as a prokaryotic metagenome and viral metagenome derived from microbial mats in hotsprings at Yellowstone National Park. Two distinct CRISPR types, distinguished by the repeat sequence, are found in both the Syn OS-A and Syn OS-B' genomes. The genome of Syn OS-A contains a third CRISPR type with a distinct repeat sequence, which is not found in Syn OS-B', but appears to be shared with other microorganisms that inhabit the mat. The CRISPR repeats identified in the microbial metagenome are highly conserved, while the spacer sequences (hereafter referred to as "viritopes" to emphasize their critical role in viral immunity) were mostly unique and had no high identity matches when searched against GenBank. Searching the viritopes against the viral metagenome, however, yielded several matches with high similarity some of which were within a gene identified as a likely viral lysozyme/lysin protein. Analysis of viral metagenome sequences corresponding to this lysozyme/lysin protein revealed several mutations all of which translate into silent or conservative mutations which are unlikely to affect protein function, but may help the virus evade the host CRISPR resistance mechanism. These results demonstrate the varied challenges presented by a natural virus population, and support the notion that the CRISPR/viritope system must be able to adapt quickly to provide host immunity. The ability of metagenomics to track population-level variation in viritope sequences allows for a culture-independent method for evaluating the fast co-evolution of host and viral genomes and its consequence on the structuring of complex microbial communities.
2 Delineation of VEGF-regulated genes and functions in the cervix of pregnant rodents by DNA microarray analysis. VEGF-regulated genes in the cervices of pregnant and non-pregnant rodents (rats and mice) were delineated by DNA microarray and Real Time PCR, after locally altering levels of or action of VEGF using VEGF agents, namely siRNA, VEGF receptor antagonist and mouse VEGF recombinant protein. Tissues were analyzed by genome-wide DNA microarray analysis, Real-time and gel-based PCR, and SEM, to decipher VEGF function during cervical remodeling. Data were analyzed by EASE score (microarray) and ANOVA (Real Time PCR) followed by Scheffe's F-test for multiple comparisons. Of the 30,000 genes analyzed, about 4,200 genes were altered in expression by VEGF, i.e., expression of about 2,400 and 1,700 genes were down- and up-regulated, respectively. Based on EASE score, i.e., grouping of genes according to their biological process, cell component and molecular functions, a number of vascular- and non-vascular-related processes were found to be regulated by VEGF in the cervix, including immune response (including inflammatory), cell proliferation, protein kinase activity, and cell adhesion molecule activity. Of interest, mRNA levels of a select group of genes, known to or with potential to influence cervical remodeling were altered. For example, real time PCR analysis showed that levels of VCAM-1, a key molecule in leukocyte recruitment, endothelial adhesion, and subsequent trans-endothelial migration, were elevated about 10 folds by VEGF. Further, VEGF agents also altered mRNA levels of decorin, which is involved in cervical collagen fibrillogenesis, and expression of eNO, PLC and PKC mRNA, critical downstream mediators of VEGF. Of note, we show that VEGF may regulate cervical epithelial proliferation, as revealed by SEM. These data are important in that they shed new insights in VEGF's possible roles and mechanisms in cervical events near-term, including cervical remodeling.
0 Adaptive mutations in the JC virus protein capsid are associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a progressive and mostly fatal demyelinating disease caused by JC virus infection and destruction of infected oligodendrocytes in multiple brain foci of susceptible individuals. While JC virus is highly prevalent in the human population, PML is a rare disease that exclusively afflicts only a small percentage of immunocompromised individuals including those affected by HIV (AIDS) or immunosuppressive drugs. Viral- and/or host-specific factors, and not simply immune status, must be at play to account for the very large discrepancy between viral prevalence and low disease incidence. Here, we show that several amino acids on the surface of the JC virus capsid protein VP1 display accelerated evolution in viral sequences isolated from PML patients but not in sequences isolated from healthy subjects. We provide strong evidence that at least some of these mutations are involved in binding of sialic acid, a known receptor for the JC virus. Using statistical methods of molecular evolution, we performed a comprehensive analysis of JC virus VP1 sequences isolated from 55 PML patients and 253 sequences isolated from the urine of healthy individuals and found that a subset of amino acids found exclusively among PML VP1 sequences is acquired via adaptive evolution. By modeling of the 3-D structure of the JC virus capsid, we showed that these residues are located within the sialic acid binding site, a JC virus receptor for cell infection. Finally, we go on to demonstrate the involvement of some of these sites in receptor binding by demonstrating a profound reduction in hemagglutination properties of viral-like particles made of the VP1 protein carrying these mutations. Collectively, these results suggest that a more virulent PML causing phenotype of JC virus is acquired via adaptive evolution that changes viral specificity for its cellular receptor(s).
0 Periodontitis as a risk factor for preterm low birth weight. There is growing evidence showing that a number of complex human diseases are caused or are at least influenced by periodontal diseases. Such diseases include cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis. The aim of study was to evaluate periodontal diseases as a risk factor for a preterm low birth weight. A total of 48 mothers, 20 of who had a preterm low birth weight delivery, were examined in the Clinics of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Cumhuriyet University. The periodontal exams consisted of a full mouth pocket depth, a Loe and Sillness Gingival index score measurements, and a panoramic radiograph analysis. Information on any other factors that may cause a preterm low birth weight was obtained from the family physician. The study results indicated that periodontitis (OR: 3.6 95% CI: 1.06-12.18) together with bacterial vaginosis (OR: 11.57 95% CI: 1.26-105.7) were independent risk factors of a preterm low birth weight. According to the data obtained from this study, the paternal age, tobacco use and the mothers' height were not significant risk factors for a preterm low birth weight. Within the limits of this study, it is concluded that a poor periodontal health status of the mother may be a potential risk factor for a preterm low birth weight.
3 Macrophage content in subcutaneous adipose tissue: associations with adiposity, age, inflammatory markers, and whole-body insulin action in healthy Pima Indians. In severely obese individuals and patients with diabetes, accumulation and activation of macrophages in adipose tissue has been implicated in the development of obesity-associated complications, including insulin resistance. We sought to determine whether in a healthy population, adiposity, sex, age, or insulin action is associated with adipose tissue macrophage content (ATMc) and/or markers of macrophage activation. Subcutaneous ATMc from young adult Pima Indians with a wide range of adiposity (13-46% body fat, by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and insulin action (glucose disposal rate 1.6-9 mg/kg estimated metabolic body size/min, by glucose clamp) were measured. We also measured expression in adipose tissue of factors implicated in macrophage recruitment and activation to determine any association with ATMc and insulin action. ATMc, as assessed by immunohistochemistry (Mphi) and by macrophage-specific gene expression (CD68, CD11b, and CSF1R), were correlated with percent body fat, age, and female sex. Gene expression of CD68, CD11b, and CSF1R but not Mphi was correlated negatively with glucose disposal rate but not after adjustment for percent body fat, age, and sex. However, adipose tissue expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) and CD11 antigen-like family member C (CD11c), markers produced by macrophages, were negatively correlated with adjusted glucose disposal rate (r = -0.28, P = 0.05 and r = -0.31, P = 0.03). ATMc is correlated with age and adiposity but not with insulin action independent of adiposity in healthy human subjects. However, PAI-1 and CD11c expression are independent predictors of insulin action, indicating a possible role for adipose tissue macrophage activation.
3 Resource shifts in Malagasy dung beetles: contrasting processes revealed by dissimilar spatial genetic patterns. The endemic dung beetle subtribe Helictopleurina has 65 species mostly in wet forests in eastern Madagascar. There are no extant native ungulates in Madagascar, but three Helictopleurus species have shifted to the introduced cattle dung in open habitats in the past 1500 years. Helictopleurus neoamplicollis and Helictopleurus marsyas exhibit very limited cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 haplotype diversity and a single haplotype is present across Madagascar, suggesting that these species shifted to cattle dung in a small region followed by rapid range expansion. In contrast, patterns of molecular diversity in Helictopleurus quadripunctatus indicate a gradual diet shift across most of southern Madagascar, consistent with somewhat broader diet in this species. The three cattle dung-using Helictopleurus species have significantly greater geographical ranges than the forest-dwelling species, apparently because the shift to the currently very abundant new resource relaxed interspecific competition that hinders range expansion in the forest species.
3 Household exposure to paint and petroleum solvents, chromosomal translocations, and the risk of childhood leukemia. Few studies have examined the association between home use of solvents and paint and the risk of childhood leukemia. In this case-control study, we examined whether the use of paint and petroleum solvents at home before birth and in early childhood influenced the risk of leukemia in children. We based our analyses on 550 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 100 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and one or two controls per case individually matched for sex, age, Hispanic status, and race. We conducted further analyses by cytogenetic subtype. We used conditional logistic regression techniques to adjust for income. ALL risk was significantly associated with paint exposure [odds ratio (OR) = 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.26-2.15], with a higher risk observed when paint was used postnatally, by a person other than the mother, or frequently. The association was restricted to leukemia with translocations between chromosomes 12 and 21 (OR = 4.16; 95% CI, 1.66-10.4). We found no significant association between solvent use and ALL risk overall (OR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.87-1.51) or for various cytogenetic subtypes, but we observed a significant association in the 2.0- to 5.9-year age group (OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.07-2.25). In contrast, a significant increased risk for AML was associated with solvent (OR = 2.54; 95% CI, 1.19-5.42) but not with paint exposure (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.32-1.25). The association of ALL risk with paint exposure was strong, consistent with a causal relationship, but further studies are needed to confirm the association of ALL and AML risk with solvent exposure.
1 Novel measures of cardiovascular health and its association with prevalence and progression of age-related macular degeneration: the CHARM Study. To determine if novel measures of cardiovascular health are associated with prevalence or progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Measures of the cardiovascular system: included intima media thickness (IMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV), systemic arterial compliance (SAC), carotid augmentation index (AI). For the prevalence study, hospital-based AMD cases and population-based age- and gender-matched controls with no signs of AMD in either eye were enrolled. For the progression component, participants with early AMD were recruited from two previous studies; cases were defined as progression in one or both eyes and controls were defined as no progression in either eye. 160 cases and 160 controls were included in the prevalence component. The upper two quartiles of SAC, implying good cardiovascular health, were significantly associated with increased risk of AMD (OR = 2.54, 95% CL = 1.29, 4.99). High PWV was associated with increased prevalent AMD. Progression was observed in 82 (32.3%) of the 254 subjects recruited for the progression component. Higher AI (worse cardiovascular function) was protective for AMD progression (OR = 0.30, 95%CL = 0.13, 0.69). Higher aortic PWV was associated with increased risk of AMD progression; the highest risk was seen with the second lowest velocity (OR = 6.22, 95% CL = 2.35, 16.46). The results were unexpected in that better cardiovascular health was associated with increased risk of prevalent AMD and progression. Inconsistent findings between the prevalence and progression components could be due to truly different disease etiologies or to spurious findings, as can occur with inherent biases in case control studies of prevalence. Further investigation of these non-invasive methods of characterizing the cardiovascular system should be undertaken as they may help to further elucidate the role of the cardiovascular system in the etiology of prevalent AMD and progression.
0 Differentials of fertility in North and South Gondar zones, northwest Ethiopia: a comparative cross-sectional study. Ethiopia is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa with an estimated population of 77.1 million in mid-2007. Uncontrolled fertility has adversely influenced the socio-economic, demographic and environmental situations of the country. It is one of the largest and poorest countries that, even in the midst of crisis, has maintained high levels of fertility. This study was aimed at investigating the most important factors influencing fertility behavior in Northwest Ethiopia. A comparative cross-sectional study which included 2424 women aged 25 years and above was undertaken in the Amhara region of Northwest Ethiopia. The study subjects were grouped into high fertile and low fertile categories. There were 1011 and 1413 women in the high and low fertile groups, respectively. A multi-stage cluster sampling stratified by place of residence was employed to select the required study subjects. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression techniques were used to analyze the data. Among the 25 variables considered in this study, only 9 of them were found significantly and independently associated with the level of fertility. Women with at least secondary education were at a lower risk of high fertility with OR = 0.37 (95% CI: 0.21 to 0.64) compared to those with no formal education. However, women with primary education did not show any significant difference when compared with the same baseline group. Age at first marriage was inversely associated with the number of children ever born alive. Place of residence, household expenditure, number of children who have died, attitude towards using contraceptives, women's knowledge on the safe period, and current marital status were the other variables that showed significant associations with the level of fertility. Female education beyond the primary level, reduced infant and child mortality, delayed marriage and correct knowledge on the safe period during the menstrual cycle were amongst the main factors that had a bearing on high fertility.
1 Population-based study on the prevalence and risk factors of orthostatic hypotension in subjects with pre-diabetes and diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pre-diabetes and orthostatic hypotension and to examine the prevalence and correlates of orthostatic hypotension in community dwellers with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), pre-diabetes, and diabetes. All participants were classified as having NGT (n = 1,069), pre-diabetes (n = 412), or diabetes (n = 157). Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a decline in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of > or =20/10 mmHg when an individual changed from a supine to a standing position. The cardiovagal response to standing was the ratio between the longest RR interval around beat 30 and the shortest RR interval around beat 15 after standing (30 max-to-15 min ratio). The prevalences of orthostatic hypotension were 13.8, 17.7, and 25.5% in subjects with NGT, pre-diabetes, and diabetes, respectively. For all subjects, age, diabetes, hypertension, and a decreased 30 max-to-15 min ratio, but not pre-diabetes, were independently associated with orthostatic hypotension. Age, hypertension, and 30 max-to-15 min ratio were the correlates of orthostatic hypotension in NGT subjects. Age and hypertension were related to orthostatic hypotension in pre-diabetic subjects. A1C and hypertension were the determinants of orthostatic hypotension in diabetic subjects. Supine blood pressure was related to orthostatic hypotension in all subjects and subgroups. Pre-diabetic subjects do not have a higher risk of orthostatic hypotension than subjects with NGT, although the risk of orthostatic hypotension is higher in diabetic subjects. Hypertension and supine blood pressure were risk factors for orthostatic hypotension in both pre-diabetic and diabetic subjects. Age and A1C were the correlates of orthostatic hypotension in pre-diabetic and diabetic subjects, respectively. The cardiovagal response to standing is an important determinant of orthostatic hypotension in subjects with NGT but not in pre-diabetic and diabetic subjects.
0 Differential replication dynamics for large and small Vibrio chromosomes affect gene dosage, expression and location. Replication of bacterial chromosomes increases copy numbers of genes located near origins of replication relative to genes located near termini. Such differential gene dosage depends on replication rate, doubling time and chromosome size. Although little explored, differential gene dosage may influence both gene expression and location. For vibrios, a diverse family of fast growing gammaproteobacteria, gene dosage may be particularly important as they harbor two chromosomes of different size. Here we examined replication dynamics and gene dosage effects for the separate chromosomes of three Vibrio species. We also investigated locations for specific gene types within the genome. The results showed consistently larger gene dosage differences for the large chromosome which also initiated replication long before the small. Accordingly, large chromosome gene expression levels were generally higher and showed an influence from gene dosage. This was reflected by a higher abundance of growth essential and growth contributing genes of which many locate near the origin of replication. In contrast, small chromosome gene expression levels were low and appeared independent of gene dosage. Also, species specific genes are highly abundant and an over-representation of genes involved in transcription could explain its gene dosage independent expression. Here we establish a link between replication dynamics and differential gene dosage on one hand and gene expression levels and the location of specific gene types on the other. For vibrios, this relationship appears connected to a polarisation of genetic content between its chromosomes, which may both contribute to and be enhanced by an improved adaptive capacity.
1 Maximising response rates in household telephone surveys. Epidemiological and other studies that require participants to respond by completing a questionnaire face the growing threat of non-response. Response rates to household telephone surveys are diminishing because of changes in telecommunications, marketing and culture. Accordingly, updated information is required about the rate of telephone listing in directories and optimal strategies to maximise survey participation. A total of 3426 households in Sydney, Australia were approached to participate in a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) regarding their domestic (recycled and/or drinking) water usage. Only randomly selected households in the suburb and postcode of interest with a telephone number listed in the Electronic White Pages (EWP) that matched Australian electoral records were approached. The CATI response rate for eligible households contacted by telephone was 39%. The rate of matching of electoral and EWP records, a measure of telephone directory coverage, was 55%. The use of a combination of approaches, such as an advance letter, interviewer training, establishment of researcher credentials, increasing call attempts and targeted call times, remains a good strategy to maximise telephone response rates. However, by way of preparation for future technological changes, reduced telephone number listings and people's increasing resistance to unwanted phone calls, alternatives to telephone surveys, such as internet-based approaches, should be investigated.
2 The effect of different suturing techniques on astigmatism after penetrating keratoplasty. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects on astigmatism after penetrating keratoplasty with three different suture techniques. In this prospective study, 38 eyes of 38 patients underwent penetrating keratoplasty with three suturing techniques: interrupted, single running, and double running. Topographic astigmatism was measured at 2, 6, 12, and 18 months after keratoplasty. During 18 months after surgery, the interrupted suture group had higher astigmatism than the double running suture group. There was no significant difference in the amounts of astigmatism during the first year after keratoplasty between the single running and the double running suture group. However, at 18 months after surgery, when all sutures were out, the double running suture group (3.60+/-1.58 diopters) showed significantly less astigmatism than the single running group (5.65+/-1.61 diopters). In conclusion, post-keratoplasty astigmatism was the least in the double running suture group of the three suturing techniques at 18 months after penetrating keratoplasty.
3 Altered energy homeostasis and resistance to diet-induced obesity in KRAP-deficient mice. Obesity and related metabolic disorders have become leading causes of adult morbidity and mortality. KRAP (Ki-ras-induced actin-interacting protein) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein and a ubiquitous protein among tissues, originally identified as a cancer-related molecule, however, its physiological roles remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that KRAP-deficient (KRAP(-/-)) mice show enhanced metabolic rate, decreased adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, hypoinsulinemia and hypoleptinemia. KRAP(-/-) mice are also protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance despite of hyperphagia. Notably, glucose uptake in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in KRAP(-/-) mice is enhanced in an insulin-independent manner, suggesting that BAT is involved in altered energy homeostasis in KRAP(-/-) mice, although UCP (Uncoupling protein) expressions are not altered. Of interest is the down-regulation of fatty acid metabolism-related molecules, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)-1, ACC-2 and fatty acid synthase in the liver of KRAP(-/-) mice, which could in part account for the metabolic phenotype in KRAP(-/-) mice. Thus, KRAP is a novel regulator in whole-body energy homeostasis and may be a therapeutic target in obesity and related diseases.
2 Power Doppler imaging in acute renal vein occlusion and recanalization: a canine model. To evaluate the dynamic changes of the power Doppler (PD) in acute renal vein occlusion and recanalization in a canine model. We performed a PD of the kidney during graded renal vein occlusion and recanalization induced by balloon inflation and deflation in nine dogs. The PD images were transferred to a personal computer, and the PD signals were quantified. We observed the temporal change of the PD signal during renal vein occlusion and recanalization, with a decrease in the PD signal during occlusion and an increase during recanalization. The mean PD signal decreased gradually as the renal vein was occluded, and conversely increased gradually with sequential relief of occlusion. The sequential change of the mean value of the PD signal was statistically significant. The PD can detect a change in renal blood flow during acute renal vein occlusion and recanalization in a canine model. The PD may be used as a helpful tool for the early detection of acute renal vein thrombosis and the monitoring of renal perfusion.
3 Parasites of importance for human health in Nigerian dogs: high prevalence and limited knowledge of pet owners. Dogs are the most common pet animals worldwide. They may harbour a wide range of parasites with zoonotic potential, thus causing a health risk to humans. In Nigeria, epidemiological knowledge on these parasites is limited. In a community-based study, we examined 396 dogs in urban and rural areas of Ilorin (Kwara State, Central Nigeria) for ectoparasites and intestinal helminths. In addition, a questionnaire regarding knowledge and practices was applied to pet owners. Nine ectoparasite species belonging to four taxa and six intestinal helminth species were identified: fleas (Ctenocephalides canis, Pulex irritans, Tunga penetrans), mites (Demodex canis, Otodectes sp., Sarcoptes scabiei var. canis), ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Ixodes sp.), and lice (Trichodectes canis); and Toxocara canis, Ancylostoma sp., Trichuris vulpis, Dipylidium caninum, Taenidae and Strongyloides sp. Overall prevalence of ectoparasites was 60.4% and of intestinal helminths 68.4%. The occurrence of C. canis, R. sanguineus, T. canis, Ancylostoma sp. and T. vulpis was most common (prevalence 14.4% to 41.7%). Prevalence patterns in helminths were age-dependent, with T. canis showing a decreasing prevalence with age of host, and a reverse trend in other parasite species. Knowledge regarding zoonoses was very limited and the diseases not considered a major health problem. Treatment with antiparasitic drugs was more frequent in urban areas. Parasites of importance for human health were highly prevalent in Nigerian dogs. Interventions should include health education provided to dog owners and the establishment of a program focusing on zoonotic diseases.
0 The class E floral homeotic protein SEPALLATA3 is sufficient to loop DNA in 'floral quartet'-like complexes in vitro. The organs of a eudicot flower are specified by four functional classes, termed class A, B, C and E, of MADS domain transcription factors. The combinatorial formation of tetrameric complexes, so called 'floral quartets', between these classes is widely believed to represent the molecular basis of floral organ identity specification. As constituents of all complexes, the class E floral homeotic proteins are thought to be of critical relevance for the formation of floral quartets. However, experimental support for tetrameric complex formation remains scarce. Here we provide physico-chemical evidence that in vitro homotetramers of the class E floral homeotic protein SEPALLATA3 from Arabidopsis thaliana bind cooperatively to two sequence elements termed 'CArG boxes' in a phase-dependent manner involving DNA looping. We further show that the N-terminal part of SEPALLATA3 lacking K3, a subdomain of the protein-protein interactions mediating K domain, and the C-terminal domain, is sufficient for protein dimerization, but not for tetramer formation and cooperative DNA binding. We hypothesize that the capacity of class E MADS domain proteins to form tetrameric complexes contributes significantly to the formation of floral quartets. Our findings further suggest that the spacing and phasing of CArG boxes are important parameters in the molecular mechanism by which floral homeotic proteins achieve target gene specificity.
3 Nuclear envelope remnants: fluid membranes enriched in sterols and polyphosphoinositides. The cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is a highly dynamic compartment where membranes readily undergo fission and fusion to reorganize the cytoplasmic architecture, and to import, export and transport various cargos within the cell. The double membrane of the nuclear envelope that surrounds the nucleus, segregates the chromosomes from cytoplasm and regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport through pores. Many details of its formation are still unclear. At fertilization the sperm devoid of nuclear envelope pores enters the egg. Although most of the sperm nuclear envelope disassembles, remnants of the envelope at the acrosomal and centriolar fossae do not and are subsequently incorporated into the newly forming male pronuclear envelope. Remnants are conserved from annelid to mammalian sperm. Using lipid mass spectrometry and a new application of deuterium solid-state NMR spectroscopy we have characterized the lipid composition and membrane dynamics of the sperm nuclear envelope remnants in isolated sperm nuclei. We report nuclear envelope remnants are relatively fluid membranes rich in sterols, devoid of sphingomyelin, and highly enriched in polyphosphoinositides and polyunsaturated phospholipids. The localization of the polybasic effector domain of MARCKS illustrates the non-nuclear aspect of the polyphosphoinositides. Based on their atypical biophysical characteristics and phospholipid composition, we suggest a possible role for nuclear envelope remnants in membrane fusion leading to nuclear envelope assembly.
1 Is replication the gold standard for validating genome-wide association findings? With the advent of genome-wide association (GWA) studies, researchers are hoping that reliable genetic association of common human complex diseases/traits can be detected. Currently, there is an increasing enthusiasm about GWA and a number of GWA studies have been published. In the field a common practice is that replication should be used as the gold standard to validate an association finding. In this article, based on empirical and theoretical data, we emphasize that replication of GWA findings can be quite difficult, and should not always be expected, even when true variants are identified. The probability of replication becomes smaller with the increasing number of independent GWA studies if the power of individual replication studies is less than 100% (which is usually the case), and even a finding that is replicated may not necessarily be true. We argue that the field may have unreasonably high expectations on success of replication. We also wish to raise the question whether it is sufficient or necessary to treat replication as the ultimate and gold standard for defining true variants. We finally discuss the usefulness of integrating evidence from multiple levels/sources such as genetic epidemiological studies (at the DNA level), gene expression studies (at the RNA level), proteomics (at the protein level), and follow-up molecular and cellular studies for eventual validation and illumination of the functional relevance of the genes uncovered.
1 Advanced gastric cancer and perfusion imaging using a multidetector row computed tomography: correlation with prognostic determinants. To investigate the relationship between the perfusion CT features and the clinicopathologically determined prognostic factors in advanced gastric cancer cases. A perfusion CT was performed on 31 patients with gastric cancer one week before surgery using a 16-channel multi-detector CT (MDCT) instrument. The data were analyzed with commercially available software to calculate tumor blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), and permeability surface (PS). The microvessel density (MVD), was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of the surgical specimens with anti-CD34. All of the findings were analyzed prospectively and correlated with the clinicopathological findings, which included histological grading, presence of lymph node metastasis, serosal involvement, distant metastasis, tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging, and MVD. The statistical analyses used included the Student's t-test and the Spearman rank correlation were performed in SPSS 11.5. The mean perfusion values and MVD for tumors were as follows: BF (48.14+/-16.46 ml/100 g/min), BV (6.70+/-2.95 ml/100 g), MTT (11.75+/-4.02 s), PS (14.17+/-5.23 ml/100 g/min) and MVD (41.7+/-11.53). Moreover, a significant difference in the PS values was found between patients with or without lymphatic involvement (p = 0.038), as well as with different histological grades (p = 0.04) and TNM stagings (p = 0.026). However, BF, BV, MTT, and MVD of gastric cancer revealed no significant relationship with the clinicopathological findings described above (p > 0.05). The perfusion CT values of the permeable surface could serve as a useful prognostic indicator in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
0 A naturally occurring mutation in ropB suppresses SpeB expression and reduces M1T1 group A streptococcal systemic virulence. Epidemiological studies of group A streptococcus (GAS) have noted an inverse relationship between SpeB expression and invasive disease. However, the role of SpeB in the course of infection is still unclear. In this study we utilize a SpeB-negative M1T1 clinical isolate, 5628, with a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB, to elucidate the role of RopB and SpeB in systemic virulence. Allelic exchange mutagenesis was used to replace the mutated ropB allele in 5628 with the intact allele from the well characterized isolate 5448. The inverse allelic exchange was also performed to replace the intact ropB in 5448 with the mutated allele from 5628. An intact ropB was found to be essential for SpeB expression. While the ropB mutation was shown to have no effect on hemolysis of RBC's, extracellular DNase activity or survival in the presence of neutrophils, strains with the mutated ropB allele were less virulent in murine systemic models of infection. An isogenic SpeB knockout strain containing an intact RopB showed similarly reduced virulence. Microarray analysis found genes of the SpeB operon to be the primary target of RopB regulation. These data show that an intact RopB and efficient SpeB production are necessary for systemic infection with GAS.
1 An epididymis-specific secretory protein HongrES1 critically regulates sperm capacitation and male fertility. Mammalian sperm capacitation is an essential prerequisite to fertilizion. Although progress had been made in understanding the physiology and biochemistry of capacitation, little is known about the potential roles of epididymal proteins during this process. Here we report that HongrES1, a new member of the SERPIN (serine proteinase inhibitor) family exclusively expressed in the rat cauda epididymis and up-regulated by androgen, is secreted into the lumen and covers the sperm head. Co-culture of caudal sperms with HongrES1 antibody in vitro resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of capacitated spermatozoa. Furthermore, the percentage of capacitated spermatozoa clearly increased in rats when HongrES1 was down-regulated by RNAi in vivo. Remarkably, knockdown of HongrES1 in vivo led to reduced fertility accompanied with deformed appearance of fetuses and pups. These results identify HongrES1 as a novel and critical molecule in the regulation of sperm capacitation and male fertility.
1 Site-specific GlcNAcylation of human erythrocyte proteins: potential biomarker(s) for diabetes. O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is upregulated in diabetic tissues and plays a role in insulin resistance and glucose toxicity. Here, we investigated the extent of GlcNAcylation on human erythrocyte proteins and compared site-specific GlcNAcylation on erythrocyte proteins from diabetic and normal individuals. GlcNAcylated erythrocyte proteins or GlcNAcylated peptides were tagged and selectively enriched by a chemoenzymatic approach and identified by mass spectrometry. The enrichment approach was combined with solid-phase chemical derivatization and isotopic labeling to detect O-GlcNAc modification sites and to compare site-specific O-GlcNAc occupancy levels between normal and diabetic erythrocyte proteins. The enzymes that catalyze the cycling (addition and removal) of O-GlcNAc were detected in human erythrocytes. Twenty-five GlcNAcylated erythrocyte proteins were identified. Protein expression levels were compared between diabetic and normal erythrocytes. Thirty-five O-GlcNAc sites were reproducibly identified, and their site-specific O-GlcNAc occupancy ratios were calculated. GlcNAcylation is differentially regulated at individual sites on erythrocyte proteins in response to glycemic status. These data suggest not only that site-specific O-GlcNAc levels reflect the glycemic status of an individual but also that O-GlcNAc site occupancy on erythrocyte proteins may be eventually useful as a diagnostic tool for the early detection of diabetes.
3 Complete obliteration of a basilar artery aneurysm after insertion of a self-expandable Leo stent into the basilar artery without coil embolization. We report a case of a 45-year-old man who underwent endovascular treatment in the acute setting of a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a wide-necked basilar trunk aneurysm. The patient was treated with stent implantation without coiling. A control angiographic scan obtained immediately after the procedure revealed significantly decreased intraaneurysmal flow. Follow-up angiography performed after one month demonstrated total aneurysm occlusion.
1 Development and validation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies against Mycobacterium bovis in European wild boar. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) remains a significant problem in some parts of Spain largely because of contacts between cattle and wildlife reservoirs in extensive grazing systems. European Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is one of the species involved in the transmission of the disease to other species. Fast and simple detection methods would be critical for assessing infection prevalence, study the mechanisms of pathogen transmission and monitoring the effects of TB control measures. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies against Mycobacterium bovis in wild boar serum was developed and validated on 185 sera from TB positive and negative wild boar. Based on antigen inoculation of captive animals as well as tuberculosis compatible lesions, culture results and molecular analysis of hunted individuals, animals were allocated into two groups: tuberculosis positive group and tuberculosis negative group. After optimization of the positive to negative ratio using different combinations of serum dilutions and conjugate concentrations, the test yielded a sensitivity of 72.60% and a specificity of 96.43% for the best cut-off. Although some negative group animals showed an ELISA positive reaction (< 3%), this assay showed a high potential for accurate diagnosis of TB in wild boar, as its large dynamic range supported a good discriminatory power and a satisfactory balance between sensitivity and specificity.
3 Associations between PM2.5 and heart rate variability are modified by particle composition and beta-blocker use in patients with coronary heart disease. It has been hypothesized that ambient particulate air pollution is able to modify the autonomic nervous control of the heart, measured as heart rate variability (HRV). Previously we reported heterogeneous associations between particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 microm (PM2.5) and HRV across three study centers. We evaluated whether exposure misclassification, effect modification by medication, or differences in particle composition could explain the inconsistencies. Subjects with coronary heart disease visited clinics biweekly in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Erfurt, Germany; and Helsinki, Finland for 6-8 months. The standard deviation (SD) of NN intervals on an electrocardiogram (ECG; SDNN) and high frequency (HF) power of HRV was measured with ambulatory ECG during paced breathing. Outdoor levels of PM2.5 were measured at a central site. In Amsterdam and Helsinki, indoor and personal PM2.5 were measured during the 24 hr preceding the clinic visit. PM2.5 was apportioned between sources using principal component analyses. We analyzed associations of indoor/personal PM2.5, elements of PM2.5, and source-specific PM2.5 with HRV using linear regression. Indoor and personal PM2.5 were not associated with HRV. Increased outdoor PM2.5 was associated with decreased SDNN and HF at lags of 2 and 3 days only among persons not using beta-blocker medication. Traffic-related PM2.5 was associated with decreased SDNN, and long-range transported PM2.5 with decreased SDNN and HF, most strongly among persons not using beta blockers. Indicators for PM2.5 from traffic and long-range transport were also associated with decreased HRV. Our results suggest that differences in the composition of particles, beta-blocker use, and obesity of study subjects may explain some inconsistencies among previous studies on HRV.
3 A framework for integrated environmental health impact assessment of systemic risks. Traditional methods of risk assessment have provided good service in support of policy, mainly in relation to standard setting and regulation of hazardous chemicals or practices. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that many of the risks facing society are systemic in nature - complex risks, set within wider social, economic and environmental contexts. Reflecting this, policy-making too has become more wide-ranging in scope, more collaborative and more precautionary in approach. In order to inform such policies, more integrated methods of assessment are needed. Based on work undertaken in two large EU-funded projects (INTARESE and HEIMTSA), this paper reviews the range of approaches to assessment now in used, proposes a framework for integrated environmental health impact assessment (both as a basis for bringing together and choosing between different methods of assessment, and extending these to more complex problems), and discusses some of the challenges involved in conducting integrated assessments to support policy. Integrated environmental health impact assessment is defined as a means of assessing health-related problems deriving from the environment, and health-related impacts of policies and other interventions that affect the environment, in ways that take account of the complexities, interdependencies and uncertainties of the real world. As such, it depends heavily on how issues are selected and framed, and implies the involvement of stakeholders both in issue-framing and design of the assessment, and to help interpret and evaluate the results. It is also a comparative process, which involves evaluating and comparing different scenarios. It consequently requires the ability to model the way in which the influences of exogenous factors, such as policies or other interventions, feed through the environment to affect health. Major challenges thus arise. Chief amongst these are the difficulties in ensuring effective stakeholder participation, in dealing with the multicausal and non-linear nature of many of the relationships between environment and health, and in taking account of adaptive and behavioural changes that characterise the systems concerned.
2 Pulmonary edema after catastrophic carbon dioxide embolism during laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure used both for diagnosis and for various treatments. A rare but sometimes fatal complication of laparoscopy is pulmonary embolism with CO2 resulting in pulmonary edema. During laparoscopic gynecological surgery in a 29-year-old woman who had previously undergone lower abdominal surgery, the end-tidal CO2 suddenly increased from 40 mmHg to 85 mmHg and then decreased to 13 mmHg with hemodynamic deterioration. These events are characteristic of a CO2 embolism. When this occurred, CO2 insufflation was immediately stopped and the patient was resuscitated. The patient's condition gradually improved with aggressive treatment, but the clinical course was complicated by bilateral pulmonary edema. This case of pulmonary edema was soon resolved with supportive management. The formation of a CO2 embolism during laparoscopy must be suspected whenever there is a sudden change in the end-tidal CO2. In addition, the possibility of pulmonary edema should be considered when a CO2 embolism occurs.
1 Semi-automatic measurement of the airway dimension by computed tomography using the full-width-half-maximum method: a study on the measurement accuracy according to the CT parameters and size of the airway. To assess the influence of variable factors such as the size of the airway and the CT imaging parameters such as the reconstruction kernel, field-of-view (FOV), and slice thickness on the automatic measurement of airway dimension. An airway phantom was fabricated that contained eleven poly-acryl tubes of various lumen diameters and wall thicknesses. The measured density of the poly-acryl wall was 150 HU, and the measured density of the airspace filled with polyurethane foam was -900 HU. CT images were obtained using a 16-MDCT (multidetector CT) scanner and were reconstructed with various reconstruction kernels, thicknesses and FOV. The luminal radius and wall thickness were measured using in-house software based on the full-width-half-maximum method. The measured values as determined by CT and the actual dimensions of the tubes were compared. Measurements were most accurate on images reconstructed with use of a standard kernel (mean error: -0.03 +/- 0.21 mm for wall thickness and -0.12 +/- 0.11 mm for the luminal radius). There was no significant difference in accuracy among images with the use of variable slice thicknesses or a variable FOV. Below a 1-mm threshold, the measurement failed to represent the change of the real dimensions. Measurement accuracy was strongly influenced by the specific reconstruction kernel utilized. For accurate measurement, standardization of the imaging protocol and selection of the appropriate anatomic level are essential.
3 Human cytomegalovirus IE1 protein enhances herpes simplex virus type 1-induced syncytial formation in U373MG cells. Co-infection of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is not uncommon in immunocompromised hosts. Importantly, organ transplant recipients concurrently infected with HSV-1 and HCMV have a worse clinical outcome than recipients infected with a single virus. However, factors regulating the pathologic response in HSV-1, HCMV co-infected tissues are unclear. We investigated the potential biologic role of HCMV gene product immediate early 1 (IE1) protein in HSV-1-induced syncytial formation in U373MG cells. We utilized a co-infection model by infecting HSV-1 to U373MG cells constitutively expressing HCMV IE1 protein, UMG1-2. Syncytial formation was assessed by enumerating nuclei number per syncytium and number of syncytia. HSV-1-induced syncytial formation was enhanced after 24 hr in UMG1-2 cells compared with U373MG controls. The amplified phenotype in UMG1-2 cells was effectively suppressed by roscovitine in addition to inhibitors of viral replication. This is the first study to provide histological evidence of the contribution of HCMV IE1 protein to enhanced cytopathogenic responses in active HSV-1 infection.
3 Valproate, a mood stabilizer, induces WFS1 expression and modulates its interaction with ER stress protein GRP94. Valproate is a standard treatment for bipolar disorder and a first-line mood stabilizer. The molecular mechanisms underlying its actions in bipolar disorder are unclear. It has been suggested that the action of valproate is linked to changes in gene expression and induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-response proteins. Here we show that valproate modulates the ER stress response through the regulation of WFS1, an important component for mitigating ER stress. Therapeutic concentrations of valproate induce expression of WFS1 mRNA and activate the WFS1 promoter. In addition, WFS1 forms a complex with GRP94, an ER stress-response protein, in which valproate dose-dependently enhances its dissociation from GRP94. These results suggest that the therapeutic effects of valproate in bipolar disorder may be mediated by WFS1 expression and its dissociation from GRP94.
0 An unusual helix turn helix motif in the catalytic core of HIV-1 integrase binds viral DNA and LEDGF. Integrase (IN) of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) catalyzes the integration of viral DNA into host cellular DNA. We identified a bi-helix motif (residues 149-186) in the crystal structure of the catalytic core (CC) of the IN-Phe185Lys variant that consists of the alpha(4) and alpha(5) helices connected by a 3 to 5-residue turn. The motif is embedded in a large array of interactions that stabilize the monomer and the dimer. We describe the conformational and binding properties of the corresponding synthetic peptide. This displays features of the protein motif structure thanks to the mutual intramolecular interactions of the alpha(4) and alpha(5) helices that maintain the fold. The main properties are the binding to: 1- the processing-attachment site at the LTR (long terminal repeat) ends of virus DNA with a K(d) (dissociation constant) in the sub-micromolar range; 2- the whole IN enzyme; and 3- the IN binding domain (IBD) but not the IBD-Asp366Asn variant of LEDGF (lens epidermal derived growth factor) lacking the essential Asp366 residue. In our motif, in contrast to the conventional HTH (helix-turn-helix), it is the N terminal helix (alpha(4)) which has the role of DNA recognition helix, while the C terminal helix (alpha(5)) would rather contribute to the motif stabilization by interactions with the alpha(4) helix. The motif, termed HTHi (i, for inverted) emerges as a central piece of the IN structure and function. It could therefore represent an attractive target in the search for inhibitors working at the DNA-IN, IN-IN and IN-LEDGF interfaces.
0 Identification of STRA6 and SKI sequence variants in patients with anophthalmia/microphthalmia. Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (A/M) are rare congenital ocular malformations presenting with the absence of eye components or small eyes with or without structural abnormalities. A/M can be isolated or syndromic. The stimulated by retinoic acid gene 6 (STRA6) and Sloan-Kettering viral oncogene homolog (SKI) genes are involved in vitamin A metabolism, and are implicated with A/M developmental abnormalities in human and animal studies. Vitamin A metabolism is vital to normal eye development and growth. This study explores the association of these genes in a cohort of subjects with A/M. STRA6 and SKI were screened for sequence variants by direct sequencing of genomic DNA samples from 18 affected subjects with A/M. The DNA samples of 4 external, unrelated controls were initially screened. Eighty-nine additional unrelated controls were screened to confirm that any sequence variants found in the affected subject DNA samples were related to the phenotype. Coding regions, intron-exon boundaries, and untranslated regions were sequenced by standard techniques. Derived DNA sequences were compared to known reference sequences from public genomic databases. For STRA6, a novel coding non-synonymous sequence variant was found in one subject, resulting in an amino acid change from glycine to glutamic acid in residue 217. One novel nonsense sequence variant found in the same subject changed the STRA6 amino acid residue 592 from cytosine to thymine resulting in a premature stop codon. For SKI, a known coding non-synonymous sequence variant (rs28384811) was found in 3 subject DNA samples and 11/89 control DNA samples. Four novel coding-synonymous sequence variants were observed in SKI. The STRA6 sequence variants reported in this study could play a role in the pathogenesis of A/M by structural changes to the STRA6 protein. We can attribute 4% A/M incidence in this cohort to these sequence variants. Although no SKI sequence variants were found in this cohort, SKI should not be ruled out as a candidate gene for A/M due to the small cohort size.
2 Efficacy assessment of sustained intraperitoneal paclitaxel therapy in a murine model of ovarian cancer using bioluminescent imaging. We evaluated the pre-clinical efficacy of a novel intraperitoneal (i.p.) sustained-release paclitaxel formulation (PTX(ePC)) using bioluminescent imaging (BLI) in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Human ovarian carcinoma cells stably expressing the firefly luciferase gene (SKOV3(Luc)) were injected i.p. into SCID mice. Tumour growth was evaluated during sustained or intermittent courses of i.p. treatment with paclitaxel (PTX). In vitro bioluminescence strongly correlated with cell survival and cytotoxicity. Bioluminescent imaging detected tumours before their macroscopic appearance and strongly correlated with tumour weight and survival. As compared with intermittent therapy with Taxol, sustained PTX(ePC) therapy resulted in significant reduction of tumour proliferation, weight and BLI signal intensity, enhanced apoptosis and increased survival times. Our results demonstrate that BLI is a useful tool in the pre-clinical evaluation of therapeutic interventions for ovarian cancer. Moreover, these results provide evidence of enhanced therapeutic efficacy with the sustained PTX(ePC) implant system, which could potentially translate into successful clinical outcomes.
1 Reproducibility of computer-aided detection marks in digital mammography. To evaluate the performance and reproducibility of a computeraided detection (CAD) system in mediolateral oblique (MLO) digital mammograms taken serially, without release of breast compression. A CAD system was applied preoperatively to the fullfield digital mammograms of two MLO views taken without release of breast compression in 82 patients (age range: 33-83 years; mean age: 49 years) with previously diagnosed breast cancers. The total number of visible lesion components in 82 patients was 101: 66 masses and 35 microcalcifications. We analyzed the sensitivity and reproducibility of the CAD marks. The sensitivity of the CAD system for first MLO views was 71% (47/66) for masses and 80% (28/35) for microcalcifications. The sensitivity of the CAD system for second MLO views was 68% (45/66) for masses and 17% (6/35) for microcalcifications. In 84 ipsilateral serial MLO image sets (two patients had bilateral cancers), identical images, regardless of the existence of CAD marks, were obtained for 35% (29/84) and identical images with CAD marks were obtained for 29% (23/78). Identical images, regardless of the existence of CAD marks, for contralateral MLO images were 65% (52/80) and identical images with CAD marks were obtained for 28% (11/39). The reproducibility of CAD marks for the true positive masses in serial MLO views was 84% (42/50) and that for the true positive microcalcifications was 0% (0/34). The CAD system in digital mammograms showed a high sensitivity for detecting masses and microcalcifications. However, reproducibility of microcalcification marks was very low in MLO views taken serially without release of breast compression. Minute positional change and patient movement can alter the images and result in a significant effect on the algorithm utilized by the CAD for detecting microcalcifications.
0 Nevirapine resistance and breast-milk HIV transmission: effects of single and extended-dose nevirapine prophylaxis in subtype C HIV-infected infants. Daily nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis to HIV-exposed infants significantly reduces breast-milk HIV transmission. We assessed NVP-resistance in Indian infants enrolled in the "six-week extended-dose nevirapine" (SWEN) trial who received single-dose NVP (SD-NVP) or SWEN for prevention of breast-milk HIV transmission but who also acquired subtype C HIV infection during the first year of life. Standard population sequencing and cloning for viral subpopulations present at > or =5% frequency were used to determine HIV genotypes from 94% of the 79 infected Indian infants studied. Timing of infection was defined based on when an infant's blood sample first tested positive for HIV DNA. SWEN-exposed infants diagnosed with HIV by six weeks of age had a significantly higher prevalence of NVP-resistance than those who received SD-NVP, by both standard population sequencing (92% of 12 vs. 38% of 29; p = 0.002) and low frequency clonal analysis (92% of 12 vs. 59% of 29; p = 0.06). Likelihood of infection with NVP-resistant HIV through breast-milk among infants infected after age six weeks was substantial, but prevalence of NVP-resistance did not differ among SWEN or SD-NVP exposed infants by standard population sequencing (15% of 13 vs. 15% of 20; p = 1.00) and clonal analysis (31% of 13 vs. 40% of 20; p = 0.72). Types of NVP-resistance mutations and patterns of persistence at one year of age were similar between the two groups. NVP-resistance mutations did differ by timing of HIV infection; the Y181C variant was predominant among infants diagnosed in the first six weeks of life, compared to Y188C/H during late breast-milk transmission. Use of SWEN to prevent breast-milk HIV transmission carries a high likelihood of resistance if infection occurs in the first six weeks of life. Moreover, there was a continued risk of transmission of NVP-resistant HIV through breastfeeding during the first year of life, but did not differ between SD-NVP and SWEN groups. As with SD-NVP, the value of preventing HIV infection in a large number of infants should be considered alongside the high risk of resistance associated with extended NVP prophylaxis.

2 Clinical evaluation of accommodative intraocular lens implantation in high myopic eyes. To compare the clinical outcome of AT-45 implantation between high myopic eyes and non-high myopic eyes. Retrospective, non-randomized, comparative trial. The medical charts of 28 patients with 35 eyes who had phacoemulsification and AT-45 implantation were retrospectively reviewed. 13 eyes of 10 patients were included in the high myopic group (axial length > or = 26.0 mm) and 22 eyes of 18 patients were included in the non-high myopic group. The clinical data included unilateral best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at 6 months follow-up after the surgery. The results were compared between the two groups. In the non-high myopic group, 22 eyes (100%) and 19 eyes (86.4%) achieved a BCVA of 20/25 and 20/20 or better respectively. For the high myopic group, the results were 13 eyes (100%) and 12 eyes (92.3%) respectively, at 6 months after the surgery. In the non-high myopic group, 21 (95.4%) and 7 eyes (31.8%) achieved a DCNVA of 20/40 and 20/25 or better. For the high myopic group, the results were 13 (100%) and 4 eyes (30.8%) respectively, at 6 months after the surgery, the differences between the two groups for a BCVA of 20/25 or better and 20/20 or better and a DCNVA 20/40 or better and 20/25 or better were not statistically significant. Six months clinical outcome of cataract surgery with an AT-45 for the high myopic eyes was satisfactory; it was not significantly different from that of the non-high myopic eyes.
0 Lentiviral vectors containing an enhancer-less ubiquitously acting chromatin opening element (UCOE) provide highly reproducible and stable transgene expression in hematopoietic cells. Ubiquitously acting chromatin opening elements (UCOEs) consist of methylation-free CpG islands encompassing dual divergently transcribed promoters of housekeeping genes that have been shown to confer resistance to transcriptional silencing and to produce consistent and stable transgene expression in tissue culture systems. To develop improved strategies for hematopoietic cell gene therapy, we have assessed the potential of the novel human HNRPA2B1-CBX3 UCOE (A2UCOE) within the context of a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector. Unlike viral promoters, the enhancer-less A2UCOE gave rise to populations of cells that expressed a reporter transgene at a highly reproducible level. The efficiency of expression per vector genome was also markedly increased in vivo compared with vectors incorporating either spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters, suggesting a relative resistance to silencing. Furthermore, an A2UCOE-IL2RG vector fully restored the IL-2 signaling pathway within IL2RG-deficient human cells in vitro and successfully rescued the X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) phenotype in a mouse model of this disease. These data indicate that the A2UCOE displays highly reliable transcriptional activity within a lentiviral vector, largely overcoming insertion-site position effects and giving rise to therapeutically relevant levels of gene expression. These properties are achieved in the absence of classic enhancer activity and therefore may confer a high safety profile.
0 Exudative pharyngitis possibly due to Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, a new challenge in the differential diagnosis of diphtheria. Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum has rarely been reported to cause disease in humans, despite its common presence in the flora of the upper respiratory tract. We report here a case of exudative pharyngitis with pseudomembrane possibly caused by C. pseudodiphtheriticum in a 4-year-old girl. The case initially triggered clinical and laboratory suspicion of diphtheria. Because C. pseudodiphtheriticum can be easily confused with Corynebacterium diphtheriae in Gram stain, clarification of its role in the pathogenesis of exudative pharyngitis in otherwise healthy persons is of public health importance. Simple and rapid screening tests to differentiate C. pseudodiphtheriticum from C. diphtheriae should be performed to prevent unnecessary concern in the community and unnecessary outbreak control measures.
2 Degeneration of acetabular articular cartilage to bipolar hemiarthroplasty. This study examined the rate of degeneration of acetabular cartilage by the bipolar head according to time, and also which clinical factors are related to the degeneration of acetabular cartilage. Among 192 patients (226 hip joints) who received bipolar hemiarthroplasty from August 1996 to August 2002, 61 patients (65 hip joints) were enrolled in this study, who were followed up for more than 2 years and showed no signs of dislocation, infection, or functional problems. A modified form of a computer assisted vector wear analysis program was used to measure the rate of degeneration of the acetabular cartilage. The factors that appeared to affect the rate of acetabular degeneration in the two groups was evaluated. The average linear degenerative change in the acetabular cartilage and the volumetric degenerative change were 0.23 +/- 0.107mm/year and 114 +/- 47.2mm3/year, respectively. The result showed significant differences in activity and HHS between the 2 groups. The HHS showed a reverse relationship with the linear degeneration and volumetric degeneration, and the activity showed a correlation with the linear and volumetric degeneration. The acetabular cartilage degenerates faster as the patient' activity increases, and slower with a higher HHS. When surgeons perform hip joint arthroplasty, it is strongly recommended that the life expectancy and the level of activity should be considered when deciding between a hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty.
0 QTLs of factors of the metabolic syndrome and echocardiographic phenotypes: the hypertension genetic epidemiology network study. In a previous study of the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) we have shown that metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors were moderately and significantly associated with echocardiographic (ECHO) left ventricular (LV) phenotypes. The study included 1,393 African Americans and 1,133 whites, stratified by type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) status. Heritabilities of seven factor scores based on the analysis of 15 traits were sufficiently high to pursue QTL discovery in this follow-up study. Three of the QTLs discovered relate to combined MetS-ECHO factors of "blood pressure (BP)-LV wall thickness" on chromosome 3 at 225 cM with a 2.8 LOD score, on chromosome 20 at 2.1 cM with a 2.6 LOD score; and for "LV wall thickness" factor on chromosome 16 at 113.5 with a 2.6 LOD score in whites. The remaining QTLs include one for a "body mass index-insulin (BMI-INS)" factor with a LOD score of 3.9 on chromosome 2 located at 64.8 cM; one for the same factor on chromosome 12 at 91.4 cM with a 3.3 LOD score; one for a "BP" factor on chromosome 19 located at 67.8 cM with a 3.0 LOD score. A suggestive linkage was also found for "Lipids-INS" with a 2.7 LOD score located on chromosome 11 at 113.1 cM in African Americans. Of the above QTLs, the one on chromosome 12 for "BMI-INS" is replicated in both ethnicities, (with highest LOD scores in African Americans). In addition, the QTL for "LV wall thickness" on chromosome 16q24.2-q24.3 reached its local maximum LOD score at marker D16S402, which is positioned within the 5th intron of the cadherin 13 gene, implicated in heart and vascular remodeling. Our previous study and this follow-up suggest gene loci for some crucial MetS and cardiac geometry risk factors that contribute to the risk of developing heart disease.
2 Ethanol embolotherapy of pelvic arteriovenous malformations: an initial experience. We retrospectively assessed the results of performing ethanol embolization for pelvis arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). During the past 10 years, eight patients (8 females, age range: 27-52 years) with AVMs in the pelvic wall (n = 3) and uterus (n = 5) underwent staged ethanol embolizations (range: 1-5, mean: 2.5) under general anesthesia. Ethanol embolization was performed by the use of the transcatheter and/or direct puncture techniques. Clinical follow-up was performed for all of the patients, and imaging follow-up was available for seven patients. The therapeutic outcomes were established by evaluating the clinical outcome of the signs and symptoms, as well as the degree of devascularization observed on post-procedural angiography. During the 20 sessions of ethanol embolization, the solitary transarterial approach was used 14 times, the transvenous approach was used three times and direct puncture was used once. For two patients, the transarterial and transvenous or direct puncture approaches were used together in one session. For four patients, ethanol and coils were used as embolic agents, and n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and ethanol were used in one patient. Seven (88%) of eight patients were cured of their AVMs and one patient (12%) displayed improvement. Major complications were seen in two patients (25%). Ethanol embolization is effective for the treatment of pelvic arteriovenous malformations, though there is a chance of a major complication.
0 IL2RA/CD25 gene polymorphisms: uneven association with multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). IL-2 receptor (IL2R) alpha is the specific component of the high affinity IL2R system involved in the immune response and in the control of autoimmunity. Here we perform a replication and fine mapping of the IL2RA gene region analyzing 3 SNPs previously associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 5 SNPs associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a collection of 798 MS patients and 927 matched Caucasian controls from the south of Spain. We observed association with MS in 6 of 8 SNPs. The rs1570538, at the 3'- UTR extreme of the gene, previously reported to have a weak association with MS, is replicated here (P = 0.032). The most associated T1D SNP (rs41295061) was not associated with MS in the present study. However, the rs35285258, belonging to another independent group of SNPs associated with T1D, showed the maximal association in this study but different risk allele. We replicated the association of only one (rs2104286) of the two IL2RA SNPs identified in the recently performed genome-wide association study of MS. These findings confirm and extend the association of this gene with MS and reveal a genetic heterogeneity of the associated polymorphisms and risk alleles between MS and T1D suggesting different immunopathological roles of IL2RA in these two diseases.
2 Intra-operative measurement of surgical lengths of the rectum and the peritoneal reflection in Korean. The lengths of the surgical rectum and peritoneal reflection were important factors in treatment modality of rectal tumor. To evaluate the surgical length of rectum, we measured the length of the peritoneal reflections, sacral promontory and termination of the taenia coli from the anal verge by rigid sigmoidoscope in 23 male and 23 females during operation. The mean lengths of the sacral promontory were 16.5+/- 2.2 cm and 16.1+/-2.2 cm in the males and females, respectively. As for the peritoneal reflection, the results were anterior (8.8+/-2.2 cm, 8.1+/-1.7 cm), lateral (10.8+/-2.7 cm, 11.4+/-1.9 cm) and posterior (13.8+/-2.5 cm, 14.0+/-1.9 cm), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between male and female. And only height had a correlation with the length of sacral promontory both in male and female (p=0.015 and p=0.018, respectively). For all the estimated lengths, the length of the sacral promontory had a correlation with the lengths of the anterior (p<0.001 and p=0.001) and posterior (p<0.001 and p<0.001) peritoneal reflections in males and females, respectively. We suggest that the intra-operative lengths of the rectum and peritoneal reflection will be useful information for treatment modality of rectal tumor clinically in Korean.
3 Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in a Chilean patient with recent travel in Bolivia. A case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was serologically confirmed in a critically ill patient in Santiago, Chile. The patient's clinical course had many similarities to that of other HPS patients in North and South America but was complicated by acute severe renal failure. The patient's history included self-reported urban and probable rural rodent exposure during travel in Bolivia. Comparison of a viral sequence from an acute-phase serum sample with other known hantaviruses showed that the hantavirus nucleic acid sequence from the patient was very similar to a virus recently isolated from rodents associated with HPS cases in Paraguay.
0 The p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase as a central nervous system drug discovery target. Protein kinases are critical modulators of a variety of cellular signal transduction pathways, and abnormal phosphorylation events can be a cause or contributor to disease progression in a variety of disorders. This has led to the emergence of protein kinases as an important new class of drug targets for small molecule therapeutics. A serine/threonine protein kinase, p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), is an established therapeutic target for peripheral inflammatory disorders because of its critical role in regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production. There is increasing evidence that p38alpha MAPK is also an important regulator of proinflammatory cytokine levels in the central nervous system, raising the possibility that the kinase may be a drug discovery target for central nervous system disorders where cytokine overproduction contributes to disease progression. Development of bioavailable, central nervous system-penetrant p38alpha MAPK inhibitors provides the required foundation for drug discovery campaigns targeting p38alpha MAPK in neurodegenerative disorders.
2 Adjuvant 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid vs observation for pancreatic cancer: composite data from the ESPAC-1 and -3(v1) trials. The ESPAC-1, ESPAC-1 plus, and early ESPAC-3(v1) results (458 randomized patients; 364 deaths) were used to estimate the effectiveness of adjuvant 5FU/FA vs resection alone for pancreatic cancer using meta-analysis. The pooled hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI=0.55-0.88) P=0.003, and the median survival of 23.2 (95% CI=20.1-26.5) months with 5FU/FA vs 16.8 (95% CI=14.3-19.2) months with resection alone supports the use of adjuvant 5FU/FA in pancreatic cancer.
1 Evaluation of an in silico predicted specific and immunogenic antigen from the OmcB protein for the serodiagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections. The OmcB protein is one of the most immunogenic proteins in C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae infections. This protein is highly conserved leading to serum cross reactivity between the various chlamydial species. Since previous studies based on recombinant proteins failed to identify a species specific immune response against the OmcB protein, this study evaluated an in silico predicted specific and immunogenic antigen from the OmcB protein for the serodiagnosis of C. trachomatis infections. Using the ClustalW and Antigenic programs, we have selected two predicted specific and immunogenic regions in the OmcB protein: the N-terminal (Nt) region containing three epitopes and the C-terminal (Ct) region containing two epitopes with high scores. These regions were cloned into the PinPoint Xa-1 and pGEX-6P-1 expression vectors, incorporating a biotin purification tag and a glutathione-S-transferase tag, respectively. These regions were then expressed in E. coli. Only the pGEX-6P-1 has been found suitable for serological studies as its tag showed less cross reactivity with human sera and was retained for the evaluation of the selected antigens. Only the Ct region of the protein has been found to be well expressed in E. coli and was evaluated for its ability to be recognized by human sera. 384 sera were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies to C. trachomatis by our in house microimmunofluorescence (MIF) and the developed ELISA test. Using the MIF as the reference method, the developed OmcB Ct ELISA has a high specificity (94.3%) but a low sensitivity (23.9). Our results indicate that the use of the sequence alignment tool might be useful for identifying specific regions in an immunodominant antigen. However, the two epitopes, located in the selected Ct region, of the 24 predicted in the full length OmcB protein account for approximately 25% of the serological response detected by MIF, which limits the use of the developed ELISA test when screening C. trachomatis infections. The developed ELISA test might be used as a confirmatory test to assess the specificity of serological results found by MIF.
3 Histone deacetylase inhibitors: a new mode for inhibition of cholesterol metabolism. Eukaryotic gene expression is a complex process involving multiple cis and trans activating molecules to either facilitate or inhibit transcription. In recent years, many studies have focused on the role of acetylation of histone proteins in modulating transcription, whereas deacetylation of these same proteins is associated with inactivation or repression of gene expression. This study explores gene expression in HepG2 and F9 cell lines treated with Trichostatin A (TSA), a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor. These experiments show that TSA treatment results in clear repression of genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway as well as other associated pathways including fatty acid biosynthesis and glycolysis. TSA down regulates 9 of 15 genes in this pathway in the F9 embryonal carcinoma model and 11 of 15 pathway genes in the HepG2 cell line. A time course study on the effect of TSA on gene expression of various enzymes and transcription factors involved in these pathways suggests that down regulation of Srebf2 may be the triggering factor for down regulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Our results provide new insights in the effects of histone deacetylases on genes involved in primary metabolism. This observation suggests that TSA, and other related histone deacetylase inhibitors, may be useful as potential therapeutic entities for the control of cholesterol levels in humans.
2 Case report: femtosecond laser-assisted small incision deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty. To report two cases of femtosecond laser-assisted small incision deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK) for patients with corneal endothelial decompensation by Fuchs dystrophy and glaucoma Femtosecond laser (IntraLase; IntraLase Corp., Irvine, CA) with 15 kHz of repetition rate, was used for a 9.5 mm diameter by 400 micrometer thickness donor corneal lamellar dissection. In Case 1, the graft was clear and compact without interface haze, Orbscan showed smooth and regular corneal surface, specular microscopy was unremarkable without sign of corneal endothelial damage, and Optical coherence tomography showed uniform graft well attached to recipient stroma with minimal interface reflection at 2 months postoperation. In Case 2, the graft was clear and compact with minimal interface haze at 1 month postoperation. Femtosecond laser-assisted small incision DLEK was safe and technically feasible in our cases; however, further evaluation is required to determine long-term effects.
0 Genetic variation stimulated by epigenetic modification. Homologous recombination is essential for maintaining genomic integrity. A common repair mechanism, it uses a homologous or homeologous donor as a template for repair of a damaged target gene. Such repair must be regulated, both to identify appropriate donors for repair, and to avoid excess or inappropriate recombination. We show that modifications of donor chromatin structure can promote homology-directed repair. These experiments demonstrate that either the activator VP16 or the histone chaperone, HIRA, accelerated gene conversion approximately 10-fold when tethered within the donor array for Ig gene conversion in the chicken B cell line DT40. VP16 greatly increased levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4, while tethered HIRA did not affect histone acetylation, but caused an increase in local nucleosome density and levels of histone H3.3. Thus, epigenetic modification can stimulate genetic variation. The evidence that distinct activating modifications can promote similar functional outcomes suggests that a variety of chromatin changes may regulate homologous recombination, and that disregulation of epigenetic marks may have deleterious genetic consequences.
1 Dispensary level pilot implementation of rapid diagnostic tests: an evaluation of RDT acceptance and usage by providers and patients--Tanzania, 2005. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may assist in diagnosis, improve prescribing practices and reduce potential drug resistance development. Without understanding operational issues or acceptance and usage by providers and patients, the costs of these tests may not be justified. To evaluate the impact of RDTs on prescribing behaviours, assess prescribers' and patients' perceptions, and identify operational issues during implementation. Baseline data were collected at six Tanzanian public dispensaries. RDTs were implemented for eight weeks and data collected on frequency of RDT use, results, malaria diagnoses and the prescription of antimalarials. Patients referred for RDTs completed a standardised exit interview. Qualitative methods assessed attitudes toward and satisfaction with RDTs, perceptions about the test and operational issues related to implementation. Of 595 patients at baseline, 200 (33%) were diagnosed clinically with malaria but had a negative RDT. Among the 2519 RDTs performed during implementation, 289 (11.5%) had a negative result and antimalarials prescribed. The proportion of "over-prescriptions" at baseline was 54.8% (198/365). At weeks four and eight this decreased to 16.1% (27/168) and 16.4% (42/256) respectively.A total of 355 patient or parent/caregiver and 21 prescriber individual interviews and 12 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted. Patients, caregivers and providers trusted RDT results, agreed that use of RDTs was feasible at dispensary level, and perceived that RDTs improved clinical diagnosis. Negative concerns included community suspicion and fear that RDTs were HIV tests, the need for additional supervision in interpreting the results, and increased work loads without added compensation. Overprescriptions decreased over the study period. There was a high degree of patient/caregiver and provider acceptance of and satisfaction with RDTs. Implementation should include community education, sufficient levels of training and supervision and consideration of the need for additional staff.
2 Is radiation superior to indomethacin to prevent heterotopic ossification in acetabular fractures?: a systematic review. Heterotopic ossification is a well-known complication after fixation of an acetabular fracture. Indomethacin and radiation therapy are used as prophylaxis to prevent heterotopic ossification. It is unclear, however, whether either is superior, although this may relate to lack of power in individual studies. To compare the effectiveness of indomethacin with the effectiveness of radiation therapy, we conducted a systematic review in which all published prospective studies were evaluated. We performed a literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register. The retrieved studies were analyzed and categorized according to the quality and validity score of Jadad et al. We found five appropriate prospective studies, describing 384 patients. Although the quality of the available studies made a proper meta-analysis inappropriate, the incidence of heterotopic ossification was significantly lower in patients treated with radiation than in patients receiving indomethacin (five of 160 versus 20 of 224, respectively). Until further information is available, we believe the evidence supports radiation therapy as the preferred method for preventing heterotopic ossification after operative treatment of acetabular fractures. Level II, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
1 Bayesian optimal discovery procedure for simultaneous significance testing. In high throughput screening, such as differential gene expression screening, drug sensitivity screening, and genome-wide RNAi screening, tens of thousands of tests need to be conducted simultaneously. However, the number of replicate measurements per test is extremely small, rarely exceeding 3. Several current approaches demonstrate that test statistics with shrinking variance estimates have more power over the traditional t statistic. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to incorporate the shrinkage concept by introducing a mixture structure on variance components. The estimates from the Bayesian model are utilized in the optimal discovery procedure (ODP) proposed by Storey in 2007, which was shown to have optimal performance in multiple significance tests. We compared the performance of the Bayesian ODP with several competing test statistics. We have conducted simulation studies with 2 to 6 replicates per gene. We have also included test results from two real datasets. The Bayesian ODP outperforms the other methods in our study, including the original ODP. The advantage of the Bayesian ODP becomes more significant when there are few replicates per test. The improvement over the original ODP is based on the fact that Bayesian model borrows strength across genes in estimating unknown parameters. The proposed approach is efficient in computation due to the conjugate structure of the Bayesian model. The R code (see Additional file 1) to calculate the Bayesian ODP is provided.
2 Demographic and clinical factors associated with response to smallpox vaccine in preimmunized volunteers. In March 2003, the French Ministry of Health implemented a program on preparedness and response to a biological attack using smallpox as weapon. This program included the establishment of a preoutbreak national team that could be revaccinated against smallpox. To identify demographic and clinical factors associated with vaccination success defined as the presence of a pustule at the inoculation site at day 8 (days 7-9), with an undiluted vaccinia virus derived from a Lister strain among preimmunized volunteers. From March 2003 to November 2006, we have studied prospectively 226 eligible volunteers. Demographic data were recorded for each volunteer (age, sex, number of previously smallpox vaccinations and date of the last vaccination). Smallpox vaccine adverse reactions were diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination performed at days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after revaccination. A total of 226 volunteers (sex ratio H/F = 2.7) were revaccinated. Median age was 45 years (range: 27-63 yrs). All volunteers completed follow-up. Median number of vaccinations before revaccination was 2 (range: 1-8). The median delay between time of the study and the last vaccination was 29 years (range; 18-60 yrs). Sixty-one volunteers (27%) experienced one (n = 40) or more (n = 21) minor side effects during the 2-14 days after revaccination. Successful vaccination was noted in 216/226 volunteers (95.6%) at day 8 and the median of the pustule diameter was 5 mm (range: 1-20 mm). Size of the pustule at day 8 was correlated with age (p = 0.03) and with the presence of axillary adenopathy after revaccination (p = 0.007). Sex, number of prior vaccinations, delay between the last vaccination and revaccination, and local or systemic side effects with the exception of axillary adenopathy, were not correlated with the size of the pustule at day 8. Previously vaccinated volunteers can be successfully revaccinated with the Lister strain.
1 Implementation of seven echocardiographic parameters of myocardial asynchrony to improve the long-term response rate of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Cardiac resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is an effective therapy for chronic heart failure with beneficial hemodynamic effects leading to a reduction of morbidity and mortality. The responder rates, however, are low. There are various and contentious echocardiographic parameters of myocardial asynchrony. Patient selection by echocardiographic assessment of asynchrony is thought to improve responder rates. In this small single-center pilot-study, seven established parameters of myocardial asynchrony were used to select patients for CRT: (1) interventricular electromechanical delay (IMD, cut-off > or = 40 ms), (2) Septal-to-posterior wall motion delay (SPWMD, > or = 130 ms), (3) maximal difference in time-to-peak velocities between any two of twelve LV segments (Ts-12 > or = 104 ms), (4) standard deviation of time to peak myocardial velocities (Ts-12-SD, > or = 34.4 ms), (5) difference between the septal and basal time-to-peak velocity (TDId, > or = 60 ms), (6) left ventricular electromechanical delay (LVEMD, > 140 ms) and (7) delayed longitudinal contraction (DLC, > 2 segments).16 chronic heart failure patients (NYHA III-IV, LVEF < 0.35, QRS > or = 120 ms) at least two out of seven parameters of myocardial asynchrony received cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-ICD). Follow-up echo examination was after 6 months. The control group was a historic group of CRT patients (n = 38) who had not been screened for echocardiographic signs of myocardial asynchrony prior to device implantation. Based on reverse remodeling (relative reduction of LVESV > 15%, relative increase of LVEF > 25%), the responder rate to CRT was 81.2% in patients selected for CRT according to our protocol as compared to 47.4% in the control group (p = 0.04). At baseline, there were on average 4.1 +/- 1.6 positive parameters of asynchrony (follow-up: 3.7 [+/- 1.6] parameters positive, p = 0.52). Only the LVEMD decreased significantly after CRT (p = 0.027). The remaining parameters showed a non-significant trend towards reduction of myocardial asynchrony. The implementation of different markers of asynchrony in the selection process for CRT improves the hemodynamic response rate to CRT.
3 High-fidelity correction of genomic uracil by human mismatch repair activities. Deamination of cytosine to produce uracil is a common and potentially mutagenic lesion in genomic DNA. U*G mismatches occur spontaneously throughout the genome, where they are repaired by factors associated with the base excision repair pathway. U*G mismatches are also the initiating lesion in immunoglobulin gene diversification, where they undergo mutagenic processing by redundant pathways, one dependent upon uracil excision and the other upon mismatch recognition by MutS alpha. While UNG is well known to initiate repair of uracil in DNA, the ability of MutS alpha to direct correction of this base has not been directly demonstrated. Using a biochemical assay for mismatch repair, we show that MutS alpha can promote efficient and faithful repair of U*G mismatches, but does not repair U*A pairs in DNA. This contrasts with UNG, which readily excises U opposite either A or G. Repair of U*G by MutS alpha depends upon DNA polymerase delta (pol delta), ATP, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), all properties of canonical mismatch repair. These results show that faithful repair of U*G can be carried out by either the mismatch repair or base excision repair pathways. Thus, the redundant functions of these pathways in immunoglobulin gene diversification reflect their redundant functions in faithful repair. Faithful repair by either pathway is comparably efficient, suggesting that mismatch repair and base excision repair share the task of faithful repair of genomic uracil.
0 Pore loops of the AAA+ ClpX machine grip substrates to drive translocation and unfolding. Proteolytic AAA+ unfoldases use ATP hydrolysis to power conformational changes that mechanically denature protein substrates and then translocate the polypeptide through a narrow pore into a degradation chamber. We show that a tyrosine residue in a pore loop of the hexameric ClpX unfoldase links ATP hydrolysis to mechanical work by gripping substrates during unfolding and translocation. Removal of the aromatic ring in even a few ClpX subunits results in slippage, frequent failure to denature the substrate and an enormous increase in the energetic cost of substrate unfolding. The tyrosine residue is part of a conserved aromatic-hydrophobic motif, and the effects of mutations in both residues vary with the nucleotide state of the resident subunit. These results support a model in which nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in these pore loops drive substrate translocation and unfolding, with the aromatic ring transmitting force to the polypeptide substrate.
0 Temporal and individual variation in offspring provisioning by tree swallows: a new method of automated nest attendance monitoring. Studies of the ecology and evolution of avian nesting behavior have been limited by the difficulty and expense of sampling nest attendance behavior across entire days or throughout a substantial portion of the nestling period. Direct observation of nesting birds using human observers and most automated devices requires sub-sampling of the nestling period, which does not allow for the quantification of the duration of chick-feeding by parents within a day, and may also inadequately capture temporal variation in the rate at which chicks are fed. Here I describe an inexpensive device, the Automated Perch Recorder (APR) system, which collects accurate, long-term data on hourly rates of nest visitation, the duration of a pair's workday, and the total number of visits the pair makes to their nest across the entire period for which it is deployed. I also describe methods for verifying the accuracy of the system in the field, and several examples of how these data can be used to explore the causes of variation in and tradeoffs between the rate at which birds feed their chicks and the total length of time birds spend feeding chicks in a day.
1 Identification of two novel OPA1 mutations in Chinese families with autosomal dominant optic atrophy. To report the clinical features and identification of two novel mutations in two Chinese pedigrees with autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA). Two families (F1 and F2) including ten affected members and nine unaffected family individuals were examined clinically. After informed consent was obtained, peripheral blood samples of all the participants were obtained, and genomic DNA was extracted. Linkage analysis was performed with two microsatellite markers around the OPA1 gene (D3S2305 and D3S3562) in family F1. The coding region (exon 1-28), including intron-exon boundary of the OPA1 gene, were screened in the 2 families by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing. Whenever substitutions were identified in a patient, single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed on all available family members and 100 normal controls. To characterize a splicing site mutation, RT-PCR of total RNA of leukocytes obtained from three patients and seven unaffected individuals of family F1 was performed with the specific primers. The affected individuals all presented with bilateral visual failure and temporal or total pallor of the optic discs. Genotyping of family F1 revealed the linkage to the OPA1 gene on 3q28-29. After sequencing of OPA1 gene, a novel heterozygous splicing site mutation c.985 -2A>G in intron 9 was found in family F1. RT-PCR result showed the skipping of the exon 10 in the mutant transcript, which results in loss of 27 amino acids in the OPA1 protein. A novel heterozygous nonsense mutation c.2197C>T(p.R733X)was detected in family F2. Our findings expand the spectrum of OPA1 mutations and further established the role of OPA1 gene in Chinese patients with ADOA.
1 Learning to prescribe - pharmacists' experiences of supplementary prescribing training in England. The introduction of non-medical prescribing for professions such as pharmacy and nursing in recent years offers additional responsibilities and opportunities but attendant training issues. In the UK and in contrast to some international models, becoming a non-medical prescriber involves the completion of an accredited training course offered by many higher education institutions, where the skills and knowledge necessary for prescribing are learnt. to explore pharmacists' perceptions and experiences of learning to prescribe on supplementary prescribing (SP) courses, particularly in relation to inter-professional learning, course content and subsequent use of prescribing in practice. A postal questionnaire survey was sent to all 808 SP registered pharmacists in England in April 2007, exploring demographic, training, prescribing, safety culture and general perceptions of SP. After one follow-up, 411 (51%) of pharmacists responded. 82% agreed SP training was useful, 58% agreed courses provided appropriate knowledge and 62% agreed that the necessary prescribing skills were gained. Clinical examination, consultation skills training and practical experience with doctors were valued highly; pharmacology training and some aspects of course delivery were criticised. Mixed views on inter-professional learning were reported - insights into other professions being valued but knowledge and skills differences considered problematic. 67% believed SP and recent independent prescribing (IP) should be taught together, with more diagnostic training wanted; few pharmacists trained in IP, but many were training or intending to train. There was no association between pharmacists' attitudes towards prescribing training and when they undertook training between 2004 and 2007 but earlier cohorts were more likely to be using supplementary prescribing in practice. Pharmacists appeared to value their SP training and suggested improvements that could inform future courses. The benefits of inter-professional learning, however, may conflict with providing profession-specific training. SP training may be perceived to be an instrumental 'stepping stone' in pharmacists' professional project of gaining full IP status.
0 Genome plasticity of Vibrio parahaemolyticus: microevolution of the 'pandemic group'. Outbreak of V. parahaemolyticus infections occurred since 1996 was linked to a proposed clonal complex, the pandemic group. The whole genome sequence provides an unprecedented opportunity for dissecting genome plasticity and phylogeny of the populations of V. parahaemolyticus. In the present work, a whole-genome cDNA microarray was constructed to compare the genomic contents of a collection of 174 strains of V. parahaemolyticus. Genes that present variably in the genome accounted for about 22% of the whole gene pool on the genome. The phylogenetic analysis of microarray data generated a minimum spanning tree that depicted the phylogenetic structure of the 174 strains. Strains were assigned into five complexes (C1 to C5), and those in each complex were related genetically and phylogenetically. C3 and C4 represented highly virulent clinical clones. C2 and C3 constituted two different clonal complexes 'old-O3:K6 clone' and 'pandemic clone', respectively. C3 included all the 39 pandemic strains tested (trh-, tdh+ and GS-PCR+), while C2 contained 12 pre-1996 'old' O3:K6 strains (trh+, tdh- and GS-PCR-) tested herein. The pandemic clone (post-1996 'new' O3:K6 and its derivates O4:K68, O1:K25, O1:KUT and O6:K18) might be emerged from the old-O3:K6 clone, which was promoted by acquisition of toxRS/new sequence and genomic islands. A phylogenetic intermediate O3:K6 clade (trh-, tdh- and GS-PCR+) was identified between the pandemic and old-O3:K6 clones. A comprehensive overview of genomic contents in a large collection of global isolates from the microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization data enabled us to construct a phylogenetic structure of V. parahaemolyticus and an evolutionary history of the pandemic group (clone) of this pathogen.
0 Solving the puzzle of chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation. Chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation is a prevalent problem among patients following a myocardial infarction. Until recently, the pathophysiology was poorly understood, resulting in surgical strategies with suboptimal results and limited durability. The surgical approach has evolved from revascularization alone to an additional mitral valve procedure, replacement, or repair. When the valve was repaired, isolated annuloplasty was performed. The dilemma that surgeons had when repairing a mitral valve was which type of ring to use and what size. In all series with annuloplasty alone, the results were poor with very high recurrence rates. The primary feature of ischemic mitral regurgitation is a prolapse of the anterior leaflet at A3 +/- A2. This prolapse can be caused by fibrotic elongation of the papillary muscle supporting A3 +/- A2 or tethering of P3 by a ballooning posterior left ventricular wall. Using a technique that corrects this prolapse with Gore-Tex neochords, we have achieved excellent results with effective and durable correction of the ischemic mitral regurgitation.
0 Common and distinct genetic properties of ESCRT-II components in Drosophila. Genetic studies in yeast have identified class E vps genes that form the ESCRT complexes required for protein sorting at the early endosome. In Drosophila, mutations of the ESCRT-II component vps25 cause endosomal defects leading to accumulation of Notch protein and increased Notch pathway activity. These endosomal and signaling defects are thought to account for several phenotypes. Depending on the developmental context, two different types of overgrowth can be detected. Tissue predominantly mutant for vps25 displays neoplastic tumor characteristics. In contrast, vps25 mutant clones in a wild-type background trigger hyperplastic overgrowth in a non-autonomous manner. In addition, vps25 mutant clones also promote apoptotic resistance in a non-autonomous manner. Here, we genetically characterize the remaining ESCRT-II components vps22 and vps36. Like vps25, mutants of vps22 and vps36 display endosomal defects, accumulate Notch protein and--when the tissue is predominantly mutant--show neoplastic tumor characteristics. However, despite these common phenotypes, they have distinct non-autonomous phenotypes. While vps22 mutations cause strong non-autonomous overgrowth, they do not affect apoptotic resistance. In contrast, vps36 mutations increase apoptotic resistance, but have little effect on non-autonomous proliferation. Further characterization reveals that although all ESCRT-II mutants accumulate Notch protein, only vps22 and vps25 mutations trigger Notch activity. The ESCRT-II components vps22, vps25 and vps36 display common and distinct genetic properties. Our data redefine the role of Notch for hyperplastic and neoplastic overgrowth in these mutants. While Notch is required for hyperplastic growth, it appears to be dispensable for neoplastic transformation.
3 Access to essential maternal health interventions and human rights violations among vulnerable communities in eastern Burma. Health indicators are poor and human rights violations are widespread in eastern Burma. Reproductive and maternal health indicators have not been measured in this setting but are necessary as part of an evaluation of a multi-ethnic pilot project exploring strategies to increase access to essential maternal health interventions. The goal of this study is to estimate coverage of maternal health services prior to this project and associations between exposure to human rights violations and access to such services. Selected communities in the Shan, Mon, Karen, and Karenni regions of eastern Burma that were accessible to community-based organizations operating from Thailand were surveyed to estimate coverage of reproductive, maternal, and family planning services, and to assess exposure to household-level human rights violations within the pilot-project target population. Two-stage cluster sampling surveys among ever-married women of reproductive age (15-45 y) documented access to essential antenatal care interventions, skilled attendance at birth, postnatal care, and family planning services. Mid-upper arm circumference, hemoglobin by color scale, and Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia by rapid diagnostic dipstick were measured. Exposure to human rights violations in the prior 12 mo was recorded. Between September 2006 and January 2007, 2,914 surveys were conducted. Eighty-eight percent of women reported a home delivery for their last pregnancy (within previous 5 y). Skilled attendance at birth (5.1%), any (39.3%) or > or = 4 (16.7%) antenatal visits, use of an insecticide-treated bed net (21.6%), and receipt of iron supplements (11.8%) were low. At the time of the survey, more than 60% of women had hemoglobin level estimates < or = 11.0 g/dl and 7.2% were Pf positive. Unmet need for contraceptives exceeded 60%. Violations of rights were widely reported: 32.1% of Karenni households reported forced labor and 10% of Karen households had been forced to move. Among Karen households, odds of anemia were 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-2.40) times higher among women reporting forced displacement, and 7.47 (95% CI 2.21-25.3) higher among those exposed to food security violations. The odds of receiving no antenatal care services were 5.94 (95% CI 2.23-15.8) times higher among those forcibly displaced. Coverage of basic maternal health interventions is woefully inadequate in these selected populations and substantially lower than even the national estimates for Burma, among the lowest in the region. Considerable political, financial, and human resources are necessary to improve access to maternal health care in these communities.
1 Ankle MRI for anterolateral soft tissue impingement: increased accuracy with the use of contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed 3D-FSPGR MRI. To validate the use of contrast-enhanced (CE) fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) fast gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state with radiofrequency spoiling (FSPGR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of anterolateral soft tissue impingement of the ankle, as compared to the use of routine ankle MRI. Contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed 3D-FSPGR MRI and routine MRI scans were retrospectively reviewed for 45 patients with arthroscopically proven anterolateral impingement. In addition, scans were reviewed in 45 control subjects with diagnoses other than impingement. Two radiologists independently reviewed the two sets of images in random order. Using areas (Az) under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), we compared the depiction of anterolateral soft tissue impingement in the two sets of images. The overall accuracy for lesion characterization was significantly higher (p < 0.05) using the CE fat-suppressed 3D-FSPGR MR images (Az = 0.892 and 0.881 for reader 1 and 2, respectively) than using the routine MR images (Az = 0.763 and 0.745). The use of CE fat-suppressed 3D-FSPGR MRI enhanced impingement depiction in most cases. However, in cases with a thickened non-enhancing scar or joint effusion, the routine images better depicted a soft tissue mass that intruded into anterolateral gutter than the CE images. The use of CE fat-suppressed 3D-FSPGR MRI of the ankle allows a more accurate assessment of anterolateral soft tissue impingement of the ankle, as compared to the use of routine MRI.
0 Origins of submovements in movements of elderly adults. Slowness is a well-recognized feature of movements in aging. One of the possible reasons for slowness suggested by previous research is production of corrective submovements that compensate for shortened primary submovement to the target. Here, we re-examine this traditional interpretation and argue that the majority of submovements in older adults may be a consequence rather than the cause of slowness. Pointing movements in young and older adults were recorded. Conditions for submovement emergence were manipulated by using small and large targets and three movement modes: discrete (required stopping on the target), reciprocal (required reversal on the target), and passing (required crossing the target and stopping after that). Movements were parsed into a primary and secondary submovement based on zero-crossings of velocity (type 1 submovements), acceleration (type 2 submovements), and jerk (type 3 submovements). In the passing mode, secondary submovements were analyzed only after crossing the target to exclude that they were accuracy adjustments. Consistent with previous research, the primary submovement was shortened and total secondary submovement incidence was increased in older adults. However, comparisons across conditions suggested that many submovements were non-corrective in both groups. Type 1 submovements were non-corrective because they were more frequent for large than small targets. They predominantly emerged due to arm stabilization and energy dissipation during motion termination in the discrete and passing mode. Although type 2 and 3 submovements were more frequent for small than large targets, this trend was also observed in the passing mode, suggesting that many of these submovements were non-corrective. Rather, they could have been velocity fluctuations associated predominantly with low speed of movements to small targets. The results question the traditional interpretation of frequent submovements in older adults as corrective adjustments. Rather, the increased incidence of submovements in older adults is directly related to low movement speed observed in aging, whereas the relationship between submovement incidence and target size is a result of speed-accuracy trade-off. Aging-related declines in muscular control that may contribute to the disproportional increases in submovement incidence during slow movements of older adults are discussed.
1 The prevalence of human papillomavirus infection in Korean non-small cell lung cancer patients. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a co-carcinogen of lung cancer and contributes to its pathogenesis. To evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect HPV 16, 18, and 33 DNA in tumor tissues of 112 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent curative surgery from Jan. 1995 to Dec. 1998 at Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea. The patients consisted of 90 men and 22 women. Nineteen patients were under 50 years old (17%), and 92 patients (82%) were smokers. Fifty-three patients had adenocarcinomas, while 59 patients had non-adenocarcinomas. Early stage (I and II) cancer was found in 64 patients (57.1%) and advanced stage (III and IV) found in 48 (42.9%). The prevalence of HPV 16, 18, and 33 were 12 (10.7%), 11 (9.8%), and 37 (33.0%), respectively. Smoking status, sex, and histologic type were not statistically different in the presence of HPV DNA. The presence of HPV 16 was more common in younger patients and HPV 18 was more common in advanced stage patients. This study showed that the prevalence rate of HPV 16 and 18 infections in NSCLC tissue was low, suggesting HPV 16 and 18 infections played a limited role in lung carcinogenesis of Koreans. However, the higher prevalence of HPV 33 infections in Korean lung cancer patients compared to other Asian and Western countries may be important and warrants further investigation.
1 Dissecting an alternative splicing analysis workflow for GeneChip Exon 1.0 ST Affymetrix arrays. A new microarray platform (GeneChip Exon 1.0 ST) has recently been developed by Affymetrix http://www.affymetrix.com. This microarray platform changes the conventional view of transcript analysis since it allows the evaluation of the expression level of a transcript by querying each exon component. The Exon 1.0 ST platform does however raise some issues regarding the approaches to be used in identifying genome-wide alternative splicing events (ASEs). In this study an exon-level data analysis workflow is dissected in order to detect limit and strength of each step, thus modifying the overall workflow and thereby optimizing the detection of ASEs. This study was carried out using a semi-synthetic exon-skipping benchmark experiment embedding a total of 268 exon skipping events. Our results point out that summarization methods (RMA, PLIER) do not affect the efficacy of statistical tools in detecting ASEs. However, data pre-filtering is mandatory if the detected number of false ASEs are to be reduced. MiDAS and Rank Product methods efficiently detect true ASEs but they suffer from the lack of multiple test error correction. The intersection of MiDAS and Rank Product results efficiently moderates the detection of false ASEs. To optimize the detection of ASEs we propose the following workflow: i) data pre-filtering, ii) statistical selection of ASEs using both MiDAS and Rank Product, iii) intersection of results derived from the two statistical analyses in order to moderate family-wise errors (FWER).
1 SuperSAGE: the drought stress-responsive transcriptome of chickpea roots. Drought is the major constraint to increase yield in chickpea (Cicer arietinum). Improving drought tolerance is therefore of outmost importance for breeding. However, the complexity of the trait allowed only marginal progress. A solution to the current stagnation is expected from innovative molecular tools such as transcriptome analyses providing insight into stress-related gene activity, which combined with molecular markers and expression (e)QTL mapping, may accelerate knowledge-based breeding. SuperSAGE, an improved version of the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) technique, generating genome-wide, high-quality transcription profiles from any eukaryote, has been employed in the present study. The method produces 26 bp long fragments (26 bp tags) from defined positions in cDNAs, providing sufficient sequence information to unambiguously characterize the mRNAs. Further, SuperSAGE tags may be immediately used to produce microarrays and probes for real-time-PCR, thereby overcoming the lack of genomic tools in non-model organisms. We applied SuperSAGE to the analysis of gene expression in chickpea roots in response to drought. To this end, we sequenced 80,238 26 bp tags representing 17,493 unique transcripts (UniTags) from drought-stressed and non-stressed control roots. A total of 7,532 (43%) UniTags were more than 2.7-fold differentially expressed, and 880 (5.0%) were regulated more than 8-fold upon stress. Their large size enabled the unambiguous annotation of 3,858 (22%) UniTags to genes or proteins in public data bases and thus to stress-response processes. We designed a microarray carrying 3,000 of these 26 bp tags. The chip data confirmed 79% of the tag-based results, whereas RT-PCR confirmed the SuperSAGE data in all cases. This study represents the most comprehensive analysis of the drought-response transcriptome of chickpea available to date. It demonstrates that--inter alias--signal transduction, transcription regulation, osmolyte accumulation, and ROS scavenging undergo strong transcriptional remodelling in chickpea roots already 6 h after drought stress. Certain transcript isoforms characterizing these processes are potential targets for breeding for drought tolerance. We demonstrate that these can be easily accessed by micro-arrays and RT-PCR assays readily produced downstream of SuperSAGE. Our study proves that SuperSAGE owns potential for molecular breeding also in non-model crops.
2 The effect of unilateral medial rectus muscle resection in patients with recurrent exotropia. To investigate the effect of unilateral medial rectus muscle resection for recurrent exotropia after bilateral lateral rectus muscle recession for intermittent exotropia A retrospective analysis was made of thirtypatients who underwent unilateral medial rectus resection for recurrent exotropia. All had prior bilateral lateral rectus recession for intermittent exotropia. Data were collected for age, the preoperative deviation, the postoperative deviation at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and the last visit, and the amount of medial rectus resection performed. The average preoperative deviation was 27.0+/-3.6 PD. After unilateral medial rectus resection, average deviation at distance was 2.8 PD at postoperative 2 weeks, 4.5 PD at 3 months, 5.1 PD at 6 months and 5.8 PD at last visit. The average deviation corrected per millimeter of medial rectus resection was 3.53+/-0.17 PD/mm. Considering that deviation angles of recurrent exotropia is smaller than those of primary surgery and the possibility of saving the other medial rectus muscle, unilateral rectus muscle resection could be effective surgical method for recurrent exotropia.
2 Pericardium plug in the repair of the corneoscleral fistula after Ahmed Glaucoma Valve explantation. We report four cases in which a pericardium (Tutoplast) plug was used to repair a corneoscleral fistula after Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) explantation. In four cases in which the AGV tube had been exposed, AGV explantation was performed using a pericardium (Tutoplast) plug to seal the defect previously occupied by the tube. After debridement of the fistula, a piece of processed pericardium (Tutoplast), measured 1 mm in width, was plugged into the fistula and secured with two interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures. To control intraocular pressure, a new AGV was implanted elsewhere in case 1, phaco-trabeculectomy was performed concurrently in case 2, cyclophotocoagulation was performed postoperatively in case 3 and anti-glaucomatous medication was added in case 4. No complication related to the fistula developed at the latest follow-up (range: 12-26 months). The pericardium (Tutoplast) plug seems to be an effective method in the repair of corneoscleral fistulas resulting from explantation of glaucoma drainage implants.
1 Three years follow-up of screen-detected diabetic and non-diabetic subjects: who is better off? The ADDITION Netherlands study. People with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia might be at risk of lacking adequate control for cardiovascular risk factors. Our aim was to determine the extent of health care utilization and provision in primary care and to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular disease in persons with an elevated risk score in a stepwise diabetes screening programme. A total of 56,978 non-diabetic patients, aged 50-70 years, from 79 practices in the Netherlands were invited to participate in a screening programme starting with a questionnaire. Those with an elevated score, underwent further glucose testing. Screened participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 64), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (n = 62), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (n = 86), and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (n = 142) were compared after three years regarding use of medication, care provider encounters and occurrence of CVD. In all glucose regulation categories cardiovascular medication was prescribed more frequently during follow-up with the strongest increase in diabetic patients. Number of practice visits was higher in diabetic patients compared to those in the other categories. Glucose, lipids, and blood pressure were measured most frequently in diabetic patients. Numbers of cardiovascular events in participants with NGT, IFG, IGT and diabetes were 16.7, 32.6, 17.3 and 15.7 per 1,000 person-years (non significant), respectively. After three years of follow-up, screened non-diabetic participants with an elevated risk score had cardiovascular event rates comparable with diabetic patients. Screened non-diabetic persons are at risk of lacking optimal control for cardiovascular risk factors while screen-detected diabetic patients were controlled adequately.
2 Dexamethasone potentiates the antiangiogenic activity of docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer. We sought to characterise whether dexamethasone (DEX) may enhance tumour response to docetaxel in in vitro and in vivo models of metastatic prostate cancer (CaP). In vitro experiments conducted on PC3 and human bone marrow endothelial cells (hBMECs) determined that administration of DEX (10 nM) reduced constitutive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity, decreasing interleukin (IL)-8, CXCL1 and VEGF gene expression in PC3 cells. Dexamethasone also attenuated docetaxel-induced NF-kappaB and activator protein-1 transcription and reduced docetaxel-promoted expression/secretion of IL-8 and CXCL1 in PC3 and hBMECs. Although DEX failed to enhance docetaxel cytotoxicity on PC3 cells, DEX potentiated the antiangiogenic activity of docetaxel in vitro, further reducing vessel area and vessel length in developing endothelial tubes (P<0.05). Docetaxel had a potent antiangiogenic activity in the dorsal skin flap-implanted PC3 tumours in vivo. Small blood vessel formation was further suppressed in tumours co-treated with docetaxel and DEX, substantiated by an increased average vessel diameter and segment length and a decreased number of branch points in the residual tumour vasculature (P<0.001). Our data show that DEX potentiates the antiangiogenic activity of docetaxel, suggesting a putative mechanism for the palliative and survival benefits of these agents in metastatic CaP.
2 Therapeutic comparison of chemotherapy and surgery for early stage diffuse large B-cell gastric lymphoma. The use of surgery versus stomach-preserving treatment for primary gastric lymphoma has caused controversy among doctors. This retrospective, single center study aims to evaluate the efficacy and benefit of stomach-preserving treatment against surgery for early stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of stomach. From August 1991 to January 2006, 43 cases of early-stage diffuse large B-cell gastric lymphoma were reviewed. Eleven cases were treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiation (CT +/- RT), 17 were treated with surgery alone (OP), and 15 were treated with surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy (OP + CT). The complete remission and response rates were 63.6% and 90.9% in those treated with CT +/- RT (7 complete responders, 3 partial responders, 1 non-responder), 100% and 100% in those treated with OP, and 100% and 100% in those treated with OP + CT, respectively. Five-year overall survival rates were 85.7%, 87.5%, and 100% in those treated by CT +/- RT, OP, and OP + CT, respectively (p=0.76). The five-year disease free survival rates were 100%, 87.5% and 100% in those treated by CT +/- RT, OP, and OP + CT, respectively (p=0.99). There was no significant difference in overall survival and disease free survival between modalities. Even though there are no definite differences in the number of complications between those treated by CT +/- RT or OP, these facts reflect little concern on complications after surgery. In preventing morbidity arising from early or late complications from surgery and promoting quality of life, chemotherapy should be a primary consideration for early stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the stomach.
3 Developmental and lactational exposure to dieldrin alters mammary tumorigenesis in Her2/neu transgenic mice. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Western women and while its precise etiology is unknown, environmental factors are thought to play a role. The organochlorine pesticide dieldrin is a persistent environmental toxicant thought to increase the risk of breast cancer and reduce survival in the human population. The objective of this study was to define the effect of developmental exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of dieldrin, on mammary tumor development in the offspring. Sexually mature FVB-MMTV/neu female mice were treated with vehicle (corn oil), or dieldrin (0.45, 2.25, and 4.5 microg/g body weight) daily by gavage for 5 days prior to mating and then once weekly throughout gestation and lactation until weaning. Dieldrin concentrations were selected to produce serum levels representative of human background body burdens, occupational exposure, and overt toxicity. Treatment had no effect on litter size, birth weight or the number of pups surviving to weaning. The highest dose of dieldrin significantly increased the total tumor burden and the volume and number of tumors found in the thoracic mammary glands. Increased mRNA and protein expression of the neurotrophin BDNF and its receptor TrkB was increased in tumors from the offspring of dieldrin treated dams. This study indicates that developmental exposure to the environmental contaminant dieldrin causes increased tumor burden in genetically predisposed mice. Dieldrin exposure also altered the expression of BNDF and TrkB, novel modulators of cancer pathogenesis.
0 Sulindac prevents esophageal adenocarcinomas induced by gastroduodenal reflux in rats. It is known that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression is increased in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinomas. We studied COX-2 expression and the effect sulindac has on the genesis of Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma in rats undergoing esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis (EGDA). Fifty-one rats were divided into a control group (n=27), a 500 ppm sulindac-treated group (n=15) and 1000 ppm sulindac-treated group (n=9). Randomly selected rats were killed by diethyl ether inhalation at 20 and 40 weeks after surgery. At 40 weeks, rats treated with 1000 ppm sulindac showed narrower esophageal diameter and milder inflammation than the control rats. At 40 weeks, the incidence of Barrett's esophagus was similar between control and sulindac-treated groups, but the incidence of adenocarcinoma was significantly lower in the 1000 ppm sulindac-treated group than either the control or 500 ppm sulindac-treated groups. COX-2 was significantly increased in the lower esophagus of control rats killed at 40 weeks. Cyclin D1 expression was negligible in the sulindac- treated group compared with the control group. We suggest that the chemopreventive effect of sulindac is related to decreased COX-2 and cyclin D1 expression, which may be influenced by reduced inflammation.
3 Large-scale preparation of active caspase-3 in E. coli by designing its thrombin-activatable precursors. Caspase-3, a principal apoptotic effector that cleaves the majority of cellular substrates, is an important medicinal target for the treatment of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Large amounts of the protein are required for drug discovery research. However, previous efforts to express the full-length caspase-3 gene in E. coli have been unsuccessful. Overproducers of thrombin-activatable full-length caspase-3 precursors were prepared by engineering the auto-activation sites of caspase-3 precursor into a sequence susceptible to thrombin hydrolysis. The engineered precursors were highly expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli and easily purified by affinity chromatography, to levels of 10-15 mg from 1 L of E. coli culture, and readily activated by thrombin digestion. Kinetic evaluation disclosed that thrombin digestion enhanced catalytic activity (kcat/KM) of the precursor proteins by two orders of magnitude. A novel method for a large-scale preparation of active caspase-3 was developed by a strategic engineering to lack auto-activation during expression with amino acid sequences susceptible to thrombin, facilitating high-level expression in E. coli. The precursor protein was easily purified and activated through specific cleavage at the engineered sites by thrombin, generating active caspase-3 in high yields.
1 Aortic stenosis: evaluation with multidetector CT angiography and MR imaging. Aortic valvular stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease which results in the need for a valve replacement. Although a Doppler echocardiography is the current reference imaging method, the multidetector computerized tomograpghy (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have recently emerged as a promising method for noninvasive valve imaging. In this study, we briefly describe the usefulness and comparative merits of the MDCT and MRI for the evaluation of AS in terms of valvular morphology (as the causes of AS), quantification of aortic valve area, pressure gradient of flow (for assessment severity of AS), and the evaluation of the ascending aorta and cardiac function (as the secondary effects of AS). The familiarity with the MDCT and MRI features of AS is considered to be helpful for the accurate diagnosis and proper management of patients with a poor acoustic window.
1 Two cases of acute leukopenia induced by colchicine with concurrent immunosuppressants use in Behçet's disease. Colchicine-induced leukopenia usually occurrs in intentional or accidental overdoses or inappropriate use in combination with intravenous and oral colchine; however, there have been several reports of hematologic toxicity in short-term and small-dose colchicine medication courses. We present two cases of leukopenia induced by colchicine use concurrent with immunosuppressants in Behçet's disease. We postulate that the mechanism of colchicine-induced leukopenia might be the destruction of circulating leukocytes and an inhibition of leukocyte production by the immediate and direct toxic effect of colchicine on idiosyncrasies unique to each patient. The concurrently administered immunosuppressant might decrease the threshold for hematologic toxicity of colchicine in the leukocytes and their precursor cells.
1 Early outcome of TKA with a medial pivot fixed-bearing prosthesis is worse than with a PFC mobile-bearing prosthesis. Although the design features of the Medial Pivot fixed-bearing prosthesis reportedly improve kinematics compared with TKAs using fixed-bearings, clinical improvements have not been reported. We asked whether the clinical and radiographic outcomes, ranges of motion of the knee, patient satisfaction, and complication rates would be better in knees with a Medial Pivot fixed-bearing prosthesis than in those with a PFC Sigma mobile-bearing prosthesis. We compared the results of 92 patients who had a Medial Pivot fixed-bearing prosthesis implanted in one knee and a PFC Sigma mobile-bearing prosthesis implanted in the other. There were 85 women and seven men with a mean age of 69.5 years (range, 55-81 years). The minimum followup was 2 years (mean, 2.6 years; range, 2-3 years). The patients were assessed clinically and radiographically using the rating systems of the Hospital for Special Surgery and the Knee Society at 3 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. Contrary to expectations, we found worse early clinical outcomes, smaller ranges of knee motion, less patient satisfaction, and a higher complication rate for the Medial Pivot fixed-bearing prosthesis than for the PFC Sigma mobile-bearing prosthesis. Level I, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
0 Molecular epidemiologic investigations of Mycoplasma gallisepticum conjunctivitis in songbirds by random amplified polymorphic DNA analyses. An ongoing outbreak of conjunctivitis in free-ranging house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) began in 1994 in the eastern United States. Bacterial organisms identified as Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) were isolated from lesions of infected birds. MG was also isolated from a blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) that contracted conjunctivitis after being housed in a cage previously occupied by house finches with conjunctivitis, and from free-ranging American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis) in North Carolina in 1996. To investigate the molecular epidemiology of this outbreak, we produced DNA fingerprints of MG isolates by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). We compared MG isolates from songbirds examined from 1994 through 1996 in 11 states, representing three host species, with vaccine and reference strains and with contemporary MG isolates from commercial poultry. All MG isolates from songbirds had RAPD banding patterns identical to each other but different from other strains and isolates tested. These results indicate that the outbreak of MG in songbirds is caused by the same strain, which suggests a single source; the outbreak is not caused by the vaccine or reference strains analyzed; and MG infection has not been shared between songbirds and commercial poultry.
0 Lacunar infarction in type 2 diabetes is associated with an elevated intracranial arterial pulsatility index. The arterial pulsatility index (PI) is measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) and is postulated to reflect the vascular resistance distal to the artery being examined. An increased PI of the intracranial artery is often reported with diabetes mellitus (DM), old age, hypertension, intracranial hypertension, vascular dementia, and small artery disease. Microvascular complication of DM, which may contribute to cerebral infarction, involves the small perforating artery and may influence the PI of the proximal artery. We performed a TCD examination in patients with type 2 DM with acute lacunar infarction (DML, n=35), type 2 DM without cerebral infarction (DMO, n=69), and in control cases with no DM or cerebral infarction (control group, n=41). We then compared the TCD findings among these groups. The PI was significantly higher in the DML and DMO groups than in the control group (1.05, 0.93, 0.73. respectively, for the right middle cerebral artery; 1.04, 0.90, 0.73, respectively, for the left middle cerebral artery; 0.97, 0.89, 0.70, respectively, for the basilar artery). The PI was also significantly higher in the DML group than in the DMO group for both middle cerebral arteries. The flow velocity was comparable among the three groups. The elevated PI of the intracranial arteries may reflect diabetic cerebral microvascular complications. The PI measurement using TCD may be a useful predictor of lacunar infarction in type 2 DM patients.
1 Physical activity and dietary behaviour in a population-based sample of British 10-year old children: the SPEEDY study (Sport, Physical activity and Eating behaviour: environmental Determinants in Young people). The SPEEDY study was set up to quantify levels of physical activity (PA) and dietary habits and the association with potential correlates in 9-10 year old British school children. We present here the analyses of the PA, dietary and anthropometry data. In a cross-sectional study of 2064 children (926 boys, 1138 girls) in Norfolk, England, we collected anthropometry data at school using standardised procedures. Body mass index (BMI) was used to define obesity status. PA was assessed with the Actigraph accelerometer over 7 days. A cut-off of > or = 2000 activity counts was used to define minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Dietary habits were assessed using the Health Behaviour in School Children food questionnaire. Weight status was defined using published international cut-offs (Cole, 2000). Differences between groups were assessed using independent t-tests for continuous data and chi-squared tests for categorical data. Valid PA data (>500 minutes per day on > or = 3 days) was available for 1888 children. Mean (+/- SD) activity counts per minute among boys and girls were 716.5 +/- 220.2 and 635.6 +/- 210.6, respectively (p < 0.001). Boys spent an average of 84.1 +/- 25.9 minutes in MVPA per day compared to 66.1 +/- 20.8 among girls (p < 0.001), with an average of 69.1% of children accumulating 60 minutes each day. The proportion of children classified as overweight and obese was 15.0% and 4.1% for boys and 19.3% and 6.6% for girls, respectively (p = 0.001). Daily consumption of at least one portion of fruit and of vegetables was 56.8% and 49.9% respectively, with higher daily consumption in girls than boys and in children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. Results indicate that almost 70% of children meet national PA guidelines, indicating that a prevention of decline, rather than increasing physical activity levels, might be an appropriate intervention target. Promotion of daily fruit and vegetable intake in this age group is also warranted, possibly focussing on children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
1 Immunohistochemical profiling of benign, low malignant potential and low grade serous epithelial ovarian tumors. Serous epithelial ovarian tumors can be subdivided into benign (BOV), low malignant potential (LMP) or borderline and invasive (TOV) tumors. Although the molecular characteristics of serous BOV, LMP and low grade (LG) TOV tumors has been initiated, definitive immunohistochemical markers to distinguish between these tumor types have not been defined. In the present study, we used a tissue array composed of 27 BOVs, 78 LMPs and 23 LG TOVs to evaluate the protein expression of a subset of selected candidates identified in our previous studies (Ape1, Set, Ran, Ccne1 and Trail) or known to be implicated in epithelial ovarian cancer disease (p21, Ccnb1, Ckd1). Statistically significant difference in protein expression was observed for Ccnb1 when BOV tumors were compared to LMP tumors (p = 0.003). When BOV were compared to LG TOV tumors, Trail was significantly expressed at a higher level in malignant tumors (p = 0.01). Expression of p21 was significantly lower in LG tumors when compared with either BOVs (p = 0.03) or LMPs (p = 0.001). We also observed that expression of p21 was higher in LMP tumors with no (p = 0.02) or non-invasive (p = 0.01) implants compared to the LMP associated with invasive implants. This study represents an extensive analyse of the benign and highly differentiated ovarian disease from an immunohistochemical perspective.
3 Symptomatic acute hepatitis C in Egypt: diagnosis, spontaneous viral clearance, and delayed treatment with 12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2a. The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of spontaneous viral clearance (SVC) after symptomatic acute hepatitis C and to evaluate the efficacy of 12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2a in patients who did not clear the virus spontaneously. Patients with symptomatic acute hepatitis C were recruited from two "fever hospitals" in Cairo, Egypt. Patients still viremic three months after the onset of symptoms were considered for treatment with 12 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 microg/week). Between May 2002 and February 2006, 2243 adult patients with acute hepatitis were enrolled in the study. The SVC rate among 117 patients with acute hepatitis C was 33.8% (95%CI [25.9%-43.2%]) at three months and 41.5% (95%CI [33.0%-51.2%]) at six months. The sustained virological response (SVR) rate among the 17 patients who started treatment 4-6 months after onset of symptoms was 15/17 = 88.2% (95%CI [63.6%-98.5%]). Spontaneous viral clearance was high (41.5% six months after the onset of symptoms) in this population with symptomatic acute hepatitis C. Allowing time for spontaneous clearance should be considered before treatment is initiated for symptomatic acute hepatitis C.
1 Frequency and predictors of miliary tuberculosis in patients with miliary pulmonary nodules in South Korea: a retrospective cohort study. Miliary pulmonary nodules are commonly caused by various infections and cancers. We sought to identify the relative frequencies of various aetiologies and the clinical and radiographic predictors of miliary tuberculosis (TB) in patients with miliary pulmonary nodules. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who presented with micronodules occupying more than two-thirds of the lung volume, based on computed tomography (CT) of the chest, between November 2001 and April 2007, in a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea. We analyzed 76 patients with miliary pulmonary nodules. Their median age was 52 years and 38 (50%) were males; 18 patients (24%) had a previous or current malignancy and five (7%) had a history of TB. The most common diagnoses of miliary nodules were miliary TB (41 patients, 54%) and miliary metastasis of malignancies (20 patients, 26%). Multivariate analysis revealed that age <or=30 years, HIV infection, corticosteroid use, bronchogenic spread of lesions, and ground-glass opacities occupying >25% of total lung volume increased the probability of miliary TB. However, a history of malignancy decreased the probability of miliary TB. Miliary TB accounted for approximately half of all causes of miliary pulmonary nodules. Young age, an immune-compromised state, and several clinical and radiographic characteristics increased the probability of miliary TB.
3 Accelerated tumor growth in mice deficient in DNAM-1 receptor. Since the identification of ligands for human and mouse DNAM-1, emerging evidence has suggested that DNAM-1 plays an important role in the T cell- and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated recognition and lysis of tumor cells. However, it remains undetermined whether DNAM-1 is involved in tumor immune surveillance in vivo. We addressed this question by using DNAM-1-deficient mice. DNAM-1-deficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and NK cells showed significantly less cytotoxic activity against DNAM-1 ligand-expressing tumors in vitro than wild-type (WT) cells. The methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced fibrosarcoma cell line Meth A expressed the DNAM-1 ligand CD155, and DNAM-1-deficient mice showed increased tumor development and mortality after transplantation of Meth A cells. Moreover, the DNAM-1-deficient mice developed significantly more DNAM-1 ligand-expressing fibrosarcoma and papilloma cells in response to the chemical carcinogens MCA and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), respectively, than did WT mice. These results indicate that DNAM-1 plays an important role in immune surveillance of tumor development.
3 The prevalence and demographic characteristics of anterior polar cataract in a hospital-based study in Korea. Anterior Polar Cataract (APC) develops by a mechanism different from that of other age-related cataracts, and outside of Korea, it is an extremely rare condition. We investigated the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of APC in Koreans. The evaluation on the prevalence of APC in comparison to the other age-related cataracts was performed on the 2,108 cataract patients who were treated at 5 different areas in Korea from August 2003 to December 2003. The demographic characteristics of APC were studied on the, 656 cataract patients who were treated from January 2004 to January 2005 at one hospital. These patients were classified according to the type of lens opacity (nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular, mixed and APC). The prevalence of patients with APC among all the cataract patients was 6.02% during the 5 months in this hospital-based study. Eighty-seven per cent of patients with APC were male. In contrast, the proportion of female was greater than 50% in the other cataracts. The mean age of APC patients was 52.7 years. Among the APC patients, 38.9% were under 50 years of age, 42.6% in their 50s, 14.8% in their 60s, and 3.7% were in their 70s. However, 80% of patients were over the age of 60 years in nuclear, cortical, and mixed-type cataracts. The prevalence of APC among all cataracts was high in comparison with another country. The proportion of APC was high in individuals younger than 60 years of age, and in males.
3 Induction of galectin-1 expression by HTLV-I Tax and its impact on HTLV-I infectivity. Cell-free Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type I (HTLV-I) virions are poorly infectious and cell-to-cell contact is often required to achieve infection. Other factors might thus importantly contribute in increasing infection by HTLV-I. Galectin-1 is a galactoside-binding lectin which is secreted by activated T lymphocytes. Several functions have been attributed to this protein including its capacity to increase cell-to-cell adhesion. Based on previous studies, we postulated that this protein could also accentuate HTLV-I infection. Herein, we demonstrate that galectin-1 expression and release are higher in HTLV-I-infected T cells in comparison to uninfected T cells. Furthermore, galectin-1 expression was activated in various cell lines expressing the wild type viral Tax protein while this induction was minimal upon expression of NF-kappaB activation-defective TaxM22. Cotransfection of these Tax expression vectors with galectin-1 promoter-driven luciferase constructs confirmed that Tax upregulated galectin-1 promoter activity. However, a NF-kappaB-independent mechanism was strongly favoured in this induction of galectin-1 expression as no activation of the promoter was apparent in Jurkat cells treated with known NF-kappaB activators. Using HTLV-I envelope pseudotyped HIV-1 virions, galectin-1 was shown to increase infectivity. In addition, a co-culture assay with HTLV-I-infected cells also indicated an increase in cell fusion upon addition of galectin-1. This effect was not mediated by factors present in the supernatant of the HTLV-I-infected cells. These data suggest that HTLV-I Tax increases galectin-1 expression and that this modulation could play an important role in HTLV-I infection by stabilizing both cell-to-cell and virus-cell interactions.
0 Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in a tropical setting: patient outcome and impact of antibiotic resistance. Most information on invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections comes from temperate countries. There are considerable knowledge gaps in epidemiology, treatment, drug resistance and outcome of invasive S. aureus infection in the tropics. A prospective, observational study of S. aureus bacteraemia was conducted in a 1000-bed regional hospital in northeast Thailand over 1 year. Detailed clinical data were collected and final outcomes determined at 12 weeks, and correlated with antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of infecting isolates. Ninety-eight patients with S. aureus bacteraemia were recruited. The range of clinical manifestations was similar to that reported from temperate countries. The prevalence of endocarditis was 14%. The disease burden was highest at both extremes of age, whilst mortality increased with age. The all-cause mortality rate was 52%, with a mortality attributable to S. aureus of 44%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was responsible for 28% of infections, all of which were healthcare-associated. Mortality rates for MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) were 67% (18/27) and 46% (33/71), respectively (p = 0.11). MRSA isolates were multidrug resistant. Only vancomycin or fusidic acid would be suitable as empirical treatment options for suspected MRSA infection. S. aureus is a significant pathogen in northeast Thailand, with comparable clinical manifestations and a similar endocarditis prevalence but higher mortality than industrialised countries. S. aureus bacteraemia is frequently associated with exposure to healthcare settings with MRSA causing a considerable burden of disease. Further studies are required to define setting-specific strategies to reduce mortality from S. aureus bacteraemia, prevent MRSA transmission, and to define the burden of S. aureus disease and emergence of drug resistance throughout the developing world.
2 Effect of adding a virtual community (bulletin board) to smokefree.gov: randomized controlled trial. Demand for online information and help exceeds most other forms of self-help. Web-assisted tobacco interventions (WATIs) offer a potentially low-cost way to reach millions of smokers who wish to quit smoking and to test various forms of online assistance for use/utilization and user satisfaction. Our primary aim was to determine the utilization of and satisfaction with 2 versions of a smoking cessation website (smokefree.gov), one of which included an asynchronous bulletin board (BB condition). A secondary goal was to measure changes in smoking behavior 3 months after enrollment in the study. All participants were adult federal employees or contractors to the federal government who responded to an email and indicated a willingness to quit smoking in 30 days. We randomly assigned participants to either the BB condition or the publicly available version--usual care (UC)--and then assessed the number of minutes of website use and satisfaction with each condition as well as changes in smoking behavior. Among the 1375 participants, 684 were randomized to the BB intervention, and 691 to the control UC condition. A total of 39.7% returned a follow-up questionnaire after 3 months, with similar rates across the two groups (UC: n=279, 40.3%; BB: n=267, 39.0%). Among those respondents assigned to the BB condition, only 81 participants (11.8%) elected to view the bulletin board or post a message, limiting our ability to analyze the impact of bulletin board use on cessation. Satisfaction with the website was high and did not differ significantly between conditions (UC: 90.2%, BB: 84.9%, P= .08). Utilization, or minutes spent on the website, was significantly longer for the BB than the UC condition (18.0 vs 11.1, P = .01) and was nearly double for those who remained in the study (21.2) than for those lost to follow-up (9.6, P< .001). Similar differences were observed between those who made a serious quit attempt versus those who did not (22.4 vs 10.4, P= .02) and between those with a quit date on or a few days prior to the enrollment date versus those with a later quit date (29.4 vs 12.5, P = .001). There were no statistically significant differences in quit rates between the BB and UC group, both in intent-to-treat analysis (ITT) and in analyzing the adherence subgroup (respondents) only. Combined across the UC and BB groups, 7-day abstinence was 6.8% with ITT and 17.6% using only participants in the follow-up (adherence). For participants who attempted to quit within a few days of study entry (vs 30 days), quit rates were 29.6% (ITT) and 44.4% (adherence). Quit rates for participants were similar to other WATIs, with the most favorable outcomes demonstrated by smokers ready to quit at the time of enrolling in the trial and smokers using pharmacotherapy. Utilization of the asynchronous bulletin board was lower than expected, and did not have an impact on outcomes (quit rates). Given the demand for credible online resources for smoking cessation, future studies should continue to evaluate use of and satisfaction with Web features and to clarify results in terms of time since last cigarette as well as use of pharmacotherapy.
1 Enhanced Bayesian modelling in BAPS software for learning genetic structures of populations. During the most recent decade many Bayesian statistical models and software for answering questions related to the genetic structure underlying population samples have appeared in the scientific literature. Most of these methods utilize molecular markers for the inferences, while some are also capable of handling DNA sequence data. In a number of earlier works, we have introduced an array of statistical methods for population genetic inference that are implemented in the software BAPS. However, the complexity of biological problems related to genetic structure analysis keeps increasing such that in many cases the current methods may provide either inappropriate or insufficient solutions. We discuss the necessity of enhancing the statistical approaches to face the challenges posed by the ever-increasing amounts of molecular data generated by scientists over a wide range of research areas and introduce an array of new statistical tools implemented in the most recent version of BAPS. With these methods it is possible, e.g., to fit genetic mixture models using user-specified numbers of clusters and to estimate levels of admixture under a genetic linkage model. Also, alleles representing a different ancestry compared to the average observed genomic positions can be tracked for the sampled individuals, and a priori specified hypotheses about genetic population structure can be directly compared using Bayes' theorem. In general, we have improved further the computational characteristics of the algorithms behind the methods implemented in BAPS facilitating the analyses of large and complex datasets. In particular, analysis of a single dataset can now be spread over multiple computers using a script interface to the software. The Bayesian modelling methods introduced in this article represent an array of enhanced tools for learning the genetic structure of populations. Their implementations in the BAPS software are designed to meet the increasing need for analyzing large-scale population genetics data. The software is freely downloadable for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X systems at http://web.abo.fi/fak/mnf//mate/jc/software/baps.html.
0 The use of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents as an outcome criterion to evaluate family oriented support for young carers in Germany: an integrative review of the literature. Young people below the age of 18, whose lives are affected by looking after a relative with a disability or long-term illness, are called young carers. Evidence based family oriented support for young carers and their families in Germany is currently being developed. To allow for scientific evaluation, an outcome criterion needs to be chosen. Until today, there are no assessment instruments available, which focus on young carer's specific demands and needs. As HRQOL seems to be an adequate alternative outcome criterion, an integrative review of the literature was carried out to verify this assumption. The aim of the integrative review was to get information about a) the concept and the common definition of HRQOL in children, b) preferable HRQOL assessment techniques in children, and c) the relevance of HRQOL measures for the population of young carers. An additional aim of the review was to give advice on which instrument fits best to assess young carer's HRQOL in Germany. Searches were conducted in PubMed in order to obtain papers reporting about a) the development or psychometric assessment of instruments measuring HRQOL in children and adolescents up to the age of 18, and b) on the conceptual framework of HRQOL in children. HRQOL is a multidimensional construct covering physical, emotional, mental, social, and behavioural components of well-being and functioning as subjective perceived by a person depending on the cultural context and value system one is living in. Young carer's problems and needs are well covered by these common domains of HRQOL. Since no specific HRQOL-measures are available to address young carers, a generic one has to be chosen which a) has been created for use in children, b) allows self- and proxy-report, and c) has good psychometric testing results. Comparing four generic measures with currently best published psychometric testing results, items of the KIDSCREEN cover young carer's specific problems most accurate. The KIDSCREEN questionnaires seems adequate to evaluate the intervention as their items cover young carer's needs and problems most accurate.
3 The skeletal L-type Ca(2+) current is a major contributor to excitation-coupled Ca(2+) entry. The term excitation-coupled Ca(2+) entry (ECCE) designates the entry of extracellular Ca(2+) into skeletal muscle cells, which occurs in response to prolonged depolarization or pulse trains and depends on the presence of both the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) in the plasma membrane and the type 1 ryanodine receptor in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane. The ECCE pathway is blocked by pharmacological agents that also block store-operated Ca(2+) entry, is inhibited by dantrolene, is relatively insensitive to the DHP antagonist nifedipine (1 microM), and is permeable to Mn(2+). Here, we have examined the effects of these agents on the L-type Ca(2+) current conducted via the DHPR. We found that the nonspecific cation channel antagonists (2-APB, SKF 96356, La(3+), and Gd(3+)) and dantrolene all inhibited the L-type Ca(2+) current. In addition, complete (>97%) block of the L-type current required concentrations of nifedipine >10 microM. Like ECCE, the L-type Ca(2+) channel displays permeability to Mn(2+) in the absence of external Ca(2+) and produces a Ca(2+) current that persists during prolonged ( approximately 10-second) depolarization. This current appears to contribute to the Ca(2+) transient observed during prolonged KCl depolarization of intact myotubes because (1) the transients in normal myotubes decayed more rapidly in the absence of external Ca(2+); (2) the transients in dysgenic myotubes expressing SkEIIIK (a DHPR alpha(1S) pore mutant thought to conduct only monovalent cations) had a time course like that of normal myotubes in Ca(2+)-free solution and were unaffected by Ca(2+) removal; and (3) after block of SR Ca(2+) release by 200 microM ryanodine, normal myotubes still displayed a large Ca(2+) transient, whereas no transient was detectable in SkEIIIK-expressing dysgenic myotubes. Collectively, these results indicate that the skeletal muscle L-type channel is a major contributor to the Ca(2+) entry attributed to ECCE.
1 Early experiences of robotic-assisted laparoscopic liver resection. The surgical robotic system is superior to traditional laparoscopy in regards to 3-dimensional images and better instrumentations. Robotic surgery for hepatic resection has not yet been extensively reported. Between March and May 2007, we performed 3 robot-assisted left lateral sectionectomies of the liver. Case 1 had a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), case 2 had colon cancer with liver metastasis, and case 3 had intrahepatic duct stones. All patients had successful operation and recovered without complications. Shorter length of hospital stays, earlier start of oral feeding and less amount of ascites were found. However, case 1 had recurrent HCC at 3 months after operation. Robotic-assisted liver surgery is still a new field in its developing stage. In patients with small malignant tumors and benign liver diseases, robotic-assisted laparoscopic resection is feasible and safe. Through experience, the use of robotics is expected to increase in the treatment of benign diseases and malignant neoplasms. However, careful patient selection is important and long-term outcomes need to be evaluated.
0 Validating discovered Cis-acting regulatory genetic variants: application of an allele specific expression approach to HapMap populations. Localising regulatory variants that control gene expression is a challenge for genome research. Several studies have recently identified non-coding polymorphisms associated with inter-individual differences in gene expression. These approaches rely on the identification of signals of association against a background of variation due to other genetic and environmental factors. A complementary approach is to use an Allele-Specific Expression (ASE) assay, which is more robust to the effects of environmental variation and trans-acting genetic factors. Here we apply an ASE method which utilises heterozygosity within an individual to compare expression of the two alleles of a gene in a single cell. We used individuals from three HapMap population groups and analysed the allelic expression of genes with cis-regulatory regions previously identified using total gene expression studies. We were able to replicate the results in five of the six genes tested, and refined the cis- associated regions to a small number of variants. We also showed that by using multi-populations it is possible to refine the associated cis-effect DNA regions. We discuss the efficacy and drawbacks of both total gene expression and ASE approaches in the discovery of cis-acting variants. We show that the ASE approach has significant advantages as it is a cleaner representation of cis-acting effects. We also discuss the implication of using different populations to map cis-acting regions and the importance of finding regulatory variants which contribute to human phenotypic variation.
0 Integrase and integration: biochemical activities of HIV-1 integrase. Integration of retroviral DNA is an obligatory step of retrovirus replication because proviral DNA is the template for productive infection. Integrase, a retroviral enzyme, catalyses integration. The process of integration can be divided into two sequential reactions. The first one, named 3'-processing, corresponds to a specific endonucleolytic reaction which prepares the viral DNA extremities to be competent for the subsequent covalent insertion, named strand transfer, into the host cell genome by a trans-esterification reaction. Recently, a novel specific activity of the full length integrase was reported, in vitro, by our group for two retroviral integrases (HIV-1 and PFV-1). This activity of internal cleavage occurs at a specific palindromic sequence mimicking the LTR-LTR junction described into the 2-LTR circles which are peculiar viral DNA forms found during viral infection. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated the existence of a weak palindromic consensus found at the integration sites. Taken together, these data underline the propensity of retroviral integrases for binding symmetrical sequences and give perspectives for targeting specific sequences used for gene therapy.
3 Lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells are an innate source of IL-17 and IL-22. The interleukin (IL) 17 family of cytokines has emerged to be critical for host defense as well as the pathogenesis of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, and serves to link adaptive and innate responses. Recent studies have identified a new subset of T cells that selectively produce IL-17 (Th17 cells; Bettelli, E., T. Korn, and V.K. Kuchroo. 2007. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 19:652-657; Kolls, J.K., and A. Linden. 2004. Immunity. 21:467-476), but the regulation of IL-17 production by innate immune cells is less well understood. We report that in vitro stimulation with IL-23 induced IL-17 production by recombination activating gene (Rag) 2(-/-) splenocytes but not Rag2(-/-) common gamma chain(-/-) splenocytes. We found that a major source of IL-17 was CD4(+)CD3(-)NK1.1(-)CD11b(-)Gr1(-)CD11c(-)B220(-) cells, a phenotype that corresponds to lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells (LTi-like cells), which constitutively expressed the IL-23 receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and CCR6. In vivo challenge with the yeast cell wall product zymosan rapidly induced IL-17 production in these cells. Genetic deletion of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 reduced but did not abrogate IL-17 production in LTi-like cells. Thus, it appears that splenic LTi-like cells are a rapid source of IL-17 and IL-22, which might contribute to dynamic organization of secondary lymphoid organ structure or host defense.
3 Antioxidant intervention of smoking-induced lung tumor in mice by vitamin E and quercetin. Epidemiological and in vitro studies suggest that antioxidants such as quercetin and vitamin E (VE) can prevent lung tumor caused by smoking; however, there is limited evidence from animal studies. In the present study, Swiss mouse was used to examine the potential of quercetin and VE for prevention lung tumor induced by smoking. Our results suggest that the incidence of lung tumor and tumor multiplicity were 43.5% and 1.00 +/- 0.29 in smoking group; Quercetin has limited effects on lung tumor prevention in this in vivo model, as measured by assays for free radical scavenging, reduction of smoke-induced DNA damage and inhibition of apoptosis. On the other hand, vitamin E drastically decreased the incidence of lung tumor and tumor multiplicity which were 17.0% and 0.32 +/- 0.16, respectively (p < 0.05); and demonstrated prominent antioxidant effects, reduction of DNA damage and decreased cell apoptosis (p < 0.05). Combined treatment with quercetin and VE in this animal model did not demonstrate any effect greater than that due to vitamin E alone. In addition, gender differences in the occurrence of smoke induced-lung tumor and antioxidant intervention were also observed. We conclude that VE might prevent lung tumor induced by smoking in Swiss mice.
3 EBs clip CLIPs to growing microtubule ends. Proteins that track growing microtubule (MT) ends are important for many aspects of intracellular MT function, but the mechanism by which these +TIPs accumulate at MT ends has been the subject of a long-standing controversy. In this issue, Bieling et al. (Bieling, P., S. Kandels-Lewis, I.A. Telley, J. van Dijk, C. Janke, and T. Surrey. 2008. J. Cell Biol. 183:1223-1233) reconstitute plus end tracking of EB1 and CLIP-170 in vitro, which demonstrates that CLIP-170 plus end tracking is EB1-dependent and that both +TIPs rapidly exchange between a soluble and a plus end-associated pool. This strongly supports the hypothesis that plus end tracking depends on a biochemical property of growing MT ends, and that the characteristic +TIP comets result from the generation of new +TIP binding sites through MT polymerization in combination with the exponential decay of these binding sites.
1 The association of psychiatric comorbidity and use of the emergency department among persons with substance use disorders: an observational cohort study. Psychiatric and substance use problems are commonly found to be contributing factors to frequent Emergency Department (ED) use, yet little research has focused on the association between substance use and psychiatric comorbidity. This study assesses the association of a psychiatric comorbidity on (ED) use among patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). The study focuses on 6,865 patients who were diagnosed with SUDs in the ED of a large urban hospital in the southern United States from January 1994 - June 1998. Patients were grouped by type of substance use disorder. After examining frequency of visits by diagnosis, the sample was assigned to the following groups-alcohol dependence (ICD9 = 303), alcohol abuse (ICD9 = 305.0), cocaine dependence/abuse (ICD9 = 304.2, 305.6), and polysubstance/mixed use (ICD9 = 305.9). A patient was classified with psychiatric comorbidity if a psychiatric diagnosis appeared during any of the patient's visits. The following psychiatric diagnoses were included-schizophrenia/psychoses, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and dementia (ICD-9 codes available upon request). Patients with SUDs and psychiatric comorbidity had significantly higher mean number of ER visits (mean = 5.2 SD = 8.7) than SUD patients without psychiatric comorbidity (mean = 2.5, SD = 3.7). In logistic regressions predicting several categorizations of heavier use of the ED (either 4+, 8+, 12+, 16+, or 20+ visits over the span of the study) SUD patients with psychiatric comorbidity had adjusted odds ratios of 3.0 to 5.6 (reference group = patients with SUDs but no psychiatric comorbidity). This association was found across all substance use diagnostic categories studied, with the strongest relationship observed among patients with cocaine disorders or alcohol dependence. The results provide further support for the notion that the ED could and should serve as an important identification site for cost-effective intervention.
2 Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario (HSFO) high blood pressure strategy's hypertension management initiative study protocol. Achieving control of hypertension prevents target organ damage at both the micro and macrovascular level and is a highly cost effective means of lowering the risk for heart attack and stroke particularly in people with diabetes. Clinical trials demonstrate that blood pressure control can be achieved in a large proportion of people. Translating this knowledge into widespread practice is the focus of the Hypertension Management Initiative, which began in 2004 with the goal of improving the management of this chronic health condition by primary care providers and patients in the community. This study will test the effect of a systems change on the management of high blood pressure in real world practice in primary care in Ontario, Canada. The systems change intervention involves an interprofessional educational program bringing together physicians, nurses and pharmacists with tools for both providers and patients to facilitate blood pressure management. Each of two waves of subjects were enrolled over a 6 month period with the initial enrollment between waves separated by 9 months. Blood pressure will be measured with the BpTru automated blood pressure device. To determine the effectiveness of the intervention, a before and after analysis within all subjects will compare blood pressure at baseline to annual measurements for the three year study. To assess whether the intervention has an impact on blood pressure control independent of community trends, a betwen group comparison of baseline blood pressures in the delayed wave will be made with the immediate wave during the same time period, so that the immediate wave has experienced the intervention for at least 9 months. The total enrollment goal is 5,000 subjects. The practice locations include 10 Family Health Teams (FHTs) and 1 Community Health Centre (CHC) and approximately 49 primary care physicians, 15 nurse practitioners, 37 registered nurses and over 150 community pharmacists across the 11 communities throughout the province of Ontario. The 11 primary care sites will be divided into immediate and delayed groups based on geography and the use of an electronic versus a traditional chart patient record. Initial consideration was given to randomizing the groups, however, for a number of reasons, this was deemed to not be possible. In order to ensure that the sites in the immediate intervention and delayed intervention groups are not different from each other, the sites will be assigned to the intervention groups manually to ensure a distribution of the variables as evenly as possible. Given that HSFO approached this particular group of health care providers to participate in a program relating to hypertension, this may have heightened their awareness of the issue and affected their management of patients with hypertension. Thus, data will be collected to allow an assessment of previous practice patterns and determine any impact of the Hawthorne Effect. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00425828.
1 QuantPrime--a flexible tool for reliable high-throughput primer design for quantitative PCR. Medium- to large-scale expression profiling using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays are becoming increasingly important in genomics research. A major bottleneck in experiment preparation is the design of specific primer pairs, where researchers have to make several informed choices, often outside their area of expertise. Using currently available primer design tools, several interactive decisions have to be made, resulting in lengthy design processes with varying qualities of the assays. Here we present QuantPrime, an intuitive and user-friendly, fully automated tool for primer pair design in small- to large-scale qPCR analyses. QuantPrime can be used online through the internet http://www.quantprime.de/ or on a local computer after download; it offers design and specificity checking with highly customizable parameters and is ready to use with many publicly available transcriptomes of important higher eukaryotic model organisms and plant crops (currently 295 species in total), while benefiting from exon-intron border and alternative splice variant information in available genome annotations. Experimental results with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the crop Hordeum vulgare and the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii show success rates of designed primer pairs exceeding 96%. QuantPrime constitutes a flexible, fully automated web application for reliable primer design for use in larger qPCR experiments, as proven by experimental data. The flexible framework is also open for simple use in other quantification applications, such as hydrolyzation probe design for qPCR and oligonucleotide probe design for quantitative in situ hybridization. Future suggestions made by users can be easily implemented, thus allowing QuantPrime to be developed into a broad-range platform for the design of RNA expression assays.
0 Learning transcriptional regulatory networks from high throughput gene expression data using continuous three-way mutual information. Probability based statistical learning methods such as mutual information and Bayesian networks have emerged as a major category of tools for reverse engineering mechanistic relationships from quantitative biological data. In this work we introduce a new statistical learning strategy, MI3 that addresses three common issues in previous methods simultaneously: (1) handling of continuous variables, (2) detection of more complex three-way relationships and (3) better differentiation of causal versus confounding relationships. With these improvements, we provide a more realistic representation of the underlying biological system. We test the MI3 algorithm using both synthetic and experimental data. In the synthetic data experiment, MI3 achieved an absolute sensitivity/precision of 0.77/0.83 and a relative sensitivity/precision both of 0.99. In addition, MI3 significantly outperformed the control methods, including Bayesian networks, classical two-way mutual information and a discrete version of MI3. We then used MI3 and control methods to infer a regulatory network centered at the MYC transcription factor from a published microarray dataset. Models selected by MI3 were numerically and biologically distinct from those selected by control methods. Unlike control methods, MI3 effectively differentiated true causal models from confounding models. MI3 recovered major MYC cofactors, and revealed major mechanisms involved in MYC dependent transcriptional regulation, which are strongly supported by literature. The MI3 network showed that limited sets of regulatory mechanisms are employed repeatedly to control the expression of large number of genes. Overall, our work demonstrates that MI3 outperforms the frequently used control methods, and provides a powerful method for inferring mechanistic relationships underlying biological and other complex systems. The MI3 method is implemented in R in the "mi3" package, available under the GNU GPL from http://sysbio.engin.umich.edu/~luow/downloads.php and from the R package archive CRAN.
1 Predicting peptide structures in native proteins from physical simulations of fragments. It has long been proposed that much of the information encoding how a protein folds is contained locally in the peptide chain. Here we present a large-scale simulation study designed to examine the extent to which conformations of peptide fragments in water predict native conformations in proteins. We perform replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations of 872 8-mer, 12-mer, and 16-mer peptide fragments from 13 proteins using the AMBER 96 force field and the OBC implicit solvent model. To analyze the simulations, we compute various contact-based metrics, such as contact probability, and then apply Bayesian classifier methods to infer which metastable contacts are likely to be native vs. non-native. We find that a simple measure, the observed contact probability, is largely more predictive of a peptide's native structure in the protein than combinations of metrics or multi-body components. Our best classification model is a logistic regression model that can achieve up to 63% correct classifications for 8-mers, 71% for 12-mers, and 76% for 16-mers. We validate these results on fragments of a protein outside our training set. We conclude that local structure provides information to solve some but not all of the conformational search problem. These results help improve our understanding of folding mechanisms, and have implications for improving physics-based conformational sampling and structure prediction using all-atom molecular simulations.
0 A simplified, robust, and streamlined procedure for the production of C. elegans transgenes via recombineering. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a powerful system to study biologic questions ranging from development to aging. The generation of transgenic animals is an important experimental tool and allows use of GFP fusion proteins to study the expression of genes of interest or generation of epitope tagged versions of specific genes. Transgenes are often generated by placing a promoter upstream of a reporter gene or cDNA. This often produces a representative expression pattern, but important exceptions have been observed. To better capture the genuine expression pattern and timing, several investigators have modified large pieces of DNA carried by BACs or fosmids for use in the construction of transgenic animals via recombineering. However, these techniques are not in widespread use despite the advantages when compared to traditional approaches. Additionally, some groups have encountered problems with employing these techniques. Hence, we sought identify ways to improve the simplicity and reliability of the procedure. We describe here several important modifications we have made to existing protocols to make the procedure simpler and more robust. Among these are the use of galK gene as a selection marker for both the positive and negative selection steps in recombineering, the use of R6K based plasmids which eliminate the need for extensive PCR product purification, a means to integrate the unc-119 marker on to the fosmid backbone, and placement of homology arms to commonly used GFP and TAP fusion genes flanking the galK cassette which reduces the cost of oligos by 50%. We have made several significant changes that allow the production of C. elegans transgenes from a commercially available fosmid library in a robust and streamlined manner. These changes make the technique more attractive especially to small academic labs unfamiliar with recombineering.
3 Dissemination and implementation of suicide prevention training in one Scottish region. As part of a national co-ordinated and multifaceted response to the excess suicide rate, the Choose Life initiative, the Highland Choose Life Group launched an ambitious programme of training for National Health Service (NHS), Council and voluntary organisation staff. In this study of the dissemination and implementation of STORM (Skills-based Training On Risk Management), we set out to explore not only the outcomes of training, but key factors involved in the processes of diffusion, dissemination and implementation of the educational intervention. Participants attending STORM training in Highland Region provided by 12 trained facilitators during the period March 2004 to February 2005 were recruited. Quantitative data collection from participants took place at three time points; immediately before training, immediately post-training and six months after training. Semi-structured telephone interviews were carried out with the training facilitators and with a sample of course participants 6 months after they had been trained. We have utilized the conceptual model described by Greenhalgh and colleagues in a Framework analysis of the data, for considering the determinants of diffusion, dissemination and implementation of interventions in health service delivery and organization. Some 203 individuals completed a series of questionnaire measures immediately pre (time 1) and immediately post (time 2) training and there were significant improvements in attitudes and confidence of participants. Key factors in the diffusion, dissemination and implementation process were the presence of a champion or local opinion leader who supported and directed the intervention, local adaptation of the materials, commissioning of a group of facilitators who were provided with financial and administrative support, dedicated time to provide the training and regular peer-support. Features that contributed to the success of STORM were related to both the context (the multi-dimensional support provided from the host organisation and the favourable policy environment) and the intervention (openness to local adaptation, clinical relevance and utility), and the dynamic interaction between context and the intervention.
0 Exon definition as a potential negative force against intron losses in evolution. Previous studies have indicated that the wide variation in intron density (the number of introns per gene) among different eukaryotes largely reflects varying degrees of intron loss during evolution. The most popular model, which suggests that organisms lose introns through a mechanism in which reverse-transcribed cDNA recombines with the genomic DNA, concerns only one mutational force. Using exons as the units of splicing-site recognition, exon definition constrains the length of exons. An intron-loss event results in fusion of flanking exons and thus a larger exon. The large size of the newborn exon may cause splicing errors, i.e., exon skipping, if the splicing of pre-mRNAs is initiated by exon definition. By contrast, if the splicing of pre-mRNAs is initiated by intron definition, intron loss does not matter. Exon definition may thus be a selective force against intron loss. An organism with a high frequency of exon definition is expected to experience a low rate of intron loss throughout evolution and have a high density of spliceosomal introns. The majority of spliceosomal introns in vertebrates may be maintained during evolution not because of potential functions, but because of their splicing mechanism (i.e., exon definition). Further research is required to determine whether exon definition is a negative force in maintaining the high intron density of vertebrates. This article was reviewed by Dr. Scott W.

2 Monitoring and evaluation of malaria in pregnancy - developing a rational basis for control. Monitoring and evaluation of malaria control in pregnancy is essential for assessing the efficacy and effectiveness of health interventions aimed at reducing the major burden of this disease on women living in endemic areas. Yet there is no currently integrated strategic approach on how this should be achieved. Malaria control in pregnancy is formulated in relation to epidemiological patterns of exposure. Current emphasis is on intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) during pregnancy with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in higher transmission areas, combined with insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) and case management. Emphasis in lower transmission areas is primarily on case management. This paper discusses a rational basis for monitoring and evaluation based on: assessments of therapeutic and prophylactic drug efficacy; proportional reductions in parasite prevalence; seasonal effects; rapid assessment methodologies; birthweight and/or anaemia nomograms; case-coverage methods; maternal mortality indices; operational and programmatic indicators; and safety and pharmacovigilance of antimalarials in pregnancy. These approaches should be incorporated more effectively within National Programmes in order to facilitate surveillance and improve identification of high-risk women. Systems for utilizing routinely collected data should be strengthened, with greater attention to safety and pharmacovigilance with the advent of artemisinin combination therapies, and prospects of inadvertent exposures to artemisinins in the first trimester. Integrating monitoring activities within malaria control, reproductive health and adolescent-friendly services will be critical for implementation. Large-scale operational research is required to further evaluate the validity of currently proposed indicators, and in order to clarify the breadth and scale of implementation to be deployed.
0 A major QTL affects temperature sensitive adult lethality and inbreeding depression in life span in Drosophila melanogaster. The study of inbreeding depression has major relevance for many disciplines, including conservation genetics and evolutionary biology. Still, the molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon remains poorly characterised, as knowledge on the mechanistic causes of inbreeding depression and the molecular properties of genes that give rise to or modulate its deleterious effects is lacking. These questions warrant the detailed study of genetic loci giving rise to inbreeding depression. However, the complex and polygenic nature of general inbreeding depression makes this a daunting task. Study of inbreeding effects in specific traits, such as age-specific mortality and life span, provide a good starting point, as a limited set of genes is expected to be involved. Here we report on a QTL mapping study on inbreeding related and temperature sensitive lethality in male Drosophila melanogaster. The inbreeding effect was expressed at moderately high temperature, and manifested itself as severe premature mortality in males, but not in females. We used a North Carolina crossing design 3 to estimate average dominance ratio and heritability. We found the genetic basis of the lethal effect to be relatively simple, being due mainly to a single recessive QTL on the left arm of chromosome 2. This locus colocalised with a QTL that conditioned variation in female life span, acting as an overdominant locus for this trait. Male life span was additionally affected by variation at the X-chromosome. This demonstrates that analysis of large conditional lethal effects is a viable strategy for delineating genes which are sensitive to inbreeding depression.
3 The trends in prostate specific antigen usage amongst United Kingdom urologists--a questionnaire based study. Worldwide, the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as a screen for prostate cancer is contentious. Whilst there is no National UK Screening programme, many men undergo opportunistic screening. This study investigates UK urologist's usage of PSA and the awareness surrounding the Department of Health (DoH) PSA guidelines. Urologists were sent a questionnaire regarding PSA cut-off values. Of the 733 urologists eligible to participate in this study 346 returned completed questionnaires giving a response rate of 47%. The most commonly generally used age-related PSA cut-off values (36% of respondents) are--3.5 ng/ml for 50 - 59 year olds, 4.5 ng/ml for 60 - 69 year olds and 6.5 ng/ml for over 70 year olds. Two-thirds (58%, 200/346) of respondents were aware of the DoH PSA guidelines but only 20% (n = 69/346) follow these guidelines. The majority of respondents (68%, n = 234/346) used higher PSA cut-offs than recommended by the DoH. The level of compliance showed marked regional variation with a range from 7% to 44% (median 19%). In addition, it was apparent that lower PSA cut-off values were used in private practice as opposed to the National Health Service. A nationwide lack of agreement on PSA cut-off values may generate a variable standard of care both regionally and in NHS versus private practice. Generally, higher PSA cut-off values are being used than recommended by the DoH guidance.
1 Reduced glomerular filtration rate and its association with clinical outcome in older patients at risk of vascular events: secondary analysis. Reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in young and middle aged individuals. Associations with cardiovascular disease and mortality in older people are less clearly established. We aimed to determine the predictive value of the GFR for mortality and morbidity using data from the 5,804 participants randomized in the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER). Glomerular filtration rate was estimated (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation and was categorized in the ranges ([20-40], [40-50], [50-60]) >or= 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Baseline risk factors were analysed by category of eGFR, with and without adjustment for other risk factors. The associations between baseline eGFR and morbidity and mortality outcomes, accrued after an average of 3.2 y, were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for traditional risk factors. We tested for evidence of an interaction between the benefit of statin treatment and baseline eGFR status. Age, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, C-reactive protein (CRP), body mass index, fasting glucose, female sex, histories of hypertension and vascular disease were associated with eGFR (p = 0.001 or less) after adjustment for other risk factors. Low eGFR was independently associated with risk of all cause mortality, vascular mortality, and other noncancer mortality and with fatal and nonfatal coronary and heart failure events (hazard ratios adjusted for CRP and other risk factors (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for eGFR < 40 ml/min/1.73m(2) relative to eGFR >or= 60 ml/min/1.73m(2) respectively 2.04 (1.48-2.80), 2.37 (1.53-3.67), 3.52 (1.78-6.96), 1.64 (1.18-2.27), 3.31 (2.03-5.41). There were no nominally statistically significant interactions (p < 0.05) between randomized treatment allocation and eGFR for clinical outcomes, with the exception of the outcome of coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (p = 0.021), with the interaction suggesting increased benefit of statin treatment in subjects with impaired GFRs. We have established that, in an elderly population over the age of 70 y, impaired GFR is associated with female sex, with presence of vascular disease, and with levels of other risk factors that would be associated with increased risk of vascular disease. Further, impaired GFR is independently associated with significant levels of increased risk of all cause mortality and fatal vascular events and with composite fatal and nonfatal coronary and heart failure outcomes. Our analyses of the benefits of statin treatment in relation to baseline GFR suggest that there is no reason to exclude elderly patients with impaired renal function from treatment with a statin.
3 The translocator maintenance protein Tam41 is required for mitochondrial cardiolipin biosynthesis. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains different translocator systems for the import of presequence-carrying proteins and carrier proteins. The translocator assembly and maintenance protein 41 (Tam41/mitochondrial matrix protein 37) was identified as a new member of the mitochondrial protein translocator systems by its role in maintaining the integrity and activity of the presequence translocase of the inner membrane (TIM23 complex). Here we demonstrate that the assembly of proteins imported by the carrier translocase, TIM22 complex, is even more strongly affected by the lack of Tam41. Moreover, respiratory chain supercomplexes and the inner membrane potential are impaired by lack of Tam41. The phenotype of Tam41-deficient mitochondria thus resembles that of mitochondria lacking cardiolipin. Indeed, we found that Tam41 is required for the biosynthesis of the dimeric phospholipid cardiolipin. The pleiotropic effects of the translocator maintenance protein on preprotein import and respiratory chain can be attributed to its role in biosynthesis of mitochondrial cardiolipin.
0 Adult and embryonic GAD transcripts are spatiotemporally regulated during postnatal development in the rat brain. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, is synthesized by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). GAD exists in two adult isoforms, GAD65 and GAD67. During embryonic brain development at least two additional transcripts exist, I-80 and I-86, which are distinguished by insertions of 80 or 86 bp into GAD67 mRNA, respectively. Though it was described that embryonic GAD67 transcripts are not detectable during adulthood there are evidences suggesting re-expression under certain pathological conditions in the adult brain. In the present study we systematically analyzed for the first time the spatiotemporal distribution of different GADs with emphasis on embryonic GAD67 mRNAs in the postnatal brain using highly sensitive methods. QPCR was used to precisely investigate the postnatal expression level of GAD related mRNAs in cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb of rats from P1 throughout adulthood. Within the first three postnatal weeks the expression of both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs reached adult levels in hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum. The olfactory bulb showed by far the highest expression of GAD65 as well as GAD67 transcripts. Embryonic GAD67 splice variants were still detectable at birth. They continuously declined to barely detectable levels during postnatal development in all investigated regions with exception of a comparatively high expression in the olfactory bulb. Radioactive in situ hybridizations confirmed the occurrence of embryonic GAD67 transcripts in the olfactory bulb and furthermore detected their localization mainly in the subventricular zone and the rostral migratory stream. Embryonic GAD67 transcripts can hardly be detected in the adult brain, except for specific regions associated with neurogenesis and high synaptic plasticity. Therefore a functional role in processes like proliferation, migration or synaptogenesis is suggested.
0 A genome-wide Asian genetic map and ethnic comparison: the GENDISCAN study. Genetic maps provide specific positions of genetic markers, which are required for performing genetic studies. Linkage analyses of Asian families have been performed with Caucasian genetic maps, since appropriate genetic maps of Asians were not available. Different ethnic groups may have different recombination rates as a result of genomic variations, which would generate misspecification of the genetic map and reduce the power of linkage analyses. We constructed the genetic map of a Mongolian population in Asia with CRIMAP software. This new map, called the GENDISCAN map, is based on genotype data collected from 1026 individuals of 73 large Mongolian families, and includes 1790 total and 1500 observable meioses. The GENDISCAN map provides sex-averaged and sex-specific genetic positions of 1039 microsatellite markers in Kosambi centimorgans (cM) with physical positions. We also determined 95% confidence intervals of genetic distances of the adjacent marker intervals. Genetic lengths of the whole genome, chromosomes and adjacent marker intervals are compared with those of Rutgers Map v.2, which was constructed based on Caucasian populations (Centre d'Etudes du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) and Icelandic families) by mapping methods identical to those of the GENDISCAN map, CRIMAP software and the Kosambi map function. Mongolians showed approximately 1.9 fewer recombinations per meiosis than Caucasians. As a result, genetic lengths of the whole genome and chromosomes of the GENDISCAN map are shorter than those of Rutgers Map v.2. Thirty-eight marker intervals differed significantly between the Mongolian and Caucasian genetic maps. The new GENDISCAN map is applicable to the genetic study of Asian populations. Differences in the genetic distances between the GENDISCAN and Caucasian maps could facilitate elucidation of genomic variations between different ethnic groups.
0 Roles for proteinases in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Since the early 1960s, a compelling body of evidence has accumulated to show that proteinases play critical roles in airspace enlargement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, until recently the causative enzymes and their exact roles in pathologic processes in COPD have not been clear. Recent studies of gene-targeted mice in murine models of COPD have confirmed roles for proteinases not only in airspace enlargement, but also in airway pathologies in COPD. These studies have also shed light on the specific proteinases involved in COPD pathogenesis, and the mechanisms by which these proteinases injure the lung. They have also identified important interactions between different classes of proteinases, and between proteinases and other molecules that amplify lung inflammation and injury. This review will discuss the biology of proteinases and the mechanisms by which they contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD. In addition, I will discuss the potential of proteinase inhibitors and anti-inflammatory drugs as new treatment strategies for COPD patients.
3 Serial analysis of gene expression reveals differential expression between endometriosis and normal endometrium. Possible roles for AXL and SHC1 in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a clinical condition that affects up to 10% of the women of reproductive age. Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissues outside the uterine cavity and can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility and, in some cases, to ovarian cancer. In order to better understand the pathogenesis of endometriosis, we have used Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to identify genes differentially in this disease by studying three endometriotic tissues and a normal endometrium sample. Promising candidates (AXL, SHC1, ACTN4, PI3KCA, p-AKT, p-mTOR, and p-ERK) were independently validated by immunohistochemistry in additional normal and endometriotic tissues. We identified several genes differentially expressed between endometriosis and normal endometrium. IGF2, ACTN4, AXL, and SHC1 were among the most upregulated genes. Comparison of the endometriosis gene expression profiles with the gene expression patterns observed in normal human tissues allowed the identification of endometriosis-specific genes, which included several members of the MMP family (MMP1,2,3,10,11,14). Immunohistochemical analysis of several candidates confirmed the SAGE findings, and suggested the involvement of the PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways in endometriosis. In human endometriosis, the PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways may be activated via overexpression of AXL and SHC1, respectively. These genes, as well as others identified as differentially expressed in this study, may be useful for the development of novel strategies for the detection and/or therapy of endometriosis.
1 How healthy are chronically ill patients after eight years of homeopathic treatment?--Results from a long term observational study. Homeopathy is a highly debated but often used medical treatment. With this cohort study we aimed to evaluate health status changes under homeopathic treatment in routine care. Here we extend former results, now presenting data of an 8-year follow-up. In a prospective, multicentre cohort study with 103 homeopathic primary care practices in Germany and Switzerland, data from all patients (age >1 year) consulting the physician for the first time were observed. The main outcome measures were: The patients' perceived change in complaint severity (numeric rating scales from 0 = no complaint to 10 = maximal severity) and quality of life as measured by the SF-36 at baseline, and after 2 and 8 years. A total of 3,709 patients were studied, 73% (2,722 adults, 72.8% female, age at baseline 41.0 +/- 12.3; 819 children, 48.4% female, age 6.5 +/- 4.0) contributed data to the 8-year follow-up. The most frequent diagnoses were allergic rhinitis and headache in adults, and atopic dermatitis and multiple recurrent infections in children. Disease severity decreased significantly (p < 0.001) between baseline, 2 and 8 years (adults from 6.2 +/- 1.7 to 2.9 +/- 2.2 and 2.7 +/- 2.1; children from 6.1 +/- 1.8 to 2.1 +/- 2.0 and 1.7 +/- 1.9). Physical and mental quality of life sores also increased considerably. Younger age, female gender and more severe disease at baseline were factors predictive of better therapeutic success. Patients who seek homeopathic treatment are likely to improve considerably. These effects persist for as long as 8 years.
3 Study on the social adaptation of Chinese children with down syndrome. To evaluate social adjustment and related factors among Chinese children with Down syndrome (DS). A structured interview and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) were conducted with a group of 36 DS children with a mean age of 106.28 months, a group of 30 normally-developing children matched for mental age (MA) and a group of 40 normally-developing children matched for chronological age (CA). Mean scores of social adjustment were compared between the three groups, and partial correlations and stepwise multiple regression models were used to further explore related factors. There was no difference between the DS group and the MA group in terms of communication skills. However, the DS group scored much better than the MA group in self-dependence, locomotion, work skills, socialization and self-management. Children in the CA group achieved significantly higher scores in all aspects of social adjustment than the DS children. Partial correlations indicate a relationship between social adjustment and the PPVT raw score and also between social adjustment and age (significant r ranging between 0.24 and 0.92). A stepwise linear regression analysis showed that family structure was the main predictor of social adjustment. Newborn history was also a predictor of work skills, communication, socialization and self-management. Parental education was found to account for 8% of self-dependence. Maternal education explained 6% of the variation in locomotion. Although limited by the small sample size, these results indicate that Chinese DS children have better social adjustment skills when compared to their mental-age-matched normally-developing peers, but that the Chinese DS children showed aspects of adaptive development that differed from Western DS children. Analyses of factors related to social adjustment suggest that effective early intervention may improve social adaptability.
1 Viral discovery and sequence recovery using DNA microarrays. Because of the constant threat posed by emerging infectious diseases and the limitations of existing approaches used to identify new pathogens, there is a great demand for new technological methods for viral discovery. We describe herein a DNA microarray-based platform for novel virus identification and characterization. Central to this approach was a DNA microarray designed to detect a wide range of known viruses as well as novel members of existing viral families; this microarray contained the most highly conserved 70mer sequences from every fully sequenced reference viral genome in GenBank. During an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in March 2003, hybridization to this microarray revealed the presence of a previously uncharacterized coronavirus in a viral isolate cultivated from a SARS patient. To further characterize this new virus, approximately 1 kb of the unknown virus genome was cloned by physically recovering viral sequences hybridized to individual array elements. Sequencing of these fragments confirmed that the virus was indeed a new member of the coronavirus family. This combination of array hybridization followed by direct viral sequence recovery should prove to be a general strategy for the rapid identification and characterization of novel viruses and emerging infectious disease.
0 Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. The consensus algorithm for the medical management of type 2 diabetes was published in August 2006 with the expectation that it would be updated, based on the availability of new interventions and new evidence to establish their clinical role. The authors continue to endorse the principles used to develop the algorithm and its major features. We are sensitive to the risks of changing the algorithm cavalierly or too frequently, without compelling new information. An update to the consensus algorithm published in January 2008 specifically addressed safety issues surrounding the thiazolidinediones. In this revision, we focus on the new classes of medications that now have more clinical data and experience.
3 The human neonatal small intestine has the potential for arginine synthesis; developmental changes in the expression of arginine-synthesizing and -catabolizing enzymes. Milk contains too little arginine for normal growth, but its precursors proline and glutamine are abundant; the small intestine of rodents and piglets produces arginine from proline during the suckling period; and parenterally fed premature human neonates frequently suffer from hypoargininemia. These findings raise the question whether the neonatal human small intestine also expresses the enzymes that enable the synthesis of arginine from proline and/or glutamine. Carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CPS), ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), arginase-1 (ARG1), arginase-2 (ARG2), and nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) were visualized by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry in 89 small-intestinal specimens. Between 23 weeks of gestation and 3 years after birth, CPS- and ASS-protein content in enterocytes was high and then declined to reach adult levels at 5 years. OAT levels declined more gradually, whereas ARG-1 was not expressed. ARG-2 expression increased neonatally to adult levels. Neurons in the enteric plexus strongly expressed ASS, OAT, NOS1 and ARG2, while varicose nerve fibers in the circular layer of the muscularis propria stained for ASS and NOS1 only. The endothelium of small arterioles expressed ASS and NOS3, while their smooth-muscle layer expressed OAT and ARG2. The human small intestine acquires the potential to produce arginine well before fetuses become viable outside the uterus. The perinatal human intestine therefore resembles that of rodents and pigs. Enteral ASS behaves as a typical suckling enzyme because its expression all but disappears in the putative weaning period of human infants.
3 Bacterial networking. A report of the ESF-EMBO Symposium Bacterial Networks (BacNet08), Sant Feliu de Guixols, Spain, 13-18 September 2008.
1 Fasting plasma C-peptide and micro- and macrovascular complications in a large clinic-based cohort of type 1 diabetic patients. A protective effect of residual beta-cell function on microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes has been suggested. Our aim was to retrospectively evaluate the association of fasting plasma C-peptide values with micro- and macrovascular complications. We recruited a clinic-based cohort of 471 type 1 diabetic patients born after 1945 and cared for in the period 1994-2004. Centralized measurements and standardized procedures of ascertainment of micro- and macrovascular complications were employed. Individual cumulative averages of A1C up to 2007 were calculated. Residual beta-cell secretion was detected even many years after diabetes diagnosis. In multivariate linear regression analysis, fasting plasma C-peptide values were positively associated with age at diagnosis (beta = 0.02; P < 0.0001) and triglycerides (beta = 0.20; P = 0.05) and inversely associated with diabetes duration (beta = -0.03; P < 0.0001) and HDL cholesterol (beta = -0.006; P = 0.03). The final model explained 21% of fasting C-peptide variability. With respect to fasting C-peptide values in the lowest tertile (<0.06 nmol/l), higher values were associated with lower prevalence of microvascular complications (odds ratio [OR] 0.59 [95% CI 0.37-0.94]) independently of age, sex, diabetes duration, individual cumulative A1C average during the study period, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. No association was evident with macrovascular complications (0.77 [0.38-1.58]). Our study shows an independent protective effect of residual beta-cell function on the development of microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes, suggesting the potential beneficial effect of treatment that allows the preservation of even modest beta-cell function over time.
1 Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study: associations with neonatal anthropometrics. To examine associations of neonatal adiposity with maternal glucose levels and cord serum C-peptide in a multicenter multinational study, the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study, thereby assessing the Pederson hypothesis linking maternal glycemia and fetal hyperinsulinemia to neonatal adiposity. Eligible pregnant women underwent a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test between 24 and 32 weeks gestation (as close to 28 weeks as possible). Neonatal anthropometrics and cord serum C-peptide were measured. Associations of maternal glucose and cord serum C-peptide with neonatal adiposity (sum of skin folds >90th percentile or percent body fat >90th percentile) were assessed using multiple logistic regression analyses, with adjustment for potential confounders, including maternal age, parity, BMI, mean arterial pressure, height, gestational age at delivery, and the baby's sex. Among 23,316 HAPO Study participants with glucose levels blinded to caregivers, cord serum C-peptide results were available for 19,885 babies and skin fold measurements for 19,389. For measures of neonatal adiposity, there were strong statistically significant gradients across increasing levels of maternal glucose and cord serum C-peptide, which persisted after adjustment for potential confounders. In fully adjusted continuous variable models, odds ratios ranged from 1.35 to 1.44 for the two measures of adiposity for fasting, 1-h, and 2-h plasma glucose higher by 1 SD. These findings confirm the link between maternal glucose and neonatal adiposity and suggest that the relationship is mediated by fetal insulin production and that the Pedersen hypothesis describes a basic biological relationship influencing fetal growth.
2 Cytomegalovirus retinitis after intravitreous triamcinolone injection in a patient with central retinal vein occlusion. To report a case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis after intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA). A 77-year-old woman with macular edema due to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) developed peripheral retinitis 4 months after IVTA. A diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis was performed to obtain DNA for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for viral retinitis. The PCR test was positive for CMV DNA. Other tests for infective uveitis and immune competence were negative. Four months after presentation, gancyclovir was intravitreously injected a total of 5 times, and the retinitis resolved completely. CMV retinitis is a rare complication of local immunosuppression with IVTA. It can be managed with timely injection of intravitreal gancyclovir until recovery from local immunosuppression.
3 Glucose and pharmacological modulators of ATP-sensitive K+ channels control [Ca2+]c by different mechanisms in isolated mouse alpha-cells. We studied how glucose and ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel modulators affect alpha-cell [Ca(2+)](c). GYY mice (expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein in alpha-cells) and NMRI mice were used. [Ca(2+)](c), the K(ATP) current (I(KATP), perforated mode) and cell metabolism [NAD(P)H fluorescence] were monitored in single alpha-cells and, for comparison, in single beta-cells. In 0.5 mmol/l glucose, [Ca(2+)](c) oscillated in some alpha-cells and was basal in the others. Increasing glucose to 15 mmol/l decreased [Ca(2+)](c) by approximately 30% in oscillating cells and was ineffective in the others. alpha-Cell I(KATP) was inhibited by tolbutamide and activated by diazoxide or the mitochondrial poison azide, as in beta-cells. Tolbutamide increased alpha-cell [Ca(2+)](c), whereas diazoxide and azide abolished [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations. Increasing glucose from 0.5 to 15 mmol/l did not change I(KATP) and NAD(P)H fluorescence in alpha-cells in contrast to beta-cells. The use of nimodipine showed that L-type Ca(2+) channels are the main conduits for Ca(2+) influx in alpha-cells. gamma-Aminobutyric acid and zinc did not decrease alpha-cell [Ca(2+)](c), and insulin, although lowering [Ca(2+)](c) very modestly, did not affect glucagon secretion. alpha-Cells display similarities with beta-cells: K(ATP) channels control Ca(2+) influx mainly through L-type Ca(2+) channels. However, alpha-cells have distinct features from beta-cells: Most K(ATP) channels are already closed at low glucose, glucose does not affect cell metabolism and I(KATP), and it slightly decreases [Ca(2+)](c). Hence, glucose and K(ATP) channel modulators exert distinct effects on alpha-cell [Ca(2+)](c). The direct small glucose-induced drop in alpha-cell [Ca(2+)](c) contributes likely only partly to the strong glucose-induced inhibition of glucagon secretion in islets.
1 Ecological factors associated with West Nile virus transmission, northeastern United States. Since 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) disease has affected the northeastern United States. To describe the spatial epidemiology and identify risk factors for disease incidence, we analyzed 8 years (1999-2006) of county-based human WNV disease surveillance data. Among the 56.6 million residents in 8 northeastern states sharing primary enzootic vectors, we found 977 cases. We controlled for population density and potential bias from surveillance and spatial proximity. Analyses demonstrated significant spatial spreading from 1999 through 2004 (p<0.01, r2 = 0.16). A significant trend was apparent among increasingly urban counties; county quartiles with the least (<38%) forest cover had 4.4-fold greater odds (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-13.2, p = 0.01) of having above-median disease incidence (>0.75 cases/100,000 residents) than counties with the most (>70%) forest cover. These results quantify urbanization as a risk factor for WNV disease incidence and are consistent with knowledge of vector species in this area.
3 Species distribution and susceptibility to azole antifungals of Candida bloodstream isolates from eight university hospitals in Korea. The incidence of Candida bloodstream infections (BSI) has increased over the past two decades. The rank order of occurrence and the susceptibility to antifungals of the various Candida species causing BSI are important factors driving the establishment of empirical treatment protocols; however, very limited multi-institutional data are available on Candida bloodstream isolates in Korea. We investigated the susceptibility to azole antifungals and species distribution of 143 Candida bloodstream isolates recovered from eight university hospitals over a six-month period. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole for each isolate were determined by the broth microdilution method of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The Candida species recovered most frequently from the blood cultures was C. albicans (49%), followed by C. parapsilosis (22%), C. tropicalis (14%), and C. glabrata (11%). The MIC ranges for the Candida isolates were 0.125 to 64 microg/mL for fluconazole, 0.03 to 2 microg/mL for itraconazole, and 0.03 to 1 microg/mL for voriconazole. Overall, resistance to fluconazole was found in only 2% of the Candida isolates (3/143), while the dose-dependent susceptibility was found in 6% (8/143). The resistance and dose-dependent susceptibility of itraconazole were found in 4% (6/143) and 14% (20/143) of the isolates, respectively. All bloodstream isolates were susceptible to voriconazole (MIC, < or = 1 microg/mL). Our findings show that C. albicans is the most common cause of Candida-related BSI, followed by C. parapsilosis, and that the rates of resistance to azole antifungals are still low among bloodstream isolates in Korea.
0 Simple sequence repeat markers useful for sorghum downy mildew (Peronosclerospora sorghi) and related species. A recent outbreak of sorghum downy mildew in Texas has led to the discovery of both metalaxyl resistance and a new pathotype in the causal organism, Peronosclerospora sorghi. These observations and the difficulty in resolving among phylogenetically related downy mildew pathogens dramatically point out the need for simply scored markers in order to differentiate among isolates and species, and to study the population structure within these obligate oomycetes. Here we present the initial results from the use of a biotin capture method to discover, clone and develop PCR primers that permit the use of simple sequence repeats (microsatellites) to detect differences at the DNA level. Among the 55 primers pairs designed from clones from pathotype 3 of P. sorghi, 36 flanked microsatellite loci containing simple repeats, including 28 (55%) with dinucleotide repeats and 6 (11%) with trinucleotide repeats. A total of 22 microsatellites with CA/AC or GT/TG repeats were the most abundant (40%) and GA/AG or CT/TC types contribute 15% in our collection. When used to amplify DNA from 19 isolates from P. sorghi, as well as from 5 related species that cause downy mildew on other hosts, the number of different bands detected for each SSR primer pair using a LI-COR- DNA Analyzer ranged from two to eight. Successful cross-amplification for 12 primer pairs studied in detail using DNA from downy mildews that attack maize (P. maydis & P. philippinensis), sugar cane (P. sacchari), pearl millet (Sclerospora graminicola) and rose (Peronospora sparsa) indicate that the flanking regions are conserved in all these species. A total of 15 SSR amplicons unique to P. philippinensis (one of the potential threats to US maize production) were detected, and these have potential for development of diagnostic tests. A total of 260 alleles were obtained using 54 microsatellites primer combinations, with an average of 4.8 polymorphic markers per SSR across 34 Peronosclerospora, Peronospora and Sclerospora spp isolates studied. Cluster analysis by UPGMA as well as principal coordinate analysis (PCA) grouped the 34 isolates into three distinct groups (all 19 isolates of Peronosclerospora sorghi in cluster I, five isolates of P. maydis and three isolates of P. sacchari in cluster II and five isolates of Sclerospora graminicola in cluster III). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to extensively develop SSR markers from Peronosclerospora genomic DNA. The newly developed SSR markers can be readily used to distinguish isolates within several species of the oomycetes that cause downy mildew diseases. Also, microsatellite fragments likely include retrotransposon regions of DNA and these sequences can serve as useful genetic markers for strain identification, due to their degree of variability and their widespread occurrence among sorghum, maize, sugarcane, pearl millet and rose downy mildew isolates.
3 Quality and availability of consumer information on heart failure in Australia. Provision of consumer information and patient education are considered an essential part of chronic disease management programmes developed for patients with heart failure. This study aimed to review the quality and availability of consumer information materials for people with heart failure in Australia. The availability of consumer information was assessed through a questionnaire-based survey of the major organisations in Australia known, or thought, to be producing or using consumer materials on heart failure, including hospitals. The questionnaire was designed to explore issues around the use, production and dissemination of consumer materials. Only groups that had produced consumer information on heart failure were asked to complete the totality of the questionnaire.The quality of information booklets was assessed by using a standardised checklist. Of 101 organisations which were sent a questionnaire, 33 had produced 61 consumer resources on heart failure including 21 information booklets, 3 videos, 5 reminder fridge magnets, 7 websites, 15 self-management diaries and 10 self-management plans. Questionnaires were completed for 40 separate information resources. Most had been produced by hospitals or health services. Two information booklets had been translated into other languages. There were major gaps in the availability of these resources as more than half of the resources were developed in 2 of the 8 Australian states and territories, New South Wales and Victoria.Quality assessment of 19 information booklets showed that most had good presentation and language. Overall eight high quality booklets were identified. There were gaps in terms of topics covered, provision of references, quantitative information about treatment outcomes and quality and level of scientific evidence to support medical recommendations. In only one case was there evidence that consumers had been involved in the production of the booklets. Key findings arising from the study included the need to develop a nationally coordinated approach for increasing the dissemination of information resources on heart failure. While the more recent publication of a booklet by the National Heart Foundation may have improved the situation, dissemination of written information materials may remain sub-optimal, especially among patients who are not enrolled in chronic heart failure management programmes.
0 Delineation of early attentional control difficulties in fragile X syndrome: focus on neurocomputational changes. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is due to the silencing of a single X-linked gene and it is associated with striking attentional difficulties. As FXS is well characterised at the cellular level, the condition provides a unique opportunity to investigate how a genetic dysfunction can impact on the development of neurocomputational properties relevant to attention. Thirteen young boys with FXS and 13 mental-age-matched typically developing controls performed a touch-screen-based search task that manipulated the similarity between targets and distractors and their heterogeneity in size. Search speed, path and errors were recorded as multiple measures of performance. Children did not differ in overall search speed or path when searching amongst distractors, but striking error patterns distinguished children with FXS from controls. Firstly, although clear markers of previously found targets remained on screen, children with FXS perseverated on touching previous hits more than typically developing controls, consistent with the well-documented inhibitory deficits in adults with the disorder. Secondly, they could accurately discriminate single target-distractor pairs, but, when searching a complex display, they touched distractors more often than control children when distractors were similar to targets and especially so when these were infrequent, highlighting difficulties in judging relative size and allocate attentional weight independently of stimulus frequency. Thirdly, their performance was also characterised by inaccuracies in pointing, suggesting additional motor control deficits. Taken together, the findings suggest that fragile X syndrome affects the early development of multiple processes contributing to efficient attentional selection, as would be predicted from an understanding of the neurocomputational changes associated with the disorder.
3 Strong eukaryotic IRESs have weak secondary structure. The objective of this work was to investigate the hypothesis that eukaryotic Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES) lack secondary structure and to examine the generality of the hypothesis. IRESs of the yeast and the fruit fly are located in the 5'UTR immediately upstream of the initiation codon. The minimum folding energy (MFE) of 60 nt RNA segments immediately upstream of the initiation codons was calculated as a proxy of secondary structure stability. MFE of the reverse complements of these 60 nt segments was also calculated. The relationship between MFE and empirically determined IRES activity was investigated to test the hypothesis that strong IRES activity is associated with weak secondary structure. We show that IRES activity in the yeast and the fruit fly correlates strongly with the structural stability, with highest IRES activity found in RNA segments that exhibit the weakest secondary structure. We found that a subset of eukaryotic IRESs exhibits very low secondary structure in the 5'-UTR sequences immediately upstream of the initiation codon. The consistency in results between the yeast and the fruit fly suggests a possible shared mechanism of cap-independent translation initiation that relies on an unstructured RNA segment.
1 G-spots cause incorrect expression measurement in Affymetrix microarrays. High Density Oligonucleotide arrays (HDONAs), such as the Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip, use sets of probes chosen to match specified genes, with the expectation that if a particular gene is highly expressed then all the probes in that gene's probe set will provide a consistent message signifying the gene's presence. However, probes that contain a G-spot (a sequence of four or more guanines) behave abnormally and it has been suggested that these probes are responding to some biochemical effect such as the formation of G-quadruplexes. We have tested this expectation by examining the correlation coefficients between pairs of probes using the data on thousands of arrays that are available in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. We confirm the finding that G-spot probes are poorly correlated with others in their probesets and reveal that, by contrast, they are highly correlated with one another. We demonstrate that the correlation is most marked when the G-spot is at the 5' end of the probe. Since these G-spot probes generally show little correlation with the other members of their probesets they are not fit for purpose and their values should be excluded when calculating gene expression values. This has serious implications, since more than 40% of the probesets in the HG-U133A GeneChip contain at least one such probe. Future array designs should avoid these untrustworthy probes.
3 Anti-proliferative effects of Bifidobacterium adolescentis SPM0212 extract on human colon cancer cell lines. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are beneficial probiotic organisms that contribute to improved nutrition, microbial balance, and immuno-enhancement of the intestinal tract, as well as anti-tumor activity. The aim of the present work was to study the growth inhibition of tumor cells by butanol extract of Bifidobacterium adolescentis isolated from healthy young Koreans. The anti-proliferative activity of B. adolescentis isolates was assessed by XTT assays on three human colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2, HT-29, and SW480). The effects of B. adolescentis SPM0212 butanol extract on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) production were tested using the murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line. The butanol extract of B. adolescentis SPM0212 dose-dependently inhibited the growth of Caco-2, HT-29, and SW480 cells by 70%, 30%, and 40%, respectively, at 200 microg/mL. Additionally, the butanol extract of B. adolescentis SPM0212 induced macrophage activation and significantly increased the production of TNF-alpha and NO, which regulate immune modulation and are cytotoxic to tumor cells. The butanol extract of B. adolescentis SPM0212 increased activity of the host immune system and may improve human health by helping to prevent colon cancer as a biological response modifier.
1 Lack of TAR-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) pathology in human prion diseases. TAR-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is the major ubiquitinated protein in the aggregates in frontotemporal dementia with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions and motor neurone disease. Abnormal TDP-43 immunoreactivity has also been described in Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body diseases and Guam parkinsonism-dementia complex. We therefore aimed to determine whether there is TDP-43 pathology in human prion diseases, which are characterised by variable deposition of prion protein (PrP) aggregates in the brain as amyloid plaques or more diffuse deposits. TDP-43, ubiquitin and PrP were analysed by immunohistochemistry and double-labelling immunofluorescence, in sporadic, acquired and inherited forms of human prion disease. Most PrP plaques contained ubiquitin, while synaptic PrP deposits were not associated with ubiquitin. No abnormal TDP-43 inclusions were identified in any type of prion disease case, and TDP-43 did not co-localize with ubiquitin-positive PrP plaques or with diffuse PrP aggregates. These data do not support a role for TDP-43 in prion disease pathogenesis and argue that TDP-43 inclusions define a distinct group of neurodegenerative disorders.
0 Vessel shrinkage as a sign of atherosclerosis progression in type 2 diabetes: a serial intravascular ultrasound analysis. The aim of this study was to determine the natural history of vascular remodeling of atherosclerotic plaques in patients with type 2 diabetes and the predictors of vessel shrinkage. In this serial intracoronary ultrasound (IVUS) study, 237 coronary segments from 45 patients enrolled in the DIABETES I, II, and III trials were included. Quantitative volumetric IVUS analyses (motorized pullbacks at 0.5 mm/s) were performed in the same coronary segment after the index procedure and at the 9-month follow-up. Nontreated mild lesions (angiographic stenosis <25%) with > or =0.5 mm plaque thickening and length of > or =5 mm assessed by IVUS were included. Vessel shrinkage was defined as a Deltaexternal elastic membrane area/Deltaplaque area < 0. Statistical adjustment by multiple segments and multiple lesions per patient was performed. Vessel shrinkage was identified in 37.1% of segments and was associated with a significant decrease in lumen area at 9 months (vessel shrinkage, 10 +/- 4 mm(2) vs. non-vessel shrinkage, 11 +/- 4 mm(2); P = 0.04). Independent predictors of vessel shrinkage were insulin requirements (odds ratio 4.6 [95% CI 1.40-15.10]; P = 0.01), glycated hemoglobin (1.5 [1.05-2.10]; P = 0.02), apolipoprotein B (0.96 [0.94-0.98]; P < 0.001), hypertension (3.7 [1.40-10.30]; P = 0.009), number of diseased vessels (5.6 [2.50-12.50]; P < 0.001), and prior revascularization (17.5 [6.50-46.90]; P < 0.001). This serial IVUS study suggests that progression of coronary artery disease in patients with type 2 diabetes may be mainly attributed to vessel shrinkage. Besides, vessel shrinkage is influenced by insulin requirements and metabolic control and is associated with more advanced coronary atherosclerosis.
2 Percutaneous management of ureteral injuries that are diagnosed late after cesarean section. We wanted to present the results of percutaneous management of ureteral injuries that were diagnosed late after cesarean sections (CS). Twenty-two cases with 24 ureteral injuries that were diagnosed late after CS underwent percutaneous nephrostomy (PN), antegrade double J (DJ) catheter placement and balloon dilatation or a combination of these. The time for making the diagnosis was 21 +/- 50.1 days. The injury site was the distal ureter in all cases (the left ureter: 13, the right ureter: 7 and bilateral: 2). Fifteen complete ureteral obstructions were detected in 13 cases. Ureteral leakage due to partial (n = 4) or complete (n = 3) rupture was noted in seven cases. Two cases had ureterovaginal fistula. All the cases were initially confirmed with antegrade pyelography and afterwards they underwent percutaneous nephrostomy. Balloon dilatation was needed in three cases. Antegrade DJ stents were placed in 10 cases, including the three cases with balloon dilatation. Repetition of percutaneous nephrostomy with balloon dilatation and DJ stent placement was needed in one case with complete obstruction. All the cases were followed-up with US in their first week and then monthly thereafter for up to two years. Eighteen ureters (75%) were managed by percutaneous procedures alone. A total of six ureter injuries had to undergo surgery (25%). Percutaneous management is a good alternative for the treatment of post-CS ureteral injuries that are diagnosed late after CS. Percutaneous management is at least preparatory for a quarter of the cases where surgery is unavoidable.
1 Pre-hospital treatment of acute poisonings in Oslo. Poisoned patients are often treated in and discharged from pre-hospital health care settings. Studies of poisonings should therefore not only include hospitalized patients. To describe the acutely poisoned patients treated by ambulance personnel and in an outpatient clinic; compare patients transferred to a higher treatment level with those discharged without transfer; and study the one-week mortality after pre-hospital discharge. A one-year multi-centre study with prospective inclusion of all acutely poisoned patients > or = 16 years of age treated in ambulances, an outpatient clinic, and hospitals in Oslo. A total of 3757 health service contacts from 2997 poisoning episodes were recorded: 1860 were treated in ambulances, of which 15 died and 750 (40%) were discharged without transfer; 956 were treated in outpatient clinic, of which 801 (84%) were discharged without transfer; and 941 episodes were treated in hospitals. Patients discharged alive after ambulance treatment were mainly poisoned by opiates (70%), were frequently comatose (35%), had respiratory depression (37%), and many received naloxone (49%). The majority of the patients discharged from the outpatient clinic were poisoned by ethanol (55%), fewer were comatose (10%), and they rarely had respiratory depression (4%). Among the hospitalized, pharmaceutical poisonings were most common (58%), 23% were comatose, and 7% had respiratory depression. Male patients comprised 69% of the pre-hospital discharges, but only 46% of the hospitalized patients. Except for one patient, who died of a new heroin overdose two days following discharge from an ambulance, there were no deaths during the first week after the poisonings in the 90% of the pre-hospital discharged patients with known identity. More than half of the poisoned patients treated in pre-hospital treatment settings were discharged without transfer to higher levels. These poisonings were more often caused by drug and alcohol abuse than in those who were hospitalized, and more than two-thirds were males. Almost half of those discharged from ambulances received an antidote. The pre-hospital treatment of these poisonings appears safe regarding short-term mortality.
0 An internal ribosome entry site element directs the synthesis of the 80 kDa isoforms of protein 4.1R. In red blood cells, protein 4.1 (4.1R) is an 80 kDa protein that stabilizes the spectrin-actin network and anchors it to the plasma membrane through its FERM domain. While the expression pattern of 4.1R in mature red cells is relatively simple, a rather complex array of 4.1R protein isoforms varying in N-terminal extensions, internal sequences and subcellular locations has been identified in nucleated cells. Among these, 135 kDa and 80 kDa isoforms have different N-terminal extensions and are expressed either from AUG1- or AUG2-containing mRNAs, respectively. These two types of mRNAs, varying solely by presence/absence of 17 nucleotides (nt) which contain the AUG1 codon, are produced by alternative splicing of the 4.1R pre-mRNA. It is unknown whether the 699 nt region comprised between AUG1 and AUG2, kept as a 5' untranslated region in AUG2-containing mRNAs, plays a role on 4.1R mRNA translation. By analyzing the in vitro expression of a panel of naturally occurring 4.1R cDNAs, we observed that all AUG1/AUG2-containing cDNAs gave rise to both long, 135 kDa, and short, 80 kDa, 4.1R isoforms. More importantly, similar results were also observed in cells transfected with this set of 4.1R cDNAs. Mutational studies indicated that the short isoforms were not proteolytic products of the long isoforms but products synthesized from AUG2. The presence of a cryptic promoter in the 4.1R cDNA sequence was also discounted. When a 583 nt sequence comprised between AUG1 and AUG2 was introduced into bicistronic vectors it directed protein expression from the second cistron. This was also the case when ribosome scanning was abolished by introduction of a stable hairpin at the 5' region of the first cistron. Deletion analysis of the 583 nt sequence indicated that nucleotides 170 to 368 are essential for expression of the second cistron. The polypyrimidine tract-binding protein bound to the 583 nt active sequence but not to an inactive 3'-fragment of 149 nucleotides. Our study is the first demonstration of an internal ribosome entry site as a mechanism ensuring the production of 80 kDa isoforms of protein 4.1R. This mechanism might also account for the generation of 60 kDa isoforms of 4.1R from a downstream AUG3. Our results reveal an additional level of control to 4.1R gene expression pathways and will contribute to the understanding of the biology of proteins 4.1R and their homologues, comprising an ample family of proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization.
3 Dengue reemergence in Argentina. Aedes aegypti, eradicated from Argentina in 1963, has now reinfested the country as far south as Buenos Aires. In 1997, four persons with travel histories to Brazil, Ecuador, or Venezuela had confirmed dengue, and surveillance for indigenous transmission allowed the detection of 19 dengue cases in Salta Province. These cases of dengue are the first in Argentina since 1916 and represent a new southern extension of dengue virus.
3 A randomized trial on effectiveness of artemether-lumefantrine versus artesunate plus amodiaquine for unsupervised treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Ghanaian children. Numerous trials have demonstrated high efficacy and safety of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) under supervised treatment. In contrast, effectiveness studies comparing different types of ACT applied unsupervised are scarce. The aim of this study was to compare effectiveness, tolerability and acceptance of artesunate plus amodiaquine (ASAQ) against that of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in Ghanaian children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. A randomized open-label trial was conducted at two district hospitals in the Ashanti region, Ghana, an area of intense malaria transmission. A total of 246 children under five years of age were randomly assigned to either ASAQ (Arsucam) or AL (Coartem). Study participants received their first weight-adjusted dose under supervision. After the parent/guardian was advised of times and mode of administration the respective three-day treatment course was completed unobserved at home. Follow-up visits were performed on days 3, 7, 14 and 28 to evaluate clinical and parasitological outcomes, adverse events, and haematological recovery. Length polymorphisms of variable regions of msp1 and msp2 were determined to differentiate recrudescences from reinfections. Acceptance levels of both treatment regimens were assessed by means of standardized interviews. Adequate clinical and parasitological responses after AL and ASAQ treatment were similar (88.3% and 91.7%, respectively). Interestingly, more late clinical failures until day 28 occurred in AL-treated children than in those who received ASAQ (17.5% and 7.3%, respectively; Hazard Ratio 2.41, 95% CI 1.00-5.79, p < 0.05).Haematological recovery and drug tolerability were not found to be significantly different in both study arms. The acceptance of treatment with ASAQ was higher than that with AL (rank-scores 10.6 and 10.3, respectively; p < 0.05). Unobserved AL and ASAQ treatment showed high adequate clinical and parasitological responses, though AL was inferior in preventing late clinical failures.
3 "A good personal scientific relationship": Philip Morris scientists and the Chulabhorn Research Institute, Bangkok. This paper examines the efforts of consultants affiliated with Philip Morris (PM), the world's leading transnational tobacco corporation, to influence scientific research and training in Thailand via the Chulabhorn Research Institute (CRI). A leading Southeast Asian institute for environmental health science, the CRI is headed by Professor Dr. Her Royal Highness Princess Chulabhorn, the daughter of the King of Thailand, and it has assumed international significance via its designation as a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre in December 2005. This paper analyses previously confidential tobacco industry documents that were made publicly available following litigation in the United States. PM documents reveal that ostensibly independent overseas scientists, now identified as industry consultants, were able to gain access to the Thai scientific community. Most significantly, PM scientist Roger Walk has established close connections with the CRI. Documents indicate that Walk was able to use such links to influence the study and teaching of environmental toxicology in the institute and to develop relations with key officials and local scientists so as to advance the interests of PM within Thailand and across Asia. While sensitivities surrounding royal patronage of the CRI make public criticism extremely difficult, indications of ongoing involvement by tobacco industry consultants suggest the need for detailed scrutiny of such relationships. The establishment of close links with the CRI advances industry strategies to influence scientific research and debate around tobacco and health, particularly regarding secondhand smoke, to link with academic institutions, and to build relationships with national elites. Such strategies assume particular significance in the national and regional contexts presented here amid the globalisation of the tobacco pandemic. From an international perspective, particular concern is raised by the CRI's recently awarded status as a WHO Collaborating Centre. Since the network of WHO Collaborating Centres rests on the principle of "using national institutions for international purposes," the documents presented below suggest that more rigorous safeguards are required to ensure that such use advances public health goals rather than the objectives of transnational corporations.
3 Metabolic syndrome and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in an Italian elderly population: the Progetto Veneto Anziani (Pro.V.A.) Study. The purpose of this study was to explore the association of metabolic syndrome and each of its components with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a general Italian elderly population. Metabolic syndrome, diagnosed by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality, was evaluated in 2,910 subjects aged > or =65 years of the Progetto Veneto Anziani (Pro.V.A.) Study during a mean follow-up time of 4.4 years. After multivariable adjustment, metabolic syndrome was associated with increased all-cause mortality in all subjects (hazard ratio 1.41 [95% CI 1.16-1.72], P = 0.001), among men (1.42 [1.06-1.89], P = 0.017), and among women (1.47 [1.13-1.91], P = 0.004). High glucose in all subjects (1.27 [1.02-1.59], P = 0.037) and in women (1.61 [1.16-2.24], P = 0.005) and low HDL cholesterol in women (1.48 [1.08-2.02], P = 0.014) were predictors of all-cause mortality, even independently of the interactions of different metabolic syndrome components. After multivariable adjustment, metabolic syndrome was also associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in all subjects (1.60 [1.17-2.19], P = 0.003), among men (1.66 [1.00-2.76], P = 0.051), and among women (1.60 [1.06-2.33], P = 0.025). High glucose (2.17 [1.28-3.68], P = 0.004) and low HDL cholesterol (1.78 [1.07-2.95], P = 0.026) among women predicted higher cardiovascular mortality. In this general Italian elderly population, among metabolic syndrome components, all-cause mortality is better predicted by high glucose in all subjects and in women and by low HDL cholesterol in women, whereas cardiovascular mortality is better predicted by high glucose and low HDL cholesterol in women.
1 Forest structure and roe deer abundance predict tick-borne encephalitis risk in Italy. The Western Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus often causes devastating or lethal disease. In Europe, the number of human TBE cases has increased dramatically over the last decade, risk areas are expanding and new foci are being discovered every year. The early localisation of new TBE foci and the identification of the main risk factors associated with disease emergence represent a priority for the public health community. Although a number of socio-economic parameters have been suggested to explain TBE upsurges in eastern Europe, the principal driving factors in relatively stable western European countries have not been identified. In this paper, we analyse the correlation between the upsurge of TBE in 17 alpine provinces in northern Italy from 1992 to 2006 with climatic variables, forest structure (as a proxy for small mammal reservoir host abundance), and abundance of the principal large vertebrate tick host (roe deer), using datasets available for the last 40 years. No significant differences between the pattern of changes in climatic variables in provinces where TBE has emerged compared to provinces were no clinical TBE cases have been observed to date. Instead, the best model for explaining the increase in TBE incidence in humans in this area include changes in forest structure, in particular the ratio of coppice to high stand forest, and the density of roe deer. Substantial changes in vegetation structure that improve habitat suitability for the main TBE reservoir hosts (small mammals), as well as an increase in roe deer abundance due to changes in land and wildlife management practices, are likely to be among the most crucial factors affecting the circulation potential of Western TBE virus and, consequently, the risk of TBE emergence in humans in western Europe. We believe our approach will be useful in predicting TBE risk on a wider scale.
1 The endovascular management of saccular posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms. The purpose of this retrospective study was to report the outcome of the endovascular treatment of eight patients with eight saccular posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms. Over the last seven years (1999-2006), eight consecutive patients with saccular PICA aneurysms were treated by endovascular methods. Five of the aneurysms were presented with subarachnoid hemorrhaging, whereas three were discovered incidentally. Four of the aneurysms (3 ruptured and 1 incidental) were treated by intrasaccular coiling, whereas the remaining four (1 ruptured and 3 incidental) were treated by vertebral artery (VA) occlusion. Of the four aneurysms treated by intrasaccular coiling, three were completely packed with coils and one was partially packed. In three of four patients who underwent vertebral artery occlusions, follow-up digital subtraction angiographies demonstrated thrombosed aneurysms and PICA. No procedure-related morbidity occurred and no re-bleed was encountered during a follow-up examination (mean; 31 months). As a result of this study, we found that the endovascular management of saccular PICA aneurysms should be considered as safe and effective.
3 Sequences from first settlers reveal rapid evolution in Icelandic mtDNA pool. A major task in human genetics is to understand the nature of the evolutionary processes that have shaped the gene pools of contemporary populations. Ancient DNA studies have great potential to shed light on the evolution of populations because they provide the opportunity to sample from the same population at different points in time. Here, we show that a sample of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences from 68 early medieval Icelandic skeletal remains is more closely related to sequences from contemporary inhabitants of Scotland, Ireland, and Scandinavia than to those from the modern Icelandic population. Due to a faster rate of genetic drift in the Icelandic mtDNA pool during the last 1,100 years, the sequences carried by the first settlers were better preserved in their ancestral gene pools than among their descendants in Iceland. These results demonstrate the inferential power gained in ancient DNA studies through the application of population genetics analyses to relatively large samples.
2 Hemolysis and hyperhomocysteinemia caused by cobalamin deficiency: three case reports and review of the literature. Concurrent hemolysis in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency is a well-recognized phenomenon and has been attributed to intramedullary destruction of erythrocytes (ineffective erythropoiesis). Recent studies revealed that homocysteine increased the risk of hemolysis in vitamin B12 deficiency in vitro and there is a high frequency (30%) of vitamin B12 deficiency in asymptomatic patients with homozygous methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation, a known cause of hyperhomocysteinemia. Here we report three patients with MTHFR mutations and vitamin B12 deficiency presenting with hemolytic anemia and severely elevated homocysteine levels. Patients demonstrated complete resolution of hemolysis with simultaneous normalization of serum homocysteine levels after vitamin B12 treatments. We reviewed pertinent literature, and hypothesized that hemolytic anemia may be more prevalent in patients who have a coexisting MTHFR gene mutation and vitamin B12 deficiency possibly related to severely elevated homocysteine levels. The hemolysis in these cases occurred predominantly in peripheral blood likely due to the combined effects of structurally defective erythrocytes and homocysteine-induced endothelial damage with microangiopathy.
3 Calnexin is not essential for mammalian rod opsin biogenesis. Misfolding mutations in rod opsin are a major cause of the inherited blindness retinitis pigmentosa. Therefore, understanding the role of molecular chaperones in facilitating rod opsin biogenesis and the response to mutant rod opsin is important for retinal disease and fundamental retinal cell biology. A recent report has shown that Drosophila rhodopsin Rh1 requires calnexin (Cnx) for its maturation and correct localization to R1-6 rhabdomeres. In this report, we investigate the role of Cnx in the processing of wild-type and mutant mammalian rod opsin. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from control mice (WT) and mice that express a truncated dysfunctional version of Cnx (sCnx) were used to assess the role of Cnx in the biogenesis, maturation, degradation, and aggregation of mutant and wild-type rod opsin. The mutant P23H rod opsin was used as a prototypical class II misfolding mutant as it is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is either degraded by ER associated degradation (ERAD) or forms aggregates that coalesce to form intracellular inclusions. Wild-type rod opsin protein translocated normally to the plasma membrane in both cell lines. In contrast, P23H rod opsin was retained in the ER in both cell lines. The only difference observed in rod opsin processing between the WT and sCnx MEFs was a small increase in the incidence of P23H intracellular inclusions in the sCnx cells. This did not appear to be specific for rod opsin, however, as non-rod opsin-expressing sCnx cells also had an increased incidence of ubiquitylated inclusions. Our data show that, unlike Drosophila Rh1, mammalian rod opsin biogenesis does not appear to have an absolute requirement for Cnx. Other chaperones are likely to be more important for mammalian rod opsin biogenesis and quality control.
0 Augmented lung inflammation protects against influenza A pneumonia. Influenza pneumonia causes high mortality every year, and pandemic episodes kill millions of people. Influenza-related mortality has been variously ascribed to an ineffective host response that fails to limit viral replication, an excessive host inflammatory response that results in lung injury and impairment of gas exchange, or to bacterial superinfection. We sought to determine whether lung inflammation promoted or impaired host survival in influenza pneumonia. To distinguish among these possible causes of influenza-related death, we induced robust lung inflammation by exposing mice to an aerosolized bacterial lysate prior to challenge with live virus. The treatment induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 8- and 40-fold greater, respectively, than that caused by lethal influenza infection. Yet, this augmented inflammation was associated with striking resistance to host mortality (0% vs 90% survival, p = 0.0001) and reduced viral titers (p = 0.004). Bacterial superinfection of virus infected lungs was not observed. When mice were repeatedly exposed to the bacterial lysate, as would be clinically desirable during an influenza epidemic, there was no tachyphylaxis of the induced viral resistance. When the bacterial lysate was administered after the viral challenge, there was still some mortality benefit, and when ribavirin was added to the aerosolized bacterial lysate, host survival was synergistically improved (0% vs 93.3% survival, p<0.0001). Together, these data indicate that innate immune resistance to influenza can be effectively stimulated, and suggest that ineffective rather than excessive inflammation is the major cause of mortality in influenza pneumonia.
1 Correlation between high resolution dynamic MR features and prognostic factors in breast cancer. To correlate high resolution dynamic MR features with prognostic factors in breast cancer. One hundred and ninety-four women with invasive ductal carcinomas underwent dynamic MR imaging using T1-weighted three-dimensional fast low-angle shot (3D-FLASH) sequence within two weeks prior to surgery. Morphological and kinetic MR features were determined based on the breast imaging and reporting data system (BI-RADS) MR imaging lexicon. Histological specimens were analyzed for tumor size, axillary lymph node status, histological grade, expression of estrogen receptor (ER), expression of progesterone receptor (PR), and expression of p53, c-erbB-2, and Ki-67. Correlations between the MR features and prognostic factors were determined using the Pearson chi(2) test, linear-by-linear association, and logistic regression analysis. By multivariate analysis, a spiculated margin was a significant, independent predictor of a lower histological grade (p < 0.001), and lower expression of Ki-67 (p = 0.007). Rim enhancement was significant, independent predictor of a higher histological grade (p < 0.001), negative expression of ER (p = 0.001), negative expression of PR (p < 0.001) and a larger tumor size (p = 0.006). A washout curve may predict a higher level of Ki-67 (p = 0.05). Most of the parameters of the initial enhancement phase cannot predict the status of the prognostic factors. Only the enhancement ratio may predict a larger tumor size (p = 0.05). Of the BI-RADS-MR features, a spiculated margin may predict favorable prognosis, whereas rim enhancement or washout may predict unfavorable prognosis of breast cancer.
1 A set of microsatellite markers with long core repeat optimized for grape (Vitis spp.) genotyping. Individual fingerprinting based on molecular markers has become a popular tool for studies of population genetics and analysis of genetic diversity in germplasm collections, including the solution of synonymy/homonymy and analysis of paternity and kinship. Genetic profiling of individuals is nowadays based on SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) markers, which have a number of positive features that make them superior to any other molecular marker developed so far. In humans, SSRs with core repeats three to five nucleotides long are preferred because neighbour alleles are more easily separated and distinguished from each other; while in plants, SSRs with shorter repeats, namely two-nucleotides long, are still in use although they suffer lower separation of neighbour alleles and uncomfortable stuttering. New microsatellite markers, containing tri-, tetra-, and penta-nucleotide repeats, were selected from a total of 26,962 perfect microsatellites in the genome sequence of nearly homozogous grapevine PN40024, assembled from reads covering 8.4 X genome equivalents. Long nucleotide repeats were selected for fingerprinting, as previously done in many species including humans. The new grape SSR markers were tested for their reproducibility and information content in a panel of 48 grape cultivars. Allelic segregation was tested in progenies derived from two controlled crosses. A list of 38 markers with excellent quality of peaks, high power of discrimination, and uniform genome distribution (1-3 markers/chromosome), is proposed for grape genotyping. The reasons for exclusion are given for those that were discarded. The construction of marker-specific allelic ladders is also described, and their use is recommended to harmonise allelic calls and make the data obtained with different equipment and by different laboratories fully comparable.
3 Designing an international policy and legal framework for the control of emerging infectious diseases: first steps. As the pace of emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases quickens, the International Health Regulations, which have served as the legal and policy framework of epidemic control for 45 years, are being revised by the World Health Organization (WHO). In this article, we review the recent history, legal construction, and application of these regulations and related international treaty-based sanitary measures, especially the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and the history of applying the regulations in the maritime and aviation industries. This review indicates that revision efforts should address 1) the limited scope of disease syndromes (and reporters of these syndromes) now in the regulations and 2) the mismatch between multisectoral factors causing disease emergence and the single agency (WHO) administering the regulations. The revised regulations should expand the scope of reporting and simultaneously broaden international agency coordination.
1 Nanocrystal technology, drug delivery and clinical applications. Nanotechnology will affect our lives tremendously over the next decade in very different fields, including medicine and pharmacy. Transfer of materials into the nanodimension changes their physical properties which were used in pharmaceutics to develop a new innovative formulation principle for poorly soluble drugs: the drug nanocrystals. The drug nanocrystals do not belong to the future; the first products are already on the market. The industrially relevant production technologies, pearl milling and high pressure homogenization, are reviewed. The physics behind the drug nanocrystals and changes of their physical properties are discussed. The marketed products are presented and the special physical effects ofnanocrystals explained which are utilized in each market product. Examples of products in the development pipelines (clinical phases) are presented and the benefits for in vivo administration of drug nanocrystals are summarized in an overview.
1 Diffuse hepatic hemangiomatosis without extrahepatic involvement in an adult patient. We report an extremely rare case of a diffuse hepatic hemangiomatosis without extrahepatic involvement in an adult. The imaging findings of this tumor were similar to those of a hepatic hemangioma and included contrast enhancement with a centripetal filling pattern of the entire hepatic tumor on the delayed phase of a dynamic CT and inhomogeneous diffuse uptake of the entire tumor on blood-pool images obtained five hours later on a 99mTc-labeled red blood cell scan. Despite its rarity, diffuse hepatic hemangiomatosis can be suggested in adult patients with diffusely involved hepatic tumors showing the radiological findings of a hepatic hemangioma.

3 Varicones and growth cones: two neurite terminals in PC12 cells. The rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line is one of the traditional models for the study of neurite outgrowth and growth cone behavior. To clarify to what extent PC12 neurite terminals can be compared to neuronal growth cones, we have analyzed their morphology and protein distribution in fixed PC12 cells by immunocytochemistry. Our results show that that PC12 cells display a special kind of neurite terminal that includes a varicosity in close association with a growth cone. This hybrid terminal, or "varicone", is characterized by the expression of specific markers not typically present in neuronal growth cones. For example, we show that calpain-2 is a specific marker of varicones and can be detected even before the neurite develops. Our data also shows that a fraction of PC12 neurites end in regular growth cones, which we have compared to hippocampal neurites as a control. We also report the extraordinary incidence of varicones in the literature referred to as "growth cones". In summary, we provide evidence of two different kinds of neurite terminals in PC12 cells, including a PC12-specific terminal, which implies that care must be taken when using them as a model for neuronal growth cones or neurite outgrowth.
2 Femoral artery necrosis due to parenteral intravascular drug misuse: a case report and literature review. Accidental intra-arterial injection as a consequence of drug misuse has been described in both the upper and lower limbs. We present a case in which a drug abuser injected heroin into his femoral artery. This resulted in necrosis of the femoral artery requiring an autologous graft. A life threatening haemorrhage necessitated ligation of the common femoral artery. His limb survived.
3 Short insulin tolerance test can determine the effects of thiazolidinediones treatment in type 2 diabetes. The short insulin tolerance test is a simple and reliable method of estimating insulin sensitivity. This study was designed to compare the insulin sensitizing effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) on the degree of insulin resistance, determined by a short insulin tolerance test (Kitt) in type 2 diabetic patients. Eighty-three subjects (mean age = 57.87 +/- 10.78) with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled and received daily one dose of rosiglitazone (4 mg) or pioglitazone (15 mg). The mean follow-up duration was 25.39 +/- 9.66 months. We assessed insulin sensitivity using HOMA-IR and the short insulin tolerance test before and after TZDs treatment. When we compared patients' characteristics before and after TZDs treatment, the mean fasting glucose level was significantly decreased (183.27 +/- 55.04 to 137.35 +/- 36.42 mg/dL, p < 0.001) and the mean HbA1C level was significantly decreased (9.24 +/- 1.96 to 8.11 +/- 1.39%, p < 0.001). Also, Kitt values were significantly increased (2.03 +/- 1.14 to 2.67 +/- 0.97%/min, p = 0.003), whereas HOMA-IR was significantly decreased (2.98 +/- 0.68 to 1.04 +/- 0.24, p < 0.05). When classifying insulin resistance by Kitt values, insulin resistant subjects' values were increased (< 2.5%/min; 1.51 +/- 0.53%/min to 2.63 +/- 0.88, p < 0.001), whereas the values decreased in insulin sensitive subjects (>or= 2.5%/min; 3.50 +/- 0.75%/min to 2.75 +/- 1.12%/min, p = 0.002). The glucose lowering effects of TZDs by improving insulin resistance could be determined by using Kitt. However, Kitt may be a beneficial tool to determine TZDs' effects only when patients' Kitt values are less than 2.5%/min.
3 Lamivudine therapy for korean children with chronic hepatitis B. Lamivudine is known to be very effective in suppressing hepatitis B virus replication and virus induced necroinflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate lamivudine therapy efficacy, predictive factors, breakthrough, prevalence of YMDD mutation, and relapse rate in Korean children with chronic hepatitis B. Between August 1999 and February 2005, 60 children on lamivudine therapy for chronic hepatitis B were enrolled. Treatment response was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization, and HBeAg and HBV-DNA disappearance. Seroconversion rates of HBeAg and HBV- DNA were 42% and 53%, respectively, and ALT normalization rate was 88%. Seroconversion rates of HBeAg (60.0%) and anti-HBe (60.0%) were higher in patients younger than 6 years. Seroconversion rate of HBV-DNA (68.4%) and normalization rate of serum ALT (94.7%) were highest in patients between 6 and 12 years. Seroconversion rates of all HBV markers were lowest in patients older than 12 years. Predicted 3 year cumulative seroconversion rates, were 70%, 68% for HBeAg, HBV-DNA, respectively. These were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression model showed that pre-treatment ALT was a positive predictive factor for seroconversion of HBeAg and HBV-DNA. Breakthrough phenomenon was noted in 6 patients, and 3 had a YMDD mutation. Lamivudine therapy had a significant effect on HBeAg seroconversion and HBV-DNA disappearance, and ALT normalization for Korean children with chronic hepatitis B.
0 Genome-wide linkage scan in Gullah-speaking African American families with type 2 diabetes: the Sea Islands Genetic African American Registry (Project SuGAR). The Gullah-speaking African American population from the Sea Islands of South Carolina is characterized by a low degree of European admixture and high rates of type 2 diabetes and diabetic complications. Affected relative pairs with type 2 diabetes were recruited through the Sea Islands Genetic African American Registry (Project SuGAR). We conducted a genome-wide linkage scan, genotyping 5,974 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 471 affected subjects and 50 unaffected relatives from 197 pedigrees. Data were analyzed using a multipoint engine for rapid likelihood inference and ordered subsets analyses (OSAs) for age at type 2 diabetes diagnosis, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and BMI. We searched for heterogeneity and interactions using a conditional logistic regression likelihood approach. Linkage peaks on chromosome 14 at 123-124 cM were detected for type 2 diabetes (logarithm of odds [LOD] 2.10) and for the subset with later age at type 2 diabetes diagnosis (maximum LOD 4.05). Two linkage peaks on chromosome 7 were detected at 44-45 cM for type 2 diabetes (LOD 1.18) and at 78 cM for type 2 diabetes (LOD 1.64) and the subset with earlier age at type 2 diabetes diagnosis (maximum LOD 3.93). The chromosome 14 locus and a peak on 7p at 29.5 cM were identified as important in the multilocus model. Other regions that provided modest evidence for linkage included chromosome 1 at 167.5 cM (LOD 1.51) and chromosome 3 at 121.0 cM (LOD 1.61). This study revealed a novel type 2 diabetes locus in an African American population on 14q that appears to reduce age of disease onset and confirmed two loci on chromosome 7.
2 Intratracheal administration of endotoxin attenuates hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of intratracheal administration of endotoxin on hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats. Newborn Sprague Dawley rat pups were divided into four experimental groups: normoxia control (NC), normoxia with endotoxin treatment (NE), hyperoxia control (HC), and hyperoxia with endotoxin treatment (HE) groups. In HC and HE, rat pups were subjected to 14 days of hyperoxia (> 95% oxygen) within 12 hours after birth. In endotoxin treated group (NE and HE), Escherichia coli endotoxin (0.5microg in 0.03mL of saline) was given intratracheally at the 1st, 3rd and 5th postnatal day. Radial alveolar count (RAC), mean linear intercept (MLI), RAC/MLI ratios, and degree of fibrosis were measured to assess the changes in lung morphology. During the research period, survival rates in both HC and HE were notably reduced 7 days after endotoxin was administered, but body weight gain was considerably reduced only in HC. On day 14, significant arrest in alveolarization, as evidenced by the decrease of RAC and RAC/MLI ratio and increase of MLI as well as increased fibrosis, were noted in HC. Although slight but significant arrest in alveolarization and increased fibrosis score were observed in NE compared to NC, the hyperoxia-induced lung damage observed in HC was significantly improved in HE. This study suggests that intratracheal administration of endotoxin significantly attenuated hyperoxia-induced lung injury in neonatal rats.
3 Erythema nodosum: clinicopathologic correlations and their use in differential diagnosis. Typically, a diagnosis of erythema nodosum (EN) is based on clinical features. However, other diseases manifest with inflammatory nodules of the lower limbs in addition to EN, such as the EN-like lesions of Behcet's disease (BD). The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the frequency of histologically proven EN among diseases diagnosed clinically as EN, to determine underlying causes of EN, and to compare clinical and histologic features between EN and other diseases. We selected 99 patients diagnosed clinically with EN and performed skin biopsies. All pathologic slides were evaluated and diagnosed; and after histologic diagnoses were made we reviewed the patients' medical records. Among the 99 patients diagnosed clinically with EN, 47 were biopsy-verified EN. The EN-like lesions of BD and nodular vasculitis were both in the primary differential diagnosis of EN. No definite difference in clinical features exists among these three diseases. Histologically, EN demonstrated septal panniculitis in the majority of patients. Lobular panniculitis was frequently observed in NV, and mixed or mostly lobular panniculitis was observed in the EN-like lesion. Vasculitis was rarely observed in EN; however lymphocytic vasculitis was observed frequently in EN-like lesions and neutrophilic vasculitis was observed in NV. The frequency of granulomatous inflammation was highest in NV. Some cases of patients with typical BD demonstrated classic EN lesions. It was extremely difficult to clinically differentiate EN from EN-like lesions or NV. We feel skin biopsy is mandatory for the diagnosis of lower extremity erythematous nodular lesions.
0 Bioinformatics enrichment tools: paths toward the comprehensive functional analysis of large gene lists. Functional analysis of large gene lists, derived in most cases from emerging high-throughput genomic, proteomic and bioinformatics scanning approaches, is still a challenging and daunting task. The gene-annotation enrichment analysis is a promising high-throughput strategy that increases the likelihood for investigators to identify biological processes most pertinent to their study. Approximately 68 bioinformatics enrichment tools that are currently available in the community are collected in this survey. Tools are uniquely categorized into three major classes, according to their underlying enrichment algorithms. The comprehensive collections, unique tool classifications and associated questions/issues will provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date view regarding the advantages, pitfalls and recent trends in a simpler tool-class level rather than by a tool-by-tool approach. Thus, the survey will help tool designers/developers and experienced end users understand the underlying algorithms and pertinent details of particular tool categories/tools, enabling them to make the best choices for their particular research interests.
1 Thoracic aortic aneurysm: reading the enemy's playbook. At the Yale University Center for Thoracic Aortic Disease, we have been using our clinical experience and laboratory investigations to shed light on the pathophysiology of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), the clinical behavior of thoracic aortic aneurysm, and the optimal clinical management. The Yale database contains information on 3,000 patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm, with 9,000 patient-years of follow-up and 9,000 imaging studies. Advanced statistical techniques were applied to this information. Analysis yielded the following Yale-generated observations: (1) TAA is a genetic disease with a predominantly autosomal dominant mode of inheritance; (2) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes are activated in the pathogenesis of TAA; (3) wall tension in TAA approaches the tensile limits of aortic tissue at a diameter of 6 cm; (4) by the time a TAA reaches a clinical diameter of 6 cm, 34 percent of affected patients have suffered dissection or rupture; (5) extreme physical exertion or severe emotion often precipitate acute dissection; and (6) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and RNA expression profile changes are being identified that predispose a patient to TAA and can serve as biomarkers for screening for this virulent disease. The "playbook" of TAA is gradually being read, with the help of scientific investigations, positioning practitioners to combat this lethal disease more effectively than ever before.
0 Role of macrolide therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The Global Burden of Disease study has concluded that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020, and will increase its ranking of disability-adjusted life years lost from 12th to 5th. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are associated with impaired quality of life and pulmonary function. More frequent or severe AECOPDs have been associated with especially markedly impaired quality of life and a greater longitudinal loss of pulmonary function. COPD and AECOPDs are characterized by an augmented inflammatory response. Macrolide antibiotics are macrocyclical lactones that provide adequate coverage for the most frequently identified pathogens in AECOPD and have been generally included in published guidelines for AECOPD management. In addition, they exert broad-ranging, immunomodulatory effects both in vitro and in vivo, as well as diverse actions that suppress microbial virulence factors. Macrolide antibiotics have been used to successfully treat a number of chronic, inflammatory lung disorders including diffuse panbronchiolitis, asthma, noncystic fibrosis associated bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. Data in COPD patients have been limited and contradictory but the majority hint to a potential clinical and biological effect. Additional, prospective, controlled data are required to define any potential treatment effect, the nature of this effect, and the role of bronchiectasis, baseline colonization, and other cormorbidities.
1 Health-related quality of life in patients with spinal cord injury: review of the short form 36-health questionnaire survey. Advances in medical and rehabilitative care have increased interest in studying how different factors may affect the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). There has been a large increase in the number of studies assessing HRQOL among persons with SCI. However, despite these advances, numerous issues remain unanswered because these studies have used a variety of methodologic approaches and assessment tools to examine how different factors have a role in predicting HRQOL in SCI populations. Therefore, standardized instruments should be used as part of this process. The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36) was developed in order to survey health status of the general population. However, the available data on the HRQOL of individuals with SCI are currently limited. In addition, there is little information currently available on the factors that are associated with HRQOL in the SCI population and this issue remains controversial. The findings from several individual studies that used the SF-36 to assess the HRQOL of patients suffering from SCI were reviewed, and the results were interpreted with disability in mind. This review article aims to summarize the data regarding the HRQOL of individuals with SCI by using the SF-36.
1 Determining gene expression on a single pair of microarrays. In microarray experiments the numbers of replicates are often limited due to factors such as cost, availability of sample or poor hybridization. There are currently few choices for the analysis of a pair of microarrays where N = 1 in each condition. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a new algorithm called PINC (PINC is Not Cyber-T) that can analyze Affymetrix microarray experiments. PINC treats each pair of probes within a probeset as an independent measure of gene expression using the Bayesian framework of the Cyber-T algorithm and then assigns a corrected p-value for each gene comparison.The p-values generated by PINC accurately control False Discovery rate on Affymetrix control data sets, but are small enough that family-wise error rates (such as the Holm's step down method) can be used as a conservative alternative to false discovery rate with little loss of sensitivity on control data sets. PINC outperforms previously published methods for determining differentially expressed genes when comparing Affymetrix microarrays with N = 1 in each condition. When applied to biological samples, PINC can be used to assess the degree of variability observed among biological replicates in addition to analyzing isolated pairs of microarrays.
1 Towards a Formative Assessment of Classroom Competencies (FACCs) for postgraduate medical trainees. An assumption of clinical competency is no longer acceptable or feasible in routine clinical practice. We sought to determine the feasibility, practicability and efficacy of undertaking a formal assessment of clinical competency for all postgraduate medical trainees in a large NHS foundation trust. FY1 doctors were asked to complete a questionnaire to determine prior experience and self reported confidence in performing the GMC core competencies. From this a consensus panel of key partners considered and developed an 8 station Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) circuit to assess clinical competencies in all training grade medical staff... The OSCE was then administered to all training grade doctors as part of their NHS trust induction process. 106 (87.6% of all trainees) participated in the assessment during the first 14 days of appointment. Candidates achieved high median raw percentage scores for the majority of stations however analysis of pre defined critical errors and omissions identified important areas for concern. Performance of newly qualified FY1 doctor was significantly better than other grades for the arterial blood gas estimation and nasogastric tube insertion stations. Delivering a formal classroom assessment of clinical competencies to all trainees as part of the induction process was both feasible and useful. The assessment identified areas of concern for future training and also served to reassure as to the proficiency of trainees in undertaking the majority of core competencies.
3 Surveillance of stool samples for the presence of Enterobacter sakazakii among Korean people. Enterobacter sakazakii (E. sakazakii) infections are an important cause of life-threatening meningitis, septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis in infants. Dried infant formula milk is an important vehicle for E. sakazakii infection. E. sakazakii was isolated in Korea from dried infant formula milk. Although E. sakazakii infection of infants may occur in Korea, its prevalence has not yet been documented. Therefore, we determined the prevalence of E. sakazakii and documented symptoms. Between March and October 2006, 1,146 stool samples were collected from patients at Uijeongbu St. Mary's Hospital. Each fecal swab was dissolved in 10mL of buffered peptone solution, and enriched culture was streaked onto Druggan-Forsythe-Iversen (DFI) agar. Presumptive E. sakazakii colonies that exhibited a blue-green color during culture on DFI medium were selected. The identity of colonies that developed yellow pigment during culture on TSA was determined using the Vitek system and PCR. We isolated 4 E. sakazakii strains whose 16S rRNA sequence alignments had a similarity of 99% with those of 3 E. sakazakii ATCC strains. This is the first report on isolation of E. sakazakii from stool samples and to document the symptoms of Korean patients.
0 Role of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Mitochondrial superoxide levels are elevated in the retina in diabetes, and manganese superoxide dismutase overexpression prevents the development of retinopathy. Superoxide inhibits glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which activates major pathways implicated in diabetic complications, including advanced glycation end products (AGEs), protein kinase C, and hexosamine pathway. Our aim is to investigate the role of GAPDH in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy and to elucidate the mechanism. Rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were in a state of poor control (GHb >11%) for 12 months, good control (GHb <7) soon after induction of diabetes, or poor control for 6 months with 6 months' good control. Retinal GAPDH, its ribosylation and nitration, AGEs, and PKC activation were determined and correlated with microvascular histopathology. In rats with poor control, retinal GAPDH activity and expressions were subnormal with increased ribosylation and nitration (25-30%). GAPDH activity was subnormal in both cytosol and nuclear fractions, but its protein expression and nitration were significantly elevated in nuclear fraction. Reinstitution of good control failed to protect inactivation of GAPDH, its covalent modification, and translocation to the nucleus. PKC, AGEs, and hexosamine pathways remained activated, and microvascular histopathology was unchanged. However, GAPDH and its translocation in good control rats were similar to those in normal rats. GAPDH plays a significant role in the development of diabetic retinopathy and its progression after cessation of hyperglycemia. Thus, therapies targeted toward preventing its inhibition may inhibit development of diabetic retinopathy and arrest its progression.
1 Clinical utility of genetic tests for inherited hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. Genetic testing has become an increasingly important part of medical practice for heritable form of cardiomyopathies. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and about 50% of idiopathic dilatative cardiomyopathy are familial diseases, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.Some genotype-phenotype correlations can provide important information to target DNA analyses in specific genes. Genetic testing may clarify diagnosis and help the optimal treatment strategies for more malignant phenotypes. In addition, genetic screening of first-degree relatives can help early identification and diagnosis of individuals at greatest risk for developing cardiomyopathy, allowing to focus clinical resources on high-risk family members.This paper provides a concise overview of the genetic etiology as well as the clinical utilities and limitations of genetic testing for the heritable cardiomyopathies.
3 Peripheral mononuclear cell resistin mRNA expression is increased in type 2 diabetic women. Resistin has been shown to cause insulin resistance and to impair glucose tolerance in rodents, but in humans its physiological role still remains elusive. The aim of this study was to examine whether resistin mRNA expression in human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and its corresponding plasma levels are altered in type 2 diabetes. Resistin mRNA levels were easily detectable in human PBMC, and found to be higher in DM2 compared to healthy women (P = .05). Similarly, mononuclear mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were all significantly higher in DM2 compared to control women (P < .001). The corresponding plasma resistin levels were slightly, but not significantly, increased in DM2 women (P = .051), and overall, they correlated significantly with BMI (r = 0.406, P = .010) and waist circumference (r = 0.516, P = .003), but not with fasting insulin levels or HOMA-IR. Resistin mRNA expression is increased in PBMC from DM2 women, together with increased expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, independent of obesity. These results suggest that resistin and cytokines might contribute to the low-grade inflammation and the increased atherogenic risk observed in these patients.
2 Tracking of neural stem cells in rats with intracerebral hemorrhage by the use of 3T MRI. To access the feasibility of clinically available 3T MRI to detect the migration of labeled neural stem cells (NSCs) in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in a rat model. The ethics committee of our institution approved this study. ICH was induced by the injection of collagenase type IV into the right striatum of ten Sprague-Dawley rats. Human NSCs conjugated with Feridex (super-paramagnetic iron oxide: SPIO) were transplanted into the left striatum one week after ICH induction. MRI was performed on a 3T scanner during the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth weeks post-transplantation. MRI was obtained using coronal T2- and T2*-weighted sequences. Two rats were sacrificed every week after in vivo MRI in order to analyze the histological findings. ICH in the right striatum was detected by MRI one and two weeks after transplantation without migration of the NSCs. There was no migration of the NSCs as seen on the histological findings one week after transplantation. The histological findings two weeks after transplantation showed a small number of NSCs along the corpus callosum. On MRI three weeks after transplantation, there was a hypointense line along the corpus callosum and decreased signal intensity in the right periventricular region. Histological findings three weeks after transplantation confirmed the presence of the hypointense line representing SPIO-labeled NSCs. MRI four and six weeks after transplantation showed a hypointense spot in the right periventricular region. The histological findings four and six weeks after transplantation showed the presence of prominent NSCs in the right periventricular region. 3T MRI can detect the migration of NSCs in rats with ICH along the corpus callosum. Therefore, 3T MRI could be feasible for detecting the migration of NSCs in the clinical setting of stem cell therapy.
0 Prevalence of pre-diabetes and its association with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors and hyperinsulinemia among U.S. adolescents: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are considered to constitute "pre-diabetes." We estimated the prevalence of IFG, IGT, and pre-diabetes among U.S. adolescents using data from a nationally representative sample. We analyzed data from participants aged 12-19 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006. We used fasting plasma glucose and 2-h glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test to assess the prevalence of IFG, IGT, and pre-diabetes and used the log-binomial model to estimate the prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs. The unadjusted prevalences of IFG, IGT, and pre-diabetes were 13.1, 3.4, and 16.1%, respectively. Boys had a 2.4-fold higher prevalence of pre-diabetes than girls (95% CI 1.3-4.3). Non-Hispanic blacks had a lower rate than non-Hispanic whites (PR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9). Adolescents aged 16-19 years had a lower rate than those aged 12-15 years (0.6, 0.4-0.9). Overweight adolescents had a 2.6-fold higher rate than those with normal weight (1.3-5.1). Adolescents with two or more cardiometabolic risk factors had a 2.7-fold higher rate than those with none (1.5-4.8). Adolescents with hyperinsulinemia had a fourfold higher prevalence (2.2-7.4) than those without. Neither overweight nor number of cardiometabolic risk factors was significantly associated with pre-diabetes after adjustment for hyperinsulinemia. Pre-diabetes was highly prevalent among adolescents. Hyperinsulinemia was independently associated with pre-diabetes and may account for the association of overweight and clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors with pre-diabetes.
1 The prince and the pauper. A tale of anticancer targeted agents. Cancer rates are set to increase at an alarming rate, from 10 million new cases globally in 2000 to 15 million in 2020. Regarding the pharmacological treatment of cancer, we currently are in the interphase of two treatment eras. The so-called pregenomic therapy which names the traditional cancer drugs, mainly cytotoxic drug types, and post-genomic era-type drugs referring to rationally-based designed. Although there are successful examples of this newer drug discovery approach, most target-specific agents only provide small gains in symptom control and/or survival, whereas others have consistently failed in the clinical testing. There is however, a characteristic shared by these agents: -their high cost-. This is expected as drug discovery and development is generally carried out within the commercial rather than the academic realm. Given the extraordinarily high therapeutic drug discovery-associated costs and risks, it is highly unlikely that any single public-sector research group will see a novel chemical "probe" become a "drug". An alternative drug development strategy is the exploitation of established drugs that have already been approved for treatment of non-cancerous diseases and whose cancer target has already been discovered. This strategy is also denominated drug repositioning, drug repurposing, or indication switch. Although traditionally development of these drugs was unlikely to be pursued by Big Pharma due to their limited commercial value, biopharmaceutical companies attempting to increase productivity at present are pursuing drug repositioning. More and more companies are scanning the existing pharmacopoeia for repositioning candidates, and the number of repositioning success stories is increasing. Here we provide noteworthy examples of known drugs whose potential anticancer activities have been highlighted, to encourage further research on these known drugs as a means to foster their translation into clinical trials utilizing the more limited public-sector resources. If these drug types eventually result in being effective, it follows that they could be much more affordable for patients with cancer; therefore, their contribution in terms of reducing cancer mortality at the global level would be greater.
3 Medicine 2.0: social networking, collaboration, participation, apomediation, and openness. In a very significant development for eHealth, broad adoption of Web 2.0 technologies and approaches coincides with the more recent emergence of Personal Health Application Platforms and Personally Controlled Health Records such as Google Health, Microsoft HealthVault, and Dossia.

0 Extended sequence typing of Campylobacter spp., United Kingdom. Supplementing Campylobacter spp. multilocus sequence typing with nucleotide sequence typing of 3 antigen genes increased the discriminatory index achieved from 0.975 to 0.992 among 620 clinical isolates from Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. This enhanced typing scheme enabled identification of clusters and retained data required for long-range epidemiologic comparisons of isolates.
3 The induction of antibody production by IL-6 is indirectly mediated by IL-21 produced by CD4+ T cells. Interleukin (IL) 6 is a proinflammtory cytokine produced by antigen-presenting cells and nonhematopoietic cells in response to external stimuli. It was initially identified as a B cell growth factor and inducer of plasma cell differentiation in vitro and plays an important role in antibody production and class switching in vivo. However, it is not clear whether IL-6 directly affects B cells or acts through other mechanisms. We show that IL-6 is sufficient and necessary to induce IL-21 production by naive and memory CD4(+) T cells upon T cell receptor stimulation. IL-21 production by CD4(+) T cells is required for IL-6 to promote B cell antibody production in vitro. Moreover, administration of IL-6 with inactive influenza virus enhances virus-specific antibody production, and importantly, this effect is dependent on IL-21. Thus, IL-6 promotes antibody production by promoting the B cell helper capabilities of CD4(+) T cells through increased IL-21 production. IL-6 could therefore be a potential coadjuvant to enhance humoral immunity.
0 Computational modeling of the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid switch reveals insights into cooperativity, priming, and irreversibility. Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.
3 Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis in an old-aged man. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (IRPF) is a rare disease characterized by a retroperitoneal inflammatory proliferative fibrosing process. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland; and is a frequently-occurring autoimmune disorder manifesting predominantly in middle-aged women. We report a rare association of IRPF with Hashimoto's thyroiditis in a 67-year-old man demonstrating good response to steroid therapy.
2 Transurethral resection of the prostate in Northern Nigeria, problems and prospects. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the commonest disease of the urinary tract afflicting the ageing male and is the commonest neoplastic disease in men aged 50 years and above. Transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) is the ultimate treatment of choice for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) due mainly to the preference of minimally invasive surgery, long term relief of symptoms and cost effectiveness. It is however not available to the majority of Nigerians in need of prostatic surgery in Public Health Institutions. The records of patients who underwent prostatectomy in Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, over the period June 2001 to July 2007 were examined. The bio data of patients and laboratory investigations performed were retrieved. Five Hundred and forty two patients were operated upon, out of which 40 were excluded due to open prostatectomy (22 patients), bladder neck stenosis (16 patients) or bladder tumour around the trigon (2 patients). The age range of the patients was 47-110 years with a mean of 67.2 years. 289 patients (80.1%) had urethral catheter in situ at presentation and 11 (3%) patients had suprapubic cystostomy of which only 3 (0.85%) had combined urethral stricture and BPH. Only 131 (26%) had their PSA measured which ranged from 2-100 ng/ml out of which 39(29.8% n = 131) patients had more than 4 ng/ml and cancer of the prostate and 1(0.8%, n = 131) patient had a PSA level of 4 ng/ml and malignant prostate. Hospital stay was 1-32 days (mean 7.9) and the mean follow up period was 5.6 months (range 0-60) and there were 17.5% complications comprising of urinary tract infection (UTI) 7.2%, Orchitis 2.2%, urinary incontinence 0.6%, atonic bladder 1%, erectile dysfunction 0.6%, cerebrovascular accident 0.4%, myocardial infarction 0.4%, deep vein thrombosis 0.4% and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) 0.6% and 1.2% mortality. The cost of treatment inclusive of pre-admission investigations was US$ 615.00 (range US$ 300-1,300) Despite advances in minimally invasive therapy for LUTH/BPH, TURP is the optimum treatment of choice for the ageing male of sub-Saharan Africa. It is however not available to the majority of patients in this region due to poor health allocation and inadequate facilities and training.
1 Sonographically-guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy for papillary lesions of the breast. We wanted to assess the need for surgical excising papillary lesions of the breast that were diagnosed upon sonographically guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy. Sixty-nine women (age range: 25-74 years, mean age: 51.7 years) with 69 papillary lesions (4.9%) were diagnosed and followed after performing sonographically guided 14-gauge core needle biopsies. Surgical excision was performed for 44 (64%) of 69 papillary lesions, and 25 lesions were followed with imaging studies (range: 6-46 months, mean: 17.9 months). The histologic findings upon core biopsy were compared with the surgical, imaging and follow-up findings. Core needle biopsies of 69 lesions yielded tissue that was classified as benign for 43 lesions, atypical for 18 lesions and malignant for eight lesions. Of the 43 lesions that yielded benign papilloma upon core needle biopsy, one had intraductal papillary carcinoma found upon surgery. An immediate surgical biopsy was recommended for this lesion because of the imaging-histologic discordance. No additional carcinoma was found during the imaging follow-up. Surgical excision was performed for 17 atypical papillary lesions, and this revealed intraductal (n = 6) or invasive (n = 2) papillary carcinoma in 8 (47%) lesions. Of the seven intraductal papillary carcinomas, surgery revealed invasive papillary carcinoma in one (14%). Our results suggest that papillary lesions of the breast that are diagnosed as benign upon sonographically guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy can be followed when the results are concordant with the imaging findings.
1 Visceral leishmaniasis elimination programme in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal: reshaping the case finding/case management strategy. We sought to estimate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) burden in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal and document care-seeking behaviour for VL to provide baseline information for monitoring the VL elimination program and identify options for improved case finding and management. A cross-sectional study using cluster sampling (clusters being villages) of 4 VL endemic districts was used in order to document all current and existing VL cases over the preceding 12 mo. Extended (in-depth) interviews were conducted in a subsample of households to explore (a) VL-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the population; (b) use of VL care by patients; and (c) delay between onset of symptoms, diagnosis, and start of treatment, as well as treatment interruption. Findings were discussed with national program managers and policy makers to develop improved strategies. Screening for VL was done in 18,933 households (106,425 inhabitants). The estimated annual incidence of VL in the endemic districts was on average 22 times higher than the elimination target of less than one case per 10,000 inhabitants in 2015. This incidence varied widely between study sites, from 9.0 to 29.8 per 10,000 inhabitants. The percentage of newly detected cases through the household screening was high in the districts least covered by health-care services (particularly Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 49%; and to a lesser extent Vaishali in Bihar, India, 32.5%), and much lower in districts with greater availability of VL care (Muzaffarpur, India, 3.8%). On average 267 houses had to be visited, i.e., at least three to four working days per health worker, to identify a new VL (ranging from 1,432 houses in Muzaffarpur, India to only 166 houses in Rajshahi, Bangladesh). Knowledge of the disease and its vectors was good in India and Nepal but poor in Bangladesh (Rajshahi) where very little attention has been given to VL over the last decades. Although all socio-demographic indicators showed high levels of poverty, people in India preferred private medical practitioners for the treatment of VL, whereas in Nepal, and even more in Bangladesh, the public health-care sector was preferred. Delays between onset of symptoms and diagnosis as well as start of treatment was high. Reported non-adherence to treatment was particularly high in the more under-served districts and was mainly due to lack of resources. The findings suggest that (a) house-to-house screening may be useful in highly endemic districts with a poor passive case detection system, but further evidence on case finding adapted to local conditions has to be collected; (b) strengthening the quality of the public health sector is imperative in the three countries, especially in India, with its largely unregulated private-sector provision of VL care.
2 Successful catheter ablation of atrial tachycardia originating from the non-coronary aortic sinus. We report a rare case of atrial tachycardia originating from the non-coronary aortic sinus. After failed radiofrequency (RF) energy applications at right His-bundle region, the complete elimination of atrial tachycardia was achieved with an RF energy application in the non-coronary aortic sinus. With the review of other papers, this report emphasizes the importance of mapping in the non-coronary aortic sinus in focal atrial tachycardia near the atrioventricular node or near the His-bundle.
3 Glutathione provides a source of cysteine essential for intracellular multiplication of Francisella tularensis. Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium causing the zoonotic disease tularemia. Its ability to multiply and survive in macrophages is critical for its virulence. By screening a bank of HimarFT transposon mutants of the F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) to isolate intracellular growth-deficient mutants, we selected one mutant in a gene encoding a putative gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). This gene (FTL_0766) was hence designated ggt. The mutant strain showed impaired intracellular multiplication and was strongly attenuated for virulence in mice. Here we present evidence that the GGT activity of F. tularensis allows utilization of glutathione (GSH, gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) and gamma-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as cysteine sources to ensure intracellular growth. This is the first demonstration of the essential role of a nutrient acquisition system in the intracellular multiplication of F. tularensis. GSH is the most abundant source of cysteine in the host cytosol. Thus, the capacity this intracellular bacterial pathogen has evolved to utilize the available GSH, as a source of cysteine in the host cytosol, constitutes a paradigm of bacteria-host adaptation.
2 Access and interest: two important issues in considering the feasibility of web-assisted tobacco interventions. Previous research has found that current smokers are less likely to have access to the Internet than nonsmokers. As access to the Internet continues to expand, does this finding remain true? Also, how many smokers are interested in Web-assisted tobacco interventions (WATIs)? These questions are important to determine the potential role that WATIs might play in promoting tobacco cessation. The aims of the study were to determine whether smokers are less likely than nonsmokers to have access to the Internet and to establish the level of interest in WATIs among a representative sample of smokers. A random digit dialing telephone survey was conducted of 8467 adult respondents, 18 years and older, in Ontario, Canada from September 2006 to August 2007. All respondents were asked their smoking status and whether they used the Internet (at home or work in the past 12 months; where; how often in the past 12 months). To assess the level of interest in WATIs, current daily smokers were asked whether they would be interested in a confidential program that they could access on the Internet, free of charge, that would allow them to check their smoking and compare it to other Canadians. Smokers were marginally less likely to have used the Internet than nonsmokers (74% vs 81% in the last year), and, of those who had access to the Internet, smokers used the Internet less often than nonsmokers. Overall, 40% of smokers said they would be interested in a WATI. The number of cigarettes smoked per day was unrelated to level of interest in the WATI, but time to first cigarette after waking was. Smokers who used the Internet were more interested in the WATI than smokers who did not use the Internet (46% vs 20%). While the difference in level of Internet use between smokers and nonsmokers was greatly reduced compared to 2002 and 2004 data, smokers still remain marginally less likely to use the Internet than nonsmokers. Overall, there was a substantial level of interest in the WATI among smokers, in particular among smokers who currently use the Internet. These results indicate that WATIs have a substantial potential audience among smokers, and, given the growing body of evidence regarding their efficacy, there is growing support that WATIs have a significant role to play in promoting tobacco cessation.
0 From protein interactions to functional annotation: graph alignment in Herpes. Sequence alignment is a prolific basis of functional annotation, but remains a challenging problem in the 'twilight zone' of high sequence divergence or short gene length. Here we demonstrate how information on gene interactions can help to resolve ambiguous sequence alignments. We compare two distant Herpes viruses by constructing a graph alignment, which is based jointly on the similarity of their protein interaction networks and on sequence similarity. This hybrid method provides functional associations between proteins of the two organisms that cannot be obtained from sequence or interaction data alone. We find proteins where interaction similarity and sequence similarity are individually weak, but together provide significant evidence of orthology. There are also proteins with high interaction similarity but without any detectable sequence similarity, providing evidence of functional association beyond sequence homology. The functional predictions derived from our alignment are consistent with genomic position and gene expression data. Our approach shows that evolutionary conservation is a powerful filter to make protein interaction data informative about functional similarities between the interacting proteins, and it establishes graph alignment as a powerful tool for the comparative analysis of data from highly diverged species.
1 Additive effects of PDGF receptor beta signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle cell development. The platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor (PDGFRbeta) is known to activate many molecules involved in signal transduction and has been a paradigm for receptor tyrosine kinase signaling for many years. We have sought to determine the role of individual signaling components downstream of this receptor in vivo by analyzing an allelic series of tyrosine-phenylalanine mutations that prevent binding of specific signal transduction components. Here we show that the incidence of vascular smooth muscle cells/pericytes (v/p), a PDGFRbeta-dependent cell type, can be correlated to the amount of receptor expressed and the number of activated signal transduction pathways. A decrease in either receptor expression levels or disruption of multiple downstream signaling pathways lead to a significant reduction in v/p. Conversely, loss of RasGAP binding leads to an increase in this same cell population, implicating a potential role for this effector in attenuating the PDGFRbeta signal. The combined in vivo and biochemical data suggest that the summation of pathways associated with the PDGFRbeta signal transduction determines the expansion of developing v/p cells.
3 Rates of new-onset psoriasis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha therapy: results from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register. Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha treatments improve outcome in severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and are efficacious in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. However recent case reports describe psoriasis occurring as an adverse event in patients with RA receiving anti-TNFalpha therapy. We aimed to determine whether the incidence rate of psoriasis was higher in patients with RA treated with anti-TNFalpha therapy compared to those treated with traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). We also compared the incidence rates of psoriasis between the three anti-TNFalpha drugs licensed for RA. We studied 9826 anti-TNF-treated and 2880 DMARD-treated patients with severe RA from The British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register (BSRBR). All patients reported with new onset psoriasis as an adverse event were included in the analysis. Incidence rates of psoriasis were calculated as events/1000 person years and compared using incidence rate ratios (IRR). In all, 25 incident cases of psoriasis in patients receiving anti-TNFalpha therapy and none in the comparison cohort were reported between January 2001 and July 2007. The absence of any cases in the comparison cohort precluded a direct comparison; however the crude incidence rate of psoriasis in those treated with anti-TNFalpha therapy was elevated at 1.04 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.54) per 1000 person years compared to the rate of 0 (upper 97.5% CI 0.71) per 1000 person years in the patients treated with DMARDs. Patients treated with adalimumab had a significantly higher rate of incident psoriasis compared to patients treated with etanercept (IRR 4.6, 95% CI 1.7 to 12.1) and infliximab (IRR 3.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 9.3). Results from this study suggest that the incidence of psoriasis is increased in patients treated with anti-TNFalpha therapy. Our findings also suggest that the incidence may be higher in patients treated with adalimumab.
2 Immune control of an SIV challenge by a T-cell-based vaccine in rhesus monkeys. A recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vector-based vaccine for HIV-1 has recently failed in a phase 2b efficacy study in humans. Consistent with these results, preclinical studies have demonstrated that rAd5 vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag failed to reduce peak or setpoint viral loads after SIV challenge of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that lacked the protective MHC class I allele Mamu-A*01 (ref. 3). Here we show that an improved T-cell-based vaccine regimen using two serologically distinct adenovirus vectors afforded substantially improved protective efficacy in this challenge model. In particular, a heterologous rAd26 prime/rAd5 boost vaccine regimen expressing SIV Gag elicited cellular immune responses with augmented magnitude, breadth and polyfunctionality as compared with the homologous rAd5 regimen. After SIV(MAC251) challenge, monkeys vaccinated with the rAd26/rAd5 regimen showed a 1.4 log reduction of peak and a 2.4 log reduction of setpoint viral loads as well as decreased AIDS-related mortality as compared with control animals. These data demonstrate that durable partial immune control of a pathogenic SIV challenge for more than 500 days can be achieved by a T-cell-based vaccine in Mamu-A*01-negative rhesus monkeys in the absence of a homologous Env antigen. These findings have important implications for the development of next-generation T-cell-based vaccine candidates for HIV-1.
0 Septic shock due to Vibrio alginolyticus in a cirrhotic patient: the first case in Korea. We describe a case of septic shock due to Vibrio alginolyticus presenting with fever and bilateral leg pain. Despite intensive management with antibiotics and inotropic agents, the patient died from septic shock 1 day after hospitalization. V. alginolyticus was isolated from both leg wounds and a blood culture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of V. alginolyticus bacteremia in Korea.
0 Genetic polymorphisms of RANTES, IL1-A, MCP-1 and TNF-A genes in patients with prostate cancer. Inflammation has been implicated as an etiological factor in several human cancers, including prostate cancer. Allelic variants of the genes involved in inflammatory pathways are logical candidates as genetic determinants of prostate cancer risk. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes that lead to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are associated with an increased prostate cancer risk. A case-control study design was used to test the association between prostate cancer risk and the polymorphisms TNF-A-308 A/G (rs 1800629), RANTES-403 G/A (rs 2107538), IL1-A-889 C/T (rs 1800587) and MCP-1 2518 G/A (rs 1024611) in 296 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and in 311 healthy controls from the same area. Diagnosis of prostate cancer was significantly associated with TNF-A GA + AA genotype (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.09-2.64) and RANTES GA + AA genotype (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.09-2.38). A alleles in TNF-A and RANTES influenced prostate cancer susceptibility and acted independently of each other in these subjects. No epistatic effect was found for the combination of different polymorphisms studied. Finally, no overall association was found between prostate cancer risk and IL1-A or MCP-1 polymorphisms. Our results and previously published findings on genes associated with innate immunity support the hypothesis that polymorphisms in proinflammatory genes may be important in prostate cancer development.
0 Characterization of the differentially methylated region of the Impact gene that exhibits Glires-specific imprinting. Imprinted genes are exclusively expressed from one of the two parental alleles in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. In mammals, nearly 100 genes are documented to be imprinted. To understand the mechanism behind this gene regulation and to identify novel imprinted genes, common features of DNA sequences have been analyzed; however, the general features required for genomic imprinting have not yet been identified, possibly due to variability in underlying molecular mechanisms from locus to locus. We performed a thorough comparative genomic analysis of a single locus, Impact, which is imprinted only in Glires (rodents and lagomorphs). The fact that Glires and primates diverged from each other as recent as 70 million years ago makes comparisons between imprinted and non-imprinted orthologues relatively reliable. In species from the Glires clade, Impact bears a differentially methylated region, whereby the maternal allele is hypermethylated. Analysis of this region demonstrated that imprinting was not associated with the presence of direct tandem repeats nor with CpG dinucleotide density. In contrast, a CpG periodicity of 8 bp was observed in this region in species of the Glires clade compared to those of carnivores, artiodactyls, and primates. We show that tandem repeats are dispensable, establishment of the differentially methylated region does not rely on G+C content and CpG density, and the CpG periodicity of 8 bp is meaningful to the imprinting. This interval has recently been reported to be optimal for de novo methylation by the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3L complex, suggesting its importance in the establishment of imprinting in Impact and other genes.
0 Organised genome dynamics in the Escherichia coli species results in highly diverse adaptive paths. The Escherichia coli species represents one of the best-studied model organisms, but also encompasses a variety of commensal and pathogenic strains that diversify by high rates of genetic change. We uniformly (re-) annotated the genomes of 20 commensal and pathogenic E. coli strains and one strain of E. fergusonii (the closest E. coli related species), including seven that we sequenced to completion. Within the approximately 18,000 families of orthologous genes, we found approximately 2,000 common to all strains. Although recombination rates are much higher than mutation rates, we show, both theoretically and using phylogenetic inference, that this does not obscure the phylogenetic signal, which places the B2 phylogenetic group and one group D strain at the basal position. Based on this phylogeny, we inferred past evolutionary events of gain and loss of genes, identifying functional classes under opposite selection pressures. We found an important adaptive role for metabolism diversification within group B2 and Shigella strains, but identified few or no extraintestinal virulence-specific genes, which could render difficult the development of a vaccine against extraintestinal infections. Genome flux in E. coli is confined to a small number of conserved positions in the chromosome, which most often are not associated with integrases or tRNA genes. Core genes flanking some of these regions show higher rates of recombination, suggesting that a gene, once acquired by a strain, spreads within the species by homologous recombination at the flanking genes. Finally, the genome's long-scale structure of recombination indicates lower recombination rates, but not higher mutation rates, at the terminus of replication. The ensuing effect of background selection and biased gene conversion may thus explain why this region is A+T-rich and shows high sequence divergence but low sequence polymorphism. Overall, despite a very high gene flow, genes co-exist in an organised genome.
2 Thrombosuction utilizing an export aspiration catheter during primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute myocardial infarction. Effective myocardial reperfusion after primary PCI for an AMI in lesions with a thrombus is limited by distal embolization and the slow/no reflow phenomenon. We evaluated the efficacy of a thrombus reduction technique using an export aspiration catheter for thrombosuction during primary PCI. We analyzed 62 patients with AMIs who underwent primary PCI and had a thrombi burden during thrombosuction using an EAC (EAC group; n=31) or without thrombosuction (control group; n=31). Thrombosuction with an EAC was performed safely in all the patients in EAC group without any complications. After the PCI, restoration to a TIMI flow grade 3 was significantly more frequent in the EAC group (26/31 vs. 20/31, p < 0.05). However, the TIMI perfusion grade did not differ between the two groups. Further, the corrected TIMI frame counts were lower in the EAC group (23.9 +/- 15.1 vs. 34.8 +/- 22.5, p < 0.05). Although there was no statistical significance, a greater incidence of distal embolization was observed in the control group (16.1%, 5/31) as compared to the EAC group (0/31) (p= 0.056). However, the incidence of major adverse cardiac events at 1 and 6 months did not differ between the two groups. For AMIs, thrombosuction with an EAC before or during PCI is a safe and potentially effective method for restoration of the coronary flow.
1 Spatial dependency of V. cholera prevalence on open space refuse dumps in Kumasi, Ghana: a spatial statistical modelling. Cholera has persisted in Ghana since its introduction in the early 70's. From 1999 to 2005, the Ghana Ministry of Health officially reported a total of 26,924 cases and 620 deaths to the WHO. Etiological studies suggest that the natural habitat of V. cholera is the aquatic environment. Its ability to survive within and outside the aquatic environment makes cholera a complex health problem to manage. Once the disease is introduced in a population, several environmental factors may lead to prolonged transmission and secondary cases. An important environmental factor that predisposes individuals to cholera infection is sanitation. In this study, we exploit the importance of two main spatial measures of sanitation in cholera transmission in an urban city, Kumasi. These are proximity and density of refuse dumps within a community. A spatial statistical modelling carried out to determine the spatial dependency of cholera prevalence on refuse dumps show that, there is a direct spatial relationship between cholera prevalence and density of refuse dumps, and an inverse spatial relationship between cholera prevalence and distance to refuse dumps. A spatial scan statistics also identified four significant spatial clusters of cholera; a primary cluster with greater than expected cholera prevalence, and three secondary clusters with lower than expected cholera prevalence. A GIS based buffer analysis also showed that the minimum distance within which refuse dumps should not be sited within community centres is 500 m. The results suggest that proximity and density of open space refuse dumps play a contributory role in cholera infection in Kumasi.
3 Human polycomb 2 protein is a SUMO E3 ligase and alleviates substrate-induced inhibition of cystathionine beta-synthase sumoylation. Human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the first irreversible step in the transsulfuration pathway and commits homocysteine to the synthesis of cysteine. Mutations in CBS are the most common cause of severe hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia. A yeast two-hybrid approach to screen for proteins that interact with CBS had previously identified several components of the sumoylation pathway and resulted in the demonstration that CBS is a substrate for sumoylation. In this study, we demonstrate that sumoylation of CBS is enhanced in the presence of human polycomb group protein 2 (hPc2), an interacting partner that was identified in the initial yeast two-hybrid screen. When the substrates for CBS, homocysteine and serine for cystathionine generation and homocysteine and cysteine for H(2)S generation, are added to the sumoylation mixture, they inhibit the sumoylation reaction, but only in the absence of hPc2. Similarly, the product of the CBS reaction, cystathionine, inhibits sumoylation in the absence of hPc2. Sumoylation in turn decreases CBS activity by approximately 28% in the absence of hPc2 and by 70% in its presence. Based on these results, we conclude that hPc2 serves as a SUMO E3 ligase for CBS, increasing the efficiency of sumoylation. We also demonstrate that gamma-cystathionase, the second enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway is a substrate for sumoylation under in vitro conditions. We speculate that the role of this modification may be for nuclear localization of the cysteine-generating pathway under conditions where nuclear glutathione demand is high.
0 Streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome: spectrum of disease, pathogenesis, and new concepts in treatment. Since the 1980s there has been a marked increase in the recognition and reporting of highly invasive group A streptococcal infections with or without necrotizing fasciitis associated with shock and organ failure. Such dramatic cases have been defined as streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome. Strains of group A streptococci isolated from patients with invasive disease have been predominantly M types 1 and 3 that produce pyrogenic exotoxin A or B or both. In this paper, the clinical and demographic features of streptococcal bacteremia, myositis, and necrotizing fasciitis are presented and compared to those of streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome. Current concepts in the pathogenesis of invasive streptococcal infection are also presented, with emphasis on the interaction between group A Streptococcus virulence factors and host defense mechanisms. Finally, new concepts in the treatment of streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome are discussed.
1 Fr-TM-align: a new protein structural alignment method based on fragment alignments and the TM-score. Protein tertiary structure comparisons are employed in various fields of contemporary structural biology. Most structure comparison methods involve generation of an initial seed alignment, which is extended and/or refined to provide the best structural superposition between a pair of protein structures as assessed by a structure comparison metric. One such metric, the TM-score, was recently introduced to provide a combined structure quality measure of the coordinate root mean square deviation between a pair of structures and coverage. Using the TM-score, the TM-align structure alignment algorithm was developed that was often found to have better accuracy and coverage than the most commonly used structural alignment programs; however, there were a number of situations when this was not true. To further improve structure alignment quality, the Fr-TM-align algorithm has been developed where aligned fragment pairs are used to generate the initial seed alignments that are then refined using dynamic programming to maximize the TM-score. For the assessment of the structural alignment quality from Fr-TM-align in comparison to other programs such as CE and TM-align, we examined various alignment quality assessment scores such as PSI and TM-score. The assessment showed that the structural alignment quality from Fr-TM-align is better in comparison to both CE and TM-align. On average, the structural alignments generated using Fr-TM-align have a higher TM-score (~9%) and coverage (~7%) in comparison to those generated by TM-align. Fr-TM-align uses an exhaustive procedure to generate initial seed alignments. Hence, the algorithm is computationally more expensive than TM-align. Fr-TM-align, a new algorithm that employs fragment alignment and assembly provides better structural alignments in comparison to TM-align. The source code and executables of Fr-TM-align are freely downloadable at: http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/skolnick/files/FrTMalign/.
3 The effects of socioeconomic status and indices of physical environment on reduced birth weight and preterm births in Eastern Massachusetts. Air pollution and social characteristics have been shown to affect indicators of health. While use of spatial methods to estimate exposure to air pollution has increased the power to detect effects, questions have been raised about potential for confounding by social factors. A study of singleton births in Eastern Massachusetts was conducted between 1996 and 2002 to examine the association between indicators of traffic, land use, individual and area-based socioeconomic measures (SEM), and birth outcomes (birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm births), in a two-level hierarchical model. We found effects of both individual (education, race, prenatal care index) and area-based (median household income) SEM with all birth outcomes. The associations for traffic and land use variables were mainly seen with birth weight, with an exception for an effect of cumulative traffic density on small for gestational age. Race/ethnicity of mother was an important predictor of birth outcomes and a strong confounder for both area-based SEM and indices of physical environment. The effects of traffic and land use differed by level of education and median household income. Overall, the findings of the study suggested greater likelihood of reduced birth weight and preterm births among the more socially disadvantaged, and a greater risk of reduced birth weight associated with traffic exposures. Results revealed the importance of controlling simultaneously for SEM and environmental exposures as the way to better understand determinants of health.
2 Host factors do not influence the colonization or infection by fluconazole resistant Candida species in hospitalized patients. Nosocomial yeast infections have significantly increased during the past two decades in industrialized countries, including Taiwan. This has been associated with the emergence of resistance to fluconazole and other antifungal drugs. The medical records of 88 patients, colonized or infected with Candida species, from nine of the 22 hospitals that provided clinical isolates to the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts (TSARY) program in 1999 were reviewed. A total of 35 patients contributed fluconazole resistant strains [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) > or = 64 mg/l], while the remaining 53 patients contributed susceptible ones (MICs < or = 8 mg/l). Fluconazole resistance was more frequent among isolates of Candida tropicalis (46.5%) than either C. albicans (36.8%) or C. glabrata (30.8%). There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics or underlying diseases among patients contributing strains different in drug susceptibility.
1 Accuracy of a high prostate-specific antigen level for prostate cancer diagnosis upon initial biopsy in Korean men. This study aimed to evaluate the cancer detection rate in a Korean population with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels greater than or equal to 20.0 ng/mL. A total of 174 men 50 to 79 years old (median 69) included in the study. The median prostate volume of the patients was 44.8 mL (range 14.1 to 210.0) and their serum PSA ranged from 20.0 to 9725.0 ng/mL (median 44.8). Of 174 men 141 (81.0%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer on initial biopsy. In the total number of patients, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 62.9% for PSA 20 to 29.9, 72.7% for PSA 30 to 39.9 and 100% for PSA 40 to 49.9 ng/mL. In patients with an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE), the values for these PSA ranges increased to 89.5%, 91.7% and 100%, respectively. The PPV was 81.0% for PSA cutoff of 20, 89.2% for a cutoff of 30, 95.4% for a cutoff of 40, and 94.7% for a cutoff of 50 ng/mL. In conjunction with an abnormal DRE, the values for these PSA cutoffs increased to 95.9%, 98.1%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Our data suggest the ability to predict the presence of prostate cancer reliably on initial biopsy when PSA threshold is greater than or equal to 50 ng/mL. This PSA threshold may be lowered to 40 ng/mL in the presence of an abnormal DRE. In Korean men with high PSA, the detection rate of prostate cancer on biopsy appears to be comparable to that for American men.
1 Diagnostic accuracy of NS1 ELISA and lateral flow rapid tests for dengue sensitivity, specificity and relationship to viraemia and antibody responses. Dengue is a public health problem in many countries. Rapid diagnosis of dengue can assist patient triage and management. Detection of the dengue viral protein, NS1, represents a new approach to dengue diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity of the Platelia NS1 ELISA assay and an NS1 lateral flow rapid test (LFRT) were compared against a gold standard reference diagnostic algorithm in 138 Vietnamese children and adults. Overall, the Platelia NS1 ELISA was modestly more sensitive (82%) than the NS1 LFRT (72%) in confirmed dengue cases. Both ELISA and LFRT assays were more sensitive for primary than secondary dengue, and for specimens collected within 3 days of illness onset relative to later time points. The presence of measurable DENV-reactive IgG and to a lesser extent IgM in the test sample was associated with a significantly lower rate of NS1 detection in both assays. NS1 positivity was associated with the underlying viraemia, as NS1-positive samples had a significantly higher viraemia than NS1-negative samples matched for duration of illness. The Platelia and NS1 LFRT were 100% specific, being negative in all febrile patients without evidence of recent dengue, as well as in patients with enteric fever, malaria, Japanese encephalitis and leptospirosis. Collectively, these data suggest NS1 assays deserve inclusion in the diagnostic evaluation of dengue patients, but with due consideration for the limitations in patients who present late in their illness or have a concomitant humoral immune response.
3 Human herpesvirus-6 induces MVB formation, and virus egress occurs by an exosomal release pathway. The final envelopment of most herpesviruses occurs at Golgi or post-Golgi compartments, such as the trans Golgi network (TGN); however, the final envelopment site of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is uncertain. In this study, we found novel pathways for HHV-6 assembly and release from T cells that differed, in part, from those of alphaherpesviruses. Electron microscopy showed that late in infection, HHV-6-infected cells were larger than uninfected cells and contained many newly formed multivesicular body (MVB)-like compartments that included small vesicles. These MVBs surrounded the Golgi apparatus. Mature virions were found in the MVBs and MVB fusion with plasma membrane, and the release of mature virions together with small vesicles was observed at the cell surface. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that the MVBs contained CD63, an MVB/late endosome marker, and HHV-6 envelope glycoproteins. The viral glycoproteins also localized to internal vesicles in the MVBs and to secreted vesicles (exosomes). Furthermore, we found virus budding at TGN-associated membranes, which expressed CD63, adaptor protein (AP-1) and TGN46, and CD63 incorporation into virions. Our findings suggest that mature HHV-6 virions are released together with internal vesicles through MVBs by the cellular exosomal pathway. This scenario has significant implications for understanding HHV-6's maturation pathway.
0 Cell lineages and the logic of proliferative control. It is widely accepted that the growth and regeneration of tissues and organs is tightly controlled. Although experimental studies are beginning to reveal molecular mechanisms underlying such control, there is still very little known about the control strategies themselves. Here, we consider how secreted negative feedback factors ("chalones") may be used to control the output of multistage cell lineages, as exemplified by the actions of GDF11 and activin in a self-renewing neural tissue, the mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE). We begin by specifying performance objectives-what, precisely, is being controlled, and to what degree-and go on to calculate how well different types of feedback configurations, feedback sensitivities, and tissue architectures achieve control. Ultimately, we show that many features of the OE-the number of feedback loops, the cellular processes targeted by feedback, even the location of progenitor cells within the tissue-fit with expectations for the best possible control. In so doing, we also show that certain distinctions that are commonly drawn among cells and molecules-such as whether a cell is a stem cell or transit-amplifying cell, or whether a molecule is a growth inhibitor or stimulator-may be the consequences of control, and not a reflection of intrinsic differences in cellular or molecular character.
0 Compliance of the aorta in two diseases affecting vascular elasticity, familial hypercholesterolemia and diabetes: a MRI study. Arterial elasticity changes in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and diabetes mellitus (DM) with different but overlapping mechanisms. We compared aortic elasticity between 19 FH patients with the same mutation, 18 type 2 DM patients, and 30 controls, all aged 48 to 64. They underwent aortic magnetic resonance imaging, risk-factor assessment, and carotid and femoral ultrasound measurements. All patients were on adequate cardiovascular medication including statins and had established coronary heart disease (CHD). FH patients had longer-duration CHD (13.3 +/- 7.7 years) than did DM patients (5.0 +/- 3.1). Aortic compliance in the descending thoracic (DM 0.38 +/- 0.14 vs control 0.53 +/- 0.19, P = 0.032) and abdominal aorta (DM 0.45 +/- 0.20 vs control 0.66 +/- 0.25, P = 0.011) was lower in DM patients than in controls, whereas no significant difference existed between FH patients and controls. Carotid and femoral intima-media thickness was greater in FH and DM patients than in controls with no difference between patient groups. Carotid or femoral plaques appeared in 15 (79%) FH and in 10 (56%) DM patients. One control had a femoral plaque. Five FH patients showed stenosis, occlusion or both in carotid arteries. In our opinion, DM patients' lower compliance reflect mainly arterial media affecting arteriosclerosis, while FH patients' plaque status and longer duration of CHD suggest more advanced atherosclerosis. The FH patients may therefore be at increased risk for atherothrombotic events. However, due to small patient material, larger confirmatory studies are needed.
1 The PRH/Hex repressor protein causes nuclear retention of Groucho/TLE co-repressors. The PRH (proline-rich homeodomain) [also known as Hex (haematopoietically expressed homeobox)] protein is a transcription factor that functions as an important regulator of vertebrate development and many other processes in the adult including haematopoiesis. The Groucho/TLE (transducin-like enhancer) family of co-repressor proteins also regulate development and modulate the activity of many DNA-binding transcription factors during a range of diverse cellular processes including haematopoiesis. We have shown previously that PRH is a repressor of transcription in haematopoietic cells and that an Eh-1 (Engrailed homology) motif present within the N-terminal transcription repression domain of PRH mediates binding to Groucho/TLE proteins and enables co-repression. In the present study we demonstrate that PRH regulates the nuclear retention of TLE proteins during cellular fractionation. We show that transcriptional repression and the nuclear retention of TLE proteins requires PRH to bind to both TLE and DNA. In addition, we characterize a trans-dominant-negative PRH protein that inhibits wild-type PRH activity by sequestering TLE proteins to specific subnuclear domains. These results demonstrate that transcriptional repression by PRH is dependent on TLE availability and suggest that subnuclear localization of TLE plays an important role in transcriptional repression by PRH.
2 Prognostic factors of survival time after hematopoietic stem cell transplant in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients: Cox proportional hazard versus accelerated failure time models. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) after haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients using accelerated failure time (AFT), Cox proportional hazard (PH), and Cox time-varying coefficient models. 206 patients were enrolled after HSCH in Shariati Hospital between 1993 and 2007. There was evidence of marked departures from the proportional hazards assumption with two prognostic factors, relapse and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) (P < .001). Performance among AFT and Cox's models was assessed using explained variation and goodness of fit methods. Discrimination among the exponential, Weibull, generalized gamma (GG), log-logistic, and lognormal distributions was done using maximum likelihood and Akaike information criteria. The 5-year OS was 52% (95%CI: 47.3-56.7). Peak mortality hazard occurred at months 6-7 after HSCT followed by a decreasing trend. In univariate analysis, the data was better fitted by GG distribution than by other distributions. Univariate analysis using GG distribution showed a positive association between OS with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (P = .021), no relapse (P < .001), cGVHD (P < .001), neutrophil recovery (P < .001) and platelet recovery (P < .001). Based on Cox PH models; however cGVHD and relapse were the predictive factors of OS (P < .001). Multivariate analysis indicated that, OS is related to relapse (P < .001) and platelet recovery (P = .037), where predictive power of Weibull AFT models was superior to Cox PH model and Cox with time-varying coefficient (R2 = 0.46 for AFT, R2 = .21 for Cox PH and R2 = .34 for Cox time-varying coefficient). Cox-Snell residual shows Weibull AFT fitted to data better than other distributions in multivariate analysis. We concluded that AFT distributions can be a useful tool for recognizing prognostic factors of OS in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.
3 Development of monoclonal antibodies against human IRF-5 and their use in identifying the binding of IRF-5 to nuclear import proteins karyopherin-alpha1 and -beta1. IRF-5 is a direct transducer of virus-mediated and TLR-mediated signaling pathways for the expression of cytokines and chemokines which form homodimers or heterodimers with IRF-7. However, direct IRF-5-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are not available at present. These could be used to further evaluate the functions of IRF-5. In this study, we produced and characterized three mouse mAbs to human IRF-5. The binding of IRF-5 to nuclear import proteins was first identified using a mAb. His-tagged human IRF-5 protein spanning amino acid residues 193-257 was used as an antigen and three mAbs were produced. The mAbs were tested with ELISA, Western blot analysis (WB), immunofluorescent staining (IF), and immunoprecipitation (IP). In addition, the nuclear import protein which carried phosphorylated IRF-5 was identified using one of these mAbs. MAbs 5IRF8, 5IRF10 and 5IRF24 which reacted with the recombinant His-IRF-5(193-257) protein were produced. All mAbs bound to human IRF-5, but not to IRF-3 or IRF-7. They could be used for WB, IF, and IP studies. The binding of phosphorylated IRF-5 to karyopherin-alpha1 and -beta1 was also identified. Human IRF-5-specific mAbs are produced for studying the immunologic roles related to IRF-5. Phosphorylated IRF-5 is transported to the nucleus by binding to nuclear import proteins karyopherin-alpha1 and -beta1.
3 Protective effects of epigallocatechin gallate after UV irradiation of cultured human lens epithelial cells. To evaluate the protective effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) against UV irradiation of cultured human lens epithelial cells. We irradiated cultured human lens epithelial cells with a 30-second pulse from a UV lamp with an irradiance of 0.6 mW/cm2. Five minutes and 1 hour after UV irradiation, we administered 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, or 100 uM EGCG. The cell number was measured with a microscopic counting chamber and cell viability was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Compared to untreated cells, the total number of cultured human lens epithelial cells was markedly higher after UV irradiation. In a dose-dependent manner, viability was also higher in EGCG-treated cells. EGCG increased the cell count and cell viability after UV irradiation of cultured human lens epithelial cells, indicating that EGCG can protect lens epithelium against UV damage.
3 Enhanced osteoblast adhesion on nanostructured selenium compacts for anti-cancer orthopedic applications. Metallic bone implants possess numerous problems limiting their long-term efficacy, such as poor prolonged osseointegration, stress shielding, and corrosion under in vivo environments. Such problems are compounded for bone cancer patients since numerous patients receive orthopedic implants after cancerous bone resection. Unfortunately, current orthopedic materials were not originally developed to simultaneously increase healthy bone growth (as in traditional orthopedic implant applications) while inhibiting cancerous bone growth. The long-term objective of the present research is to investigate the use of nano-rough selenium to prevent bone cancer from re-occurring while promoting healthy bone growth for this select group of cancer patients. Selenium is a well known anti-cancer chemical. However, what is not known is how healthy bone cells interact with selenium. To determine this, selenium, spherical or semispherical shots, were pressed into cylindrical compacts and these compacts were then etched using 1N NaOH to obtain various surface structures ranging from the micron, submicron to nano scales. Changes in surface chemistry were also analyzed. Through these etching techniques, results of this study showed that biologically inspired surface roughness values were created on selenium compacts to match that of natural bone roughness. Moreover, results showed that healthy bone cell adhesion increased with greater nanometer selenium roughness (more closely matching that of titanium). In this manner, this study suggests that nano-rough selenium should be further tested for orthopedic applications involving bone cancer treatment.
1 Effects of heme oxygenase-1 inducer and inhibitor on experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis. Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is an animal model of posterior uveitis and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a well-known anti-oxidant factor. However, there is no report a protective role of HO-1 on EAU in vivo. To verify that HO-1 is induced in EAU by interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), that an HO-1 inducers ameliorates the associated inflammation, and that an HO-1 inhibitor exacerbates this inflammation. Forty four Lewis rats were given either 40 mol/kg hemin or 40 mol/kg SnPP (tin protoporphyrin IX) by intraperitoneal injection and twenty two uveitis control rats were injected with 0.5 mL of saline once daily 5-20 days after IRBP immunization inducing EAU. Three normal control rats were used for Western blotting and ELISA assay of HO-1. The clinical uveitis signs of inflammation were scored in the three groups from 0 to 4 on alternate three days. To confirm the clinical results, histological and immunohistochemical stain of HO-1 were performed on the day of peak inflammation and Western blotting and ELISA assay of HO-1 were performed on 6th, 12th and 18th day after IRBP immunization. Hemin, an inducer of HO-1, ameliorated the clinical signs of EAU. In contrast, SnPP-treated rats show that the severity of the clinical sign were exacerbated at the peak period of the disease. These results are roughly compatible with histological, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemical evaluations and an ELISA assay of HO-1. We suggest that HO-1 plays an important protective role in EAU.
3 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a beauty salon, the Netherlands. An outbreak of community-associated USA300 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus occurred in a beautician and 2 of her customers. Eight other persons, who were either infected (n = 5) or colonized (n = 3), were linked to this outbreak, including a family member, a household contact, and partners of customers.
2 Volume and diagnosis: an approach to cross-border care in eight European countries. Mobility of patients is a pertinent issue on the European Union's agenda. This study aimed to estimate the volume and main diagnoses of cross-border care in eight European countries, in order to provide policy makers with background information about the nature of patient mobility in Europe. This article reports the combined findings from three independent studies that compiled self-reported information on admissions data and main diagnoses from more than 200 hospitals in eight European countries. The average volume of cross-border patients accounted for less than 1% of total admissions in the hospitals studied here. Diseases of the circulatory system (mainly acute myocardial infarction) and fractures were the most common reasons for hospitalisation of European patients abroad. Deliveries and other diagnoses related to pregnancy, pneumonia, appendicitis and other diseases of the digestive system, aftercare procedures, and disorders of the eye and adnexa were also common diagnoses for this population. Hospitals should reinforce their efforts to adapt the care provided to the needs of foreign patients in treatment areas that cover the most frequent pathologies identified in this population.
0 A sequence-independent in vitro transposon-based strategy for efficient cloning of genomes of large DNA viruses as bacterial artificial chromosomes. Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) derived from genomes of large DNA viruses are powerful tools for functional delineation of viral genes. Current methods for cloning the genomes of large DNA viruses as BACs require prior knowledge of the viral sequences or the cloning of viral DNA fragments, and are tedious because of the laborious process of multiple plaque purifications, which is not feasible for some fastidious viruses. Here, we describe a novel method for cloning the genomes of large DNA viruses as BACs, which entails direct in vitro transposition of viral genomes with a BAC cassette, and subsequent recovery in Escherichia coli. Determination of insertion sites and adjacent viral sequences identify the BAC clones for genetic manipulation and functional characterization. Compared to existing methods, this new approach is highly efficient, and does not require any information on viral sequences or cloning of viral DNA fragments, and plaque purifications. This method could potentially be used for discovering previously unidentified viruses.
1 ExonMiner: Web service for analysis of GeneChip Exon array data. Some splicing isoform-specific transcriptional regulations are related to disease. Therefore, detection of disease specific splice variations is the first step for finding disease specific transcriptional regulations. Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array can measure exon-level expression profiles that are suitable to find differentially expressed exons in genome-wide scale. However, exon array produces massive datasets that are more than we can handle and analyze on personal computer. We have developed ExonMiner that is the first all-in-one web service for analysis of exon array data to detect transcripts that have significantly different splicing patterns in two cells, e.g. normal and cancer cells. ExonMiner can perform the following analyses: (1) data normalization, (2) statistical analysis based on two-way ANOVA, (3) finding transcripts with significantly different splice patterns, (4) efficient visualization based on heatmaps and barplots, and (5) meta-analysis to detect exon level biomarkers. We implemented ExonMiner on a supercomputer system in order to perform genome-wide analysis for more than 300,000 transcripts in exon array data, which has the potential to reveal the aberrant splice variations in cancer cells as exon level biomarkers. ExonMiner is well suited for analysis of exon array data and does not require any installation of software except for internet browsers. What all users need to do is to access the ExonMiner URL http://ae.hgc.jp/exonminer. Users can analyze full dataset of exon array data within hours by high-level statistical analysis with sound theoretical basis that finds aberrant splice variants as biomarkers.
0 Impact of innate immunity in a subset of children with autism spectrum disorders: a case control study. Among patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) evaluated in our clinic, there appears to be a subset that can be clinically distinguished from other ASD children because of frequent infections (usually viral) accompanied by worsening behavioural symptoms and/or loss/decrease in acquired skills. This study assessed whether these clinical features of this ASD subset are associated with atopy, asthma, food allergy (FA), primary immunodeficiency (PID), or innate immune responses important in viral infections. This study included the ASD children described above (ASD test, N = 26) and the following controls: ASD controls (N = 107), non-ASD controls with FA (N = 24), non-ASD controls with chronic rhinosinusitis/recurrent otitis media (CRS/ROM; N = 38), and normal controls (N = 43). We assessed prevalence of atopy, asthma, FA, CRS/ROM, and PID. Innate immune responses were assessed by measuring production of proinflammatory and counter-regulatory cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in response to agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), with or without pre-treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 agonist. Non-IgE mediated FA was equally prevalent in both ASD test and ASD control groups, occurring at higher frequency than in the non-ASD controls. Allergic rhinitis, atopic/non-atopic asthma, and atopic dermatitis were equally prevalent among the study groups except for the CRS/ROM group in which non-atopic asthma was more prevalent (52.6%). CRS/ROM and specific polysaccharide antibody deficiency (SPAD) were more prevalent in the ASD test group than in the ASD control, FA, and normal control groups: 23.1% vs. < 5% for CRS/ROS and 19.2% vs. < 1% for SPAD. However, CRS/ROM patients had the highest prevalence of SPAD (34.2%). When compared to ASD and normal case controls, PBMCs from 19 non-SPAD, ASD test group children produced: 1) less IL-1beta with a TLR7/8 agonist, less IL-10 with a TLR2/6 agonist, and more IL-23 with a TLR4 agonist without LPS pre-treatment, and 2) less IL-1beta with TLR4/7/8 agonists with LPS pre-treatment. These are cytokines associated with the neuro-immune network. Clinical features of the ASD test group were not associated with atopy, asthma, FA, or PID in our study but may be associated with altered TLR responses mediating neuro-immune interactions.
2 Effect of muscle relaxants on short-term results of exotropia surgery: a focus on resection procedures. We investigated the effect of muscle relaxants (atracurium) on the outcomes of intermittent exotropia surgery under general anesthesia, with a focus on resection procedures. Thirty four patients who underwent recession and resection (R&R) were divided into two groups: atracurium usage (group A, n=18) and no atracurium usage (group B, n=16). Patients were divided into two subgroups according to the amount of resection of the medial rectus (MR): less than 5 mm (group 1, n=13) or 5 mm and greater (group 2, n=21). Deviation angles were compared between groups and subgroups. Surgical outcome was defined as successful if distant deviation angles were equal to or less than 10 prism diopters. The overall postoperative deviation angles did not show statistically significant differences between groups A and B. However, in patients with larger MR resections (> or = 5 mm), the 1 week postoperative distant deviation was significantly larger in group A (1.8+/-2.6 PD) than in group B (-1.6+/-4.6 PD, p=0.048 by t-test). The overall undercorrection rate at 3 months postoperatively for group A was 16.7%, which was higher than that of group B (6.3%), and the difference was even larger in subgroups with larger MR resections (> or = 5 mm): 18.2% in group A and 0% in group B. Patients who underwent R&R procedures under general anesthesia with a muscle relaxant tended to be less corrected than those without muscle relaxant, especially in the early postoperative period and with a larger MR resection equal to or greater than 5 mm. However, there was no significant difference in the later postoperative period.
0 ATR and Chk1 suppress a caspase-3-dependent apoptotic response following DNA replication stress. The related PIK-like kinases Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) play major roles in the regulation of cellular responses to DNA damage or replication stress. The pro-apoptotic role of ATM and p53 in response to ionizing radiation (IR) has been widely investigated. Much less is known about the control of apoptosis following DNA replication stress. Recent work indicates that Chk1, the downstream phosphorylation target of ATR, protects cells from apoptosis induced by DNA replication inhibitors as well as IR. The aim of the work reported here was to determine the roles of ATM- and ATR-protein kinase cascades in the control of apoptosis following replication stress and the relationship between Chk1-suppressed apoptotic pathways responding to replication stress or IR. ATM and ATR/Chk1 signalling pathways were manipulated using siRNA-mediated depletions or specific inhibitors in two tumour cell lines or fibroblasts derived from patients with inherited mutations. We show that depletion of ATM or its downstream phosphorylation targets, NBS1 and BID, has relatively little effect on apoptosis induced by DNA replication inhibitors, while ATR or Chk1 depletion strongly enhances cell death induced by such agents in all cells tested. Furthermore, early events occurring after the disruption of DNA replication (accumulation of RPA foci and RPA34 hyperphosphorylation) in ATR- or Chk1-depleted cells committed to apoptosis are not detected in ATM-depleted cells. Unlike the Chk1-suppressed pathway responding to IR, the replication stress-triggered apoptotic pathway did not require ATM and is characterized by activation of caspase 3 in both p53-proficient and -deficient cells. Taken together, our results show that the ATR-Chk1 signalling pathway plays a major role in the regulation of death in response to DNA replication stress and that the Chk1-suppressed pathway protecting cells from replication stress is clearly distinguishable from that protecting cells from IR.
2 Control of IGF-I levels with titrated dosing of lanreotide Autogel over 48 weeks in patients with acromegaly. An essential criterion for control of acromegaly is normalization of IGF-I levels. Somatostatin analogues act to suppress IGF-I and GH levels. To assess the efficacy and safety of 48 weeks titrated dosing of lanreotide Autogel. Open-label, multicentre, phase III, 48-week trial. Patients with active acromegaly (IGF-I levels > 1.3 times upper limit of age-adjusted normal range) were recruited. Twelve injections of lanreotide Autogel were given at 28-day intervals: during the 16-week fixed-dose phase, patients received 90 mg; in the 32-week dose-titration phase, patients received 60, 90 or 120 mg according to GH and IGF-I levels. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed to determine the proportion of patients with normalized age-adjusted IGF-I levels at study end. Secondary evaluations included GH levels, clinical acromegaly signs and safety. Fifty-seven of 63 patients completed the study. Lanreotide Autogel resulted in normalized age-adjusted IGF-I levels in 27 patients (43%, 95% CI 31-55). Mean GH levels decreased from 6.2 to 1.5 microg/l at study end, with 53 of 62 patients (85%) having GH levels < or = 2.5 microg/l (95% CI 76.7-94.3) and 28 of 62 patients (45%) with levels < 1 microg/l (95% CI 32.8-57.6). Twenty-four (38%) had both normal IGF-I levels and GH levels < or = 2.5 microg/l. Acromegaly symptoms reduced significantly in most patients throughout the study. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, as expected for somatostatin analogues. Using IGF-I as primary end-point, 48 weeks lanreotide Autogel treatment, titrated for optimal hormonal control, controlled IGF-I and GH levels effectively, reduced acromegaly symptoms and was well tolerated.
1 Identification of potential environmentally adapted Campylobacter jejuni strain, United Kingdom. In a study of Campylobacter infection in northwestern England, 2003-2006, C. jejuni multilocus sequence type (ST)-45 was associated with early summer onset and was the most prevalent C. jejuni type in surface waters. ST-45 is likely more adapted to survival outside a host, making it a key driver of transmission between livestock, environmental, and human settings.
2 Frankincense: systematic review. To assess evidence from randomised clinical trials about the effectiveness of extracts of Boswellia serrata (frankincense). Systematic review. Electronic searches on Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Amed, and Cochrane Library. Hand searches of conference proceedings, bibliographies, and departmental files. All randomised clinical trials of B serrata extract as a treatment for any human medical condition were included and studies of B serrata preparations combined with other ingredients were excluded. Titles and abstracts of all retrieved articles were read and hard copies of all relevant articles were obtained. Selection of studies, data extraction and validation were done by the author. The Jadad score was used to evaluate the methodological quality of all included trials. Of 47 potentially relevant studies, seven met all inclusion criteria (five placebo controlled, two with active controls). The included trials related to asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, osteoarthritis, and collagenous colitis. Results of all trials indicated that B serrata extracts were clinically effective. Three studies were of good methodological quality. No serious safety issues were noted. The evidence for the effectiveness of B serrata extracts is encouraging but not compelling.
1 Pulsed and color Doppler sonographic findings of penile Mondor's disease. This report describes the color and pulsed Doppler US findings of penile Mondor's disease. The pulsed Doppler US findings of penile Mondor's disease have not been previously published, so we report here for the first time on the cavernosal arterial flow signal pattern of penile Mondor's disease. Penile Mondor's disease is rare disease that's characterized by thrombosis in the dorsal vein of the penis. The previous reports on penile Mondor's disease are concerned with the color Doppler US finding without the flow signals in this area, but these findings are insufficient to understand the hemodynamics in penile Mondor's disease. We report for the first time on a cavernosal artery flow signal pattern of low peak systolic velocity and high-resistance.
1 Increased secretion and expression of myostatin in skeletal muscle from extremely obese women. Obesity is associated with endocrine abnormalities that predict the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. Because skeletal muscle has been shown to secrete proteins that could be used as biomarkers, we characterized the secreted protein profile of muscle cells derived from extremely obese (BMI 48.8 +/- 14.8 kg/m(2); homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] 3.6 +/- 1.0) relative to lean healthy subjects (BMI 25.7 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2); HOMA 0.8 +/- 0.2). We hypothesized that skeletal muscle would secrete proteins that predict the severity of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we used a "bottom-up" experimental design using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in culture (SILAC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectometry/mass spectometry (LC-MS/MS) to both identify and quantify proteins secreted from cultured myotubes derived from extremely obese compared with healthy nonobese women. Using SILAC, we discovered a 2.9-fold increase in the secretion of myostatin from extremely obese human myotubes. The increased secretion and biological activity of myostatin were validated by immunoblot (3.16 +/- 0.18, P < 0.01) and a myoblast proliferation assay using conditioned growth medium. Myostatin was subsequently shown to increase in skeletal muscle (23%, P < 0.05) and plasma (35%, P < 0.05) and to correlate (r(2) = 0.6, P < 0.05) with the severity of insulin resistance. Myostatin is a potent antianabolic regulator of muscle mass that may also play a role in energy metabolism. These findings show that increased expression of myostatin in skeletal muscle with obesity and insulin resistance results in elevated circulating myostatin. This may contribute to systemic metabolic deterioration of skeletal muscle with the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes.
2 Sutureless vitrectomy. Sutureless vitrectomy has rapidly been accepted as an essential part of a vitreoretinal surgical setup. The size and structure of the wound along with near intact conjunctival covering makes the incision self-sealing and safe. This allows the vitrectomy instruments to be used without creating an initial limited peritomy to expose bare sclera, and obviates the need for sutures at the end of the procedure. Wound construction is the essential step in ensuring postoperative wound stability. Both one-step and two-step wound constructions have been described. Key points include an oblique, tunneled approach to ensure a valve-like effect as well as misalignment of conjunctival and scleral wounds by displacing conjunctiva during construction. Advantages include decreased operative times in certain cases and decreased postoperative inflammation, early postoperative rehabilitation, improved patient comfort, and minimal conjunctival damage. Complications are based around wound competence, hypotony, and its relationship to endophthalmitis rates. Early reports highlighted an increase in endophthalmitis though further studies are required to accurately assess the incidence. Endophthalmitis has not been reported in cases that underwent fluid/air exchange. This review focuses on techniques, benefits, complications, personal experiences, and the safety profiles of sutureless vitrectomy systems. A literature review was undertaken using 'Medline' and 'Pubmed'. Search terms included sutureless vitrectomy, 20 gauge, 23 gauge, 25 gauge, and transconjunctival and small gauge vitrectomy.
3 Identification of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 expression in peripheral circulating tumor cells in metastatic prostate cancer patients: a preliminary study. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a kind of transcriptional repressor, is reportedly over-expressed in metastatic prostate cancer. In this study, we analyzed EZH2 mRNA in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood as a biomarker in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Ber-EP4 coated immunomagnetic beads were used to harvest CTCs, and mRNA was isolated by oligo- dT conjugated immunomagnetic beads. Reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction for EZH2 mRNA was performed and the expression density was measured. The sensitivity of this test for detection of EZH2 mRNA was determined by serial dilutions of a human prostate cancer cell line. Blood samples were collected from 20 patients each with metastatic or localized prostate cancer and 10 healthy volunteers. Sensitivity experiments showed that the test was highly sensitive as it could detect 10 tumor cells per 5 mL. EZH2 mRNA expression was obtained from peripheral blood samples of patients and control subjects. EZH2 mRNA expression density in the metastatic prostate cancer group was significantly higher than in the control (p=0.023) and localized prostate cancer groups (p=0.019). There was no difference between the control and localized prostate cancer groups (p > 0.05). EZH2 mRNA expression in circulating epithelial cells represents a promising marker for detecting early metastasis in prostate cancer. However, more specific and sensitive techniques for detection of CTCs are needed to avoid mononuclear cell contamination.
0 Use of long-term cultured embryoid bodies may enhance cardiomyocyte differentiation by BMP2. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can proliferate for a prolonged period and differentiate into cardiomyocytes in vitro. Recent studies used bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) to generate cardiomyocytes from hESCs, however, all those studies used early embryoid bodies (EBs) and did not retrieve cardiomyocytes with a high yield. In this study, we treated long-term cultured EBs with BMP2 in order to promote differentiation into cardiomyocytes from hESCs. hESC lines, including SNUhES3 and SNUhES4, were used in this study. Undifferentiated hESC colonies were detached to form EBs and cultured for up to 30 days. These long-term cultured EBs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes in serum-containing media. In our protocol, BMP2 was applied for 5 days after attachment of EBs. Cardiac specific markers, beating of differentiated cells and electron microscopic (EM) ultrastructures were evaluated and analyzed. Compared to 10-day or 20-day EBs, 30-day EBs showed a higher expression level of cardiac specific markers, Nkx2.5 and a-myosin heavy chain (aMHC). Treatment of BMP2 increased expression of cardiac troponin (cTn) I and a-actinin when evaluated at 20 days after attachment of 30-day EBs. Beating of differentiated cells was observed from 7 to 20 days after attachment. Moreover, EM findings demonstrated fine structures such as Z bands in these differentiated cardiomyocytes. These long-term cultured EBs yielded cardiomyocytes with an efficiency of as high as 73.6% when assessed by FACS. We demonstrated that the use of long-term cultured EBs may enhance differentiation into cardiomyocytes from hESCs when treated with BMP2.
0 Genomic organization and phylogenetic utility of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) lymphotoxin-alpha and lymphotoxin-beta. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are among the most common mammals in North America and are important reservoirs of several human pathogens, including Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV). SNV can establish a life-long apathogenic infection in deer mice, which can shed virus in excrement for transmission to humans. Patients that die from hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) have been found to express several proinflammatory cytokines, including lymphotoxin (LT), in the lungs. It is thought that these cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of HCPS. LT is not expressed by virus-specific CD4+ T cells from infected deer mice, suggesting a limited role for this pathway in reservoir responses to hantaviruses. We have cloned the genes encoding deer mouse LTalpha and LTbeta and have found them to be highly similar to orthologous rodent sequences but with some differences in promoters elements. The phylogenetic analyses performed on the LTalpha, LTbeta, and combined data sets yielded a strongly-supported sister-group relationship between the two murines (the house mouse and the rat). The deer mouse, a sigmodontine, appeared as the sister group to the murine clade in all of the analyses. High bootstrap values characterized the grouping of murids. No conspicuous differences compared to other species are present in the predicted amino acid sequences of LTalpha or LTbeta; however, some promoter differences were noted in LTbeta. Although more extensive taxonomic sampling is required to confirm the results of our analyses, the preliminary findings indicate that both genes (analyzed both separately and in combination) hold potential for resolving relationships among rodents and other mammals at the subfamily level.
3 Laboratory survey of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in New York City, 1993-1995. Wide geographic variation in the prevalence of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae demonstrates the importance of tracking antimicrobial resistance locally. This survey of hospital microbiology laboratories in New York City found that penicillin resistance (MIC > or = 2.0 micrograms/ml) increased from 1.5% of S. pneumoniae isolates in 1993 to 6.3% in 1995 and that in 1995, one-third of isolates nonsusceptible to penicillin (MIC > or = 0.1 microgram/ml) were also nonsusceptible to an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (MIC > or = 1 microgram/ml).
3 Alpha-methylprednisolone conjugated cyclodextrin polymer-based nanoparticles for rheumatoid arthritis therapy. A glycinate derivative of alpha-methylprednisolone (MP) was prepared and conjugated to a linear cyclodextrin polymer (CDP) with a loading of 12.4% w/w. The polymer conjugate (CDP-MP) self-assembled into nanoparticles with a size of 27 nm. Release kinetics of MP from the polymer conjugate showed a half-life (t1/2) of 50 h in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and 19 h in human plasma. In vitro, the proliferation of human lymphocytes was suppressed to a similar extent but with a delayed effect when CDP-MP was compared with free MP. In vivo, CDP-MP was administered intravenously to mice with collagen-induced arthritis and compared with free MP. CDP-MP was administered weekly for six weeks (0.07, 0.7, and 7 mg/kg/week) and MP was administered daily for six weeks (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg/day). Body weight changes were minimal in all animals. After 28 days, a significant decrease in arthritis score was observed in animals treated weekly with an intermediate or high dose of CDP-MP. Additionally, dorsoplantar swelling was reduced to baseline in animals treated with CDP-MP at the intermediate and high dose level. Histological evaluation showed a reduction in synovitis, pannus formation and disruption of architecture at the highest dose level of CDP-MP. MP administered daily at equivalent cumulative doses showed minimal efficacy in this model. This study demonstrates that conjugation of MP to a cyclodextrin-polymer may improve its efficacy, leading to lower doses and less frequent administration for a safer and more convenient management of rheumatoid arthritis.
1 CT and MRI findings of sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen: spoke wheel pattern. Sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen is a recently described benign pathologic entity that is characterized by round shaped vascular spaces that are lined by endothelial cells, and the spaces are circumscribed by granulomatoid structures. Microscopically, all the reported cases had multiple angiomatoid nodules in a fibrosclerotic stroma. Each angiomatoid nodule was made up of slit-like, round or irregular shaped vascular spaces that were lined by endothelial cells and interspersed ovoid cells. We present here the CT and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR findings of a patient with sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation. The spoke-wheel pattern that was observed on MRI in this case may be an important imaging clue for making the correct diagnosis of this benign lesion.
1 Alternative methods to analyse the impact of HIV mutations on virological response to antiviral therapy. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square (PLS) regression may be useful to summarize the HIV genotypic information. Without pre-selection each mutation presented in at least one patient is considered with a different weight. We compared these two strategies with the construction of a usual genotypic score. We used data from the ANRS-CO3 Aquitaine Cohort Zephir sub-study. We used a subset of 87 patients with a complete baseline genotype and plasma HIV-1 RNA available at baseline and at week 12. PCA and PLS components were determined with all mutations that had prevalences >0. For the genotypic score, mutations were selected in two steps: 1) p-value < 0.01 in univariable analysis and prevalences between 10% and 90% and 2) backwards selection procedure based on the Cochran-Armitage Test. The predictive performances were compared by means of the cross-validated area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Virological failure was observed in 46 (53%) patients at week 12. Principal components and PLS components showed a good performance for the prediction of virological response in HIV infected patients. The cross-validated AUCs for the PCA, PLS and genotypic score were 0.880, 0.868 and 0.863, respectively. The strength of the effect of each mutation could be considered through PCA and PLS components. In contrast, each selected mutation contributes with the same weight for the calculation of the genotypic score. Furthermore, PCA and PLS regression helped to describe mutation clusters (e.g. 10, 46, 90). In this dataset, PCA and PLS showed a good performance but their predictive ability was not clinically superior to that of the genotypic score.
2 Behavioral economic assessment of price and cocaine consumption following self-administration histories that produce escalation of either final ratios or intake. Various self-administration procedures are being developed to model specific aspects of the addiction process. For example, 'increased cocaine intake over time' has been modeled by providing long access (LgA) to cocaine during daily self-administration sessions under a fixed-ratio (FR1) reinforcement schedule. In addition, 'increased time and energy devoted to acquire cocaine' has been modeled by providing access to cocaine during daily self-administration sessions under a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule. To investigate the distinctiveness of these models, the behavioral economics variables of consumption and price were applied to cocaine self-administration data. To assess changes in consumption and price, cocaine self-administration was tested across a descending series of doses (0.237-0.001 mg per injection) under an FR1 reinforcement schedule to measure drug intake in the high dose range and thresholds in the low range. Cocaine consumption remained relatively stable across doses until a threshold was reached, at which maximal responding was observed. It was found that a history of LgA training produced an increase in cocaine consumption; whereas a history of PR training produced an increase in the maximal price (P(max)) expended for cocaine. Importantly, the concepts of consumption and price were found to be dissociable. That is, LgA training produced an increase in consumption but a decrease in P(max), whereas PR training produced an increase in P(max) without increasing consumption. These results suggest that distinct aspects of the addiction process can be parsed using self-administration models, thereby facilitating the investigation of specific neurobiological adaptations that occur through the addiction process.
3 Cystathionine beta-synthase p.S466L mutation causes hyperhomocysteinemia in mice. Missense mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene are the most common cause of clinical homocystinuria in humans. The p.S466L mutation was identified in a homocystinuric patient, but enzymatic studies with recombinant protein show this mutant to be highly active. To understand how this mutation causes disease in vivo, we have created mice lacking endogenous mouse CBS and expressing either wild-type (Tg-hCBS) or p.S466L (Tg-S466L) human CBS under control of zinc inducible metallothionein promoter. In the presence of zinc, we found that the mean serum total homocysteine (tHcy) of Tg-S466L mice was 142+/-55 microM compared to 16+/-13 microM for hCBS mice. Tg-S466L mice also had significantly higher levels of total free homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine in liver and kidney. Only 48% of Tg-S466L mice had detectable CBS protein in the liver, whereas all the Tg-hCBS animals had detectable protein. Surprisingly, CBS mRNA was significantly elevated in Tg-S466L animals compared to Tg-hCBS, implying that the reduction in p.S466L protein was occurring due to posttranscriptional mechanisms. In Tg-S466L animals with detectable liver CBS, the enzyme formed tetramers and was active, but lacked inducibility by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). However, even in Tg-S466L animals that had in vitro liver CBS activity equivalent to Tg-hCBS animals there was significant elevation of serum tHcy. Our results show that p.S466L causes homocystinuria by affecting both the steady state level of CBS protein and by reducing the efficiency of the enzyme in vivo.
3 Localized populations of CD8 MHC class I tetramer SIV-specific T cells in lymphoid follicles and genital epithelium. CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling viral infections. We investigated the in situ localization of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-specific T cells in lymph and genital tissues from SIV-infected macaques using MHC-class I tetramers. The majority of tetramer-binding cells localized in T cell zones and were CD8(+). Curiously, small subpopulations of tetramer-binding cells that had little to no surface CD8 were detected in situ both early and late post-infection, and in both vaginally and rectally inoculated macaques. These tetramer(+)CD8(low/-) cells were more often localized in apparent B cell follicles relative to T cell zones and more often found near or within the genital epithelium than the submucosa. Cells analyzed by flow cytometry showed similar populations of cells. Further immunohistological characterization revealed small populations of tetramer(+)CD20(-) cells inside B cell follicles and that tetramer(+) cells did not stain with gammadelta-TCR nor CD4 antibodies. Negative control tetramer staining indicated that tetramer(+)CD8(low/-) cells were not likely NK cells non-specifically binding to MHC tetramers. These findings have important implications for SIV-specific and other antigen-specific T cell function in these specific tissue locations, and suggest a model in which antigen-specific CD8+ T cells down modulate CD8 upon entering B cell follicles or the epithelial layer of tissues, or alternatively a model in which only antigen-specific CD8 T cells that down-modulate CD8 can enter B cell follicles or the epithelium.
3 Transcriptional response of rat frontal cortex following acute in vivo exposure to the pyrethroid insecticides permethrin and deltamethrin. Pyrethroids are neurotoxic pesticides that interact with membrane bound ion channels in neurons and disrupt nerve function. The purpose of this study was to characterize and explore changes in gene expression that occur in the rat frontal cortex, an area of CNS affected by pyrethroids, following an acute low-dose exposure. Rats were acutely exposed to either deltamethrin (0.3 - 3 mg/kg) or permethrin (1 - 100 mg/kg) followed by collection of cortical tissue at 6 hours. The doses used range from those that cause minimal signs of intoxication at the behavioral level to doses well below apparent no effect levels in the whole animal. A statistical framework based on parallel linear (SAM) and isotonic regression (PIR) methods identified 95 and 53 probe sets as dose-responsive. The PIR analysis was most sensitive for detecting transcripts with changes in expression at the NOAEL dose. A sub-set of genes (Camk1g, Ddc, Gpd3, c-fos and Egr1) was then confirmed by qRT-PCR and examined in a time course study. Changes in mRNA levels were typically less than 3-fold in magnitude across all components of the study. The responses observed are consistent with pyrethroids producing increased neuronal excitation in the cortex following a low-dose in vivo exposure. In addition, Significance Analysis of Function and Expression (SAFE) identified significantly enriched gene categories common for both pyrethroids, including some relating to branching morphogenesis. Exposure of primary cortical cell cultures to both compounds resulted in an increase (approximately 25%) in the number of neurite branch points, supporting the results of the SAFE analysis. In the present study, pyrethroids induced changes in gene expression in the frontal cortex near the threshold for decreases in ambulatory motor activity in vivo. The penalized regression methods performed similarly in detecting dose-dependent changes in gene transcription. Finally, SAFE analysis of gene expression data identified branching morphogenesis as a biological process sensitive to pyrethroids and subsequent in vitro experiments confirmed this predicted effect. The novel findings regarding pyrethroid effects on branching morphogenesis indicate these compounds may act as developmental neurotoxicants that affect normal neuronal morphology.
3 Effectiveness of different cleaning agents against the colonization of Candida spp and the in vitro detection of the adherence of these yeast cells to denture acrylic surfaces. The aim of this study is to examine the effect Klorhex and Fittydent, which are used as cleaning agents on the adhesion of Candida on the surfaces of acrylic denture and palatal mucosa. In addition, ability of yeasts to adhere to acrylic strips was evaluated after applying these agents in vitro. Each group of 15 patients cleaned their dentures with either Klorhex or with Fittydent. The control group cleaned their dentures with water. It was found that 62.2% of the patients had colonies of Candida species on their palatal mucosa which was reduced to 51.1% after using these cleaning agents. The colonization rate with Candida spp on their dentures was reduces from 82.2% to 68.8% using these cleaning agents. The mean adhesion value of the Candida strains isolated from the acrylic strips were found to be 75 cell/strip prior to applying the Klorhex and Fittydent and 37.5 cell/strip and 15 cell/strip after applying these agents, respectively. These results showed that Klorhex and Fittydent have a certain preventive effect on the colonization rate of Candida spp on the surface of these dentures, the palatal mucosa, as well as on the acrylic strips in vitro.
3 Malaria parasite invasion of the mosquito salivary gland requires interaction between the Plasmodium TRAP and the Anopheles saglin proteins. SM1 is a twelve-amino-acid peptide that binds tightly to the Anopheles salivary gland and inhibits its invasion by Plasmodium sporozoites. By use of UV-crosslinking experiments between the peptide and its salivary gland target protein, we have identified the Anopheles salivary protein, saglin, as the receptor for SM1. Furthermore, by use of an anti-SM1 antibody, we have determined that the peptide is a mimotope of the Plasmodium sporozoite Thrombospondin Related Anonymous Protein (TRAP). TRAP binds to saglin with high specificity. Point mutations in TRAP's binding domain A abrogate binding, and binding is competed for by the SM1 peptide. Importantly, in vivo down-regulation of saglin expression results in strong inhibition of salivary gland invasion. Together, the results suggest that saglin/TRAP interaction is crucial for salivary gland invasion by Plasmodium sporozoites.
3 Anticancer alkaloid lamellarins inhibit protein kinases. Lamellarins, a family of hexacyclic pyrrole alkaloids originally isolated from marine invertebrates, display promising anti-tumor activity. They induce apoptotic cell death through multi-target mechanisms, including inhibition of topoisomerase I, interaction with DNA and direct effects on mitochondria. We here report that lamellarins inhibit several protein kinases relevant to cancer such as cyclin-dependent kinases, dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation activated kinase 1A, casein kinase 1, glycogen synthase kinase-3 and PIM-1. A good correlation is observed between the effects of lamellarins on protein kinases and their action on cell death, suggesting that inhibition of specific kinases may contribute to the cytotoxicity of lamellarins. Structure/activity relationship suggests several paths for the optimization of lamellarins as kinase inhibitors.
3 Embryonic stem cell-specific microRNAs regulate the G1-S transition and promote rapid proliferation. Dgcr8 knockout embryonic stem (ES) cells lack microprocessor activity and hence all canonical microRNAs (miRNAs). These cells proliferate slowly and accumulate in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Here, by screening a comprehensive library of individual miRNAs in the background of the Dgcr8 knockout ES cells, we report that multiple ES cell-specific miRNAs, members of the miR-290 family, rescue the ES cell proliferation defect. Furthermore, rescued cells no longer accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These miRNAs function by suppressing several key regulators of the G1-S transition. These results show that post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs promotes the G1-S transition of the ES cell cycle, enabling rapid proliferation of these cells. Our screening strategy provides an alternative and powerful approach for uncovering the role of individual miRNAs in biological processes, as it overcomes the common problem of redundancy and saturation in the miRNA system.
0 Retinoic acid treatment of human leiomyoma cells transformed the cell phenotype to one strongly resembling myometrial cells. Uterine leiomyomas are clinically significant tumours that may develop due to an altered differentiation pathway. We have previously identified a dysregulated retinoic acid (RA) pathway that reduced retinoic exposure in human leiomyoma surgical specimens, and have shown that the leiomyoma phenotype was characterized by excessive and disorganized extracellular matrix (ECM). The goal of this study was to determine the impact of RA exposure on the disrupted ECM phenotype of leiomyomas. Study of immortalized and molecularly confirmed cells generated from surgical specimens of spontaneous uterine leiomyoma and matched myometrium. Immortalized leiomyoma and myometrial cells retained the molecular characteristics of their progenitor tissue. Proliferation of leiomyoma cells was inhibited by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent decrease in soluble extracellular collagen protein in ATRA-treated leiomyoma cells. Exposure of leiomyoma cells to ATRA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of templates for specific ECM protein production including collagen 1, collagen 4, fibronectin and versican. Notably, expression levels in treated leiomyoma cells approached those found in myometrial cells. These mRNA alterations translated into altered protein. Down-regulation was also observed among the RA pathway genes such as CYP26A1 with exposure to ATRA. Finally, ATRA down-regulated TGF-beta3 mRNA expression and the TGF-beta regulated genes in leiomyoma cells. Exposure of leiomyomas to ATRA down-regulated cell proliferation, ECM formation, RA metabolism and TGF-beta regulation, suggesting that RA exposure can alter the leiomyoma phenotype to one that more closely approximates normal myometrium.
0 Role of human polyomaviruses in respiratory tract disease in young children. KI virus was detected in respiratory secretions of 8/367 (2.2%) symptomatic and 0/96 asymptomatic children (p = 0.215). WU virus was detected in 26/367 (7.1%) symptomatic and 6/96 (6.3%) asymptomatic children (p = 1.00). These human polyomaviruses may not independently cause respiratory tract disease in young children.
3 Long-term effects on hypothalamic neuropeptides after developmental exposure to chlorpyrifos in mice. Increasing evidence from animal and human studies indicates that chlorpyrifos (CPF), similar to other organophosphorus insecticides still widely used, is a developmental neurotoxicant. Developmental exposure to CPF in rodents induces sex-dimorphic behavioral changes at adulthood, including social and agonistic responses, which suggests that CPF may interfere with maturation of neuroendocrine mechanisms. We assessed the hypothesis that CPF affects the levels of neurohypophyseal hormones acting as modulators of social behavior in mammals, such as oxytocin (OT), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and prolactin (PRL). Pregnant female mice were orally administered with either vehicle (peanut oil) or 3 or 6 mg/kg CPF on gestational day (GD) 15 to GD18, and offspring were treated subcutaneously with either vehicle or 1 or 3 mg/kg CPF on postnatal days (PNDs) 11 to PND14. Dose levels were chosen to avoid systemic toxicity and inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase. Offspring were sacrificed at 5 months of age, and expression of OT, AVP, and PRL was analyzed in the hypothalamus by Western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. Both male and female mice showed dose-related enhancement of OT expression, with males presenting the more intense effect. AVP expression was significantly reduced in male mice at the higher prenatal and postnatal dose. We observed no significant effect on PRL expression in either sex. Overall, outcomes were mainly attributable to fetal exposure, whereas postnatal doses appeared to potentiate the prenatal effects. Our data indicate that developmental exposure to CPF may permanently interfere with specific key signaling proteins of the hypothalamic peptidergic system, with time-, dose-, and sex-related effects still evident at adulthood.
0 Do we use the appropriate controls for the identification of informative methylation markers for early cancer detection? It is possible to miss potential DNA methylation markers of tumorigenesis because of the initial filtering of profiling results on the basis of inappropriate controls.
3 Insect brains use image interpolation mechanisms to recognise rotated objects. Recognising complex three-dimensional objects presents significant challenges to visual systems when these objects are rotated in depth. The image processing requirements for reliable individual recognition under these circumstances are computationally intensive since local features and their spatial relationships may significantly change as an object is rotated in the horizontal plane. Visual experience is known to be important in primate brains learning to recognise rotated objects, but currently it is unknown how animals with comparatively simple brains deal with the problem of reliably recognising objects when seen from different viewpoints. We show that the miniature brain of honeybees initially demonstrate a low tolerance for novel views of complex shapes (e.g. human faces), but can learn to recognise novel views of stimuli by interpolating between or 'averaging' views they have experienced. The finding that visual experience is also important for bees has important implications for understanding how three dimensional biologically relevant objects like flowers are recognised in complex environments, and for how machine vision might be taught to solve related visual problems.
3 Is there evidence for synergy among air pollutants in causing health effects? Environmental air pollutants are inhaled as complex mixtures, but the long dominant focus of monitoring and research on individual pollutants has provided modest insight into pollutant interactions that may be important to health. Trends toward managing multiple pollutants to maximize aggregate health gains place increasing value on knowing whether the effects of combinations of pollutants are greater than the sum of the effects of individual pollutants (synergy). We reviewed selected published literature to determine whether synergistic effects of combinations of pollutants on health outcomes have actually been demonstrated. We reviewed 36 laboratory studies of combinations of ozone with other pollutants that were reported in the recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Ozone Criteria Document. We examined original reports to determine whether the experimental design tested for synergy and whether synergy was demonstrated. Fourteen studies demonstrated synergism, although synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects were sometimes observed among different outcomes or at different times after exposure. Synergisms involving O3 have been demonstrated by laboratory studies of humans and animals. We conclude that the plausibility of synergisms among environmental pollutants has been established, although comparisons are limited, and most involved exposure concentrations much higher than typical of environmental pollutants. Epidemiologic research has limited ability to address the issue explicitly.
0 Host-plant-mediated effects of Nadefensin on herbivore and pathogen resistance in Nicotiana attenuata. The adage from Shakespeare, "troubles, not as single spies, but in battalions come," holds true for Nicotiana attenuata, which is commonly attacked by both pathogens (Pseudomonas spp.) and herbivores (Manduca sexta) in its native habitats. Defense responses targeted against the pathogens can directly or indirectly influence the responses against the herbivores. Nadefensin is an effective induced defense gene against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (PST DC3000), which is also elicited by attack from M. sexta larvae, but whether this defense protein influences M. sexta's growth and whether M. sexta-induced Nadefensin directly or indirectly influences PST DC3000 resistance are unknown. M. sexta larvae consumed less on WT and on Nadefensin-silenced N. attenuata plants that had previously been infected with PST DC3000 than on uninfected plants. WT plants infected with PST DC3000 showed enhanced resistance to PST DC3000 and decreased leaf consumption by M. sexta larvae, but larval mass gain was unaffected. PST DC3000-infected Nadefensin-silenced plants were less resistant to subsequent PST DC3000 challenge, and on these plants, M. sexta larvae consumed less and gained less mass. WT and Nadefensin-silenced plants previously damaged by M. sexta larvae were better able to resist subsequent PST DC3000 challenges than were undamaged plants. These results demonstrate that Na-defensin directly mediates defense against PST DC3000 and indirectly against M. sexta in N. attenuata. In plants that were previously infected with PST DC3000, the altered leaf chemistry in PST DC3000-resistant WT plants and PST DC3000-susceptible Nadefensin-silenced plants differentially reduced M. sexta's leaf consumption and mass gain. In plants that were previously damaged by M. sexta, the combined effect of the altered host plant chemistry and a broad spectrum of anti-herbivore induced metabolomic responses was more effective than Nadefensin alone in resisting PST DC3000.
2 Robotic surgery in gynecologic field. Operative laparoscopy was initially developed in the field of gynecology earlier on and the advent of laparoscopic surgery led to advances in general surgery as well. In the last few years, a number of articles have been published on the performance of surgical procedures using the robot-assisted laparoscopy. The shortcomings of conventional laparoscopy have led to the development of robotic surgical system and future of telerobotic surgery is not far away, enabling a surgeon to operate at a distance from the operating table. The complete loss of tactile sensation is often quoted as a big disadvantage of working with robotic systems. Although the first generation da Vinci robotic surgical system provides improved imaging and instrumentation, the absence of tactile feedback and the high cost of the technology remain as limitations. New generations of the robotic surgical systems have been developed, allowing visualization of preoperative imaging during the operation. Though the introduction of robotics is very recent, the potential for robotics in several specialties is significant. However, the benefit to patients must be carefully evaluated and proven before this technology can become widely accepted in the gynecologic surgery.
2 Aging impairs recipient T cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors in response to transplantation. As increasing numbers of older people are listed for solid organ transplantation, there is an urgent need to better understand how aging modifies alloimmune responses. Here, we investigated whether aging impairs the ability of donor dendritic cells or recipient immunity to prime alloimmune responses to organ transplantation. Using murine experimental models, we found that aging impaired the host environment to expand and activate antigen specific CD8(+) T cells. Additionally, aging impaired the ability of polyclonal T cells to induce acute allograft rejection. However, the alloimmune priming capability of donor dendritic cells was preserved with aging. Aging impairs recipient responses, both T cell intrinsic and extrinsic, in response to organ transplantation.
1 Down-regulation of GRP78 is associated with the sensitivity of chemotherapy to VP-16 in small cell lung cancer NCI-H446 cells. Chemotherapy resistance remains a major obstacle for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, plays a critical role in chemotherapy resistance in some cancers. However, whether the suppression of the chaperone can enhance the sensitivity of chemotherapy in SCLC is still unclear. The SCLC NCI-H446 cells were divided into three groups: BAPTA-AM-->A23187-treated group, A23187-treated group and control-group. Immunofluorescence, western blot and RT-PCR were used to assess the expression of GRP78 at both protein and mRNA levels. Cell apoptosis and the cell cycle distributions of the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in order to evaluate the therapeutic sensitivity to VP-16. The expression of GRP78 at both protein and mRNA levels in the BAPTA-AM-->A23187-treated cells dramatically decreased as compared to that in both A23187-treated and control groups. After treatment by VP-16, the percentage of apoptotic cells in BAPTA-AM-->A23187-treated cells were: 33.4 +/- 1.01%, 48.2 +/- 1.77%, 53.0 +/- 1.43%, 56.5 +/- 2.13%, respectively, corresponding to the concentrations of BAPTA-AM 10, 15, 25, 40 microM, which was statistically significant high in comparison with the A23187-treated group and untreated-group (7.18 +/- 1.03% and 27.8 +/- 1.45%, respectively, p < 0.05). The results from analysis of cell cycle distribution showed that there was a significantly decreased in G1 phase and a dramatically increased in S phase for the BAPTA-AM-->A23187-treated cells as compared with the untreated cells. BAPTA-AM is a strong inhibitor of GRP78 in the NCI-H446 cell line, the down-regulation of GRP78 can significantly increase the sensitivity to VP-16. The suppression of GRP78 may offer a new surrogated therapeutic approach to the clinical management of lung cancer.
2 Characteristics of mechanical ventilation employed in intensive care units: a multicenter survey of hospitals. A 1D point-prevalence study was performed to describe the characteristics of conventional mechanical ventilation in intensive care units (ICUs). In addition, a survey was conducted to determine the characteristics of ICUs. A prospective, multicenter study was performed in ICUs at 24 university hospitals. The study population consisted of 223 patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or had been weaned off mechanical ventilation within the past 24 hr. Common indications for the initiation of mechanical ventilation included acute respiratory failure (66%), acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure (15%) (including tuberculosis-destroyed lung [5%]), coma (13%), and neuromuscular disorders (6%). Mechanical ventilation was delivered via an endotracheal tube in 68% of the patients, tracheostomy in 28% and facial mask with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in 4%. NIV was used in 2 centers. In patients who had undergone tracheostomy, the procedure had been performed 16.9+/-8.1 days after intubation. Intensivists treated 29% of the patients. A need for additional educational programs regarding clinical practice in the ICU was expressed by 62% of the staff and 42% of the nurses. Tuberculosis-destroyed lung is a common indication for mechanical ventilation in acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure, and noninvasive ventilation was used in a limited number of ICUs.
3 Immunological tolerance and tumor rejection in embryo-aggregated chimeric mice - lessons for tumor immunity. Rejection of transplanted tumors by the immune system is a rare event in syngeneic hosts, and is considered to be dependent on the local interaction of defensive immune reactions and tumor tolerance mechanisms. Here, we have enlisted the aid of a unique set of embryo-aggregated lineage chimeric mice derived from C57/BL6 and FVB donors to study the interplay between local and systemic tumor immunity and tolerance in rejection of mouse B16 melanoma cells, syngeneic to the C57/BL6 donor strain. Two variants of embryo-aggregated chimeric mice with either variable or no contribution of C57-derived cells to their skin were generated by the fusion of different ratios of morula stage blastomers. Chimeric mice were analyzed for s.c. growth of B16 tumors in comparison to their respective donor strains as well as normal F1 hybrids, and the relative frequencies of cellular components of the immune system by FACS analysis of peripheral blood or lymph node cells. B16 tumors grew significantly faster in mice with full chimerism in their skin as compared to syngeneic C57 or semi-syngeneic C57 x FVB F1 hosts. In contrast, s.c. tumor growth was either absent or significantly reduced in chimeric mice lacking C57-derived cells in their skin, but tolerant to C57 tissue in other organs. Comparison of the relative frequencies of various immune cells in the periphery via FACS-analysis did not reveal any significant differences between the two types of chimeric mice with respect to their donor strains. Our data suggest a complex interplay between mechanisms of local peripheral tolerance and innate antitumor mechanisms possibly involving NK cell allorecognition as a basis for the differential growth or rejection of B16 tumors in these unique chimeric mice, which we suggest to constitute a valuable new model system for the study of immune-mediated tumor rejection.
3 SPRINT: a new parallel framework for R. Microarray analysis allows the simultaneous measurement of thousands to millions of genes or sequences across tens to thousands of different samples. The analysis of the resulting data tests the limits of existing bioinformatics computing infrastructure. A solution to this issue is to use High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, which contain many processors and more memory than desktop computer systems. Many biostatisticians use R to process the data gleaned from microarray analysis and there is even a dedicated group of packages, Bioconductor, for this purpose. However, to exploit HPC systems, R must be able to utilise the multiple processors available on these systems. There are existing modules that enable R to use multiple processors, but these are either difficult to use for the HPC novice or cannot be used to solve certain classes of problems. A method of exploiting HPC systems, using R, but without recourse to mastering parallel programming paradigms is therefore necessary to analyse genomic data to its fullest. We have designed and built a prototype framework that allows the addition of parallelised functions to R to enable the easy exploitation of HPC systems. The Simple Parallel R INTerface (SPRINT) is a wrapper around such parallelised functions. Their use requires very little modification to existing sequential R scripts and no expertise in parallel computing. As an example we created a function that carries out the computation of a pairwise calculated correlation matrix. This performs well with SPRINT. When executed using SPRINT on an HPC resource of eight processors this computation reduces by more than three times the time R takes to complete it on one processor. SPRINT allows the biostatistician to concentrate on the research problems rather than the computation, while still allowing exploitation of HPC systems. It is easy to use and with further development will become more useful as more functions are added to the framework.
3 Phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain is a marker of neurodegeneration in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). To determine the profile of neurodegeneration in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). We quantitated serum levels of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) in a Brazilian pedigree of 16 affected patients and 59 carriers with LHON, both molecularly characterized as harboring the G to A mutation at nucleotide 11,778 of the mitochondrial genome. The association of subject characteristics to pNF-H levels was studied with multiple regression; pNF-H data were square-root transformed to effect normality of distribution of residuals. Relationships between the square-root of pNF-H and age and sex were investigated within groups with Pearson correlation and the two-sample t-test. Linear regression was used to assess the difference between groups and to determine if the relationship of age was different between affected individuals and carriers. Results of plotting pNF-H levels by age suggested a nonlinear, quadratic association so age squared was used in the statistical analysis. ANCOVA was used to assess the influence of age and group on pNF-H levels. In the carrier group, there was a significant correlation of square-root pNF-H (mean=0.24 ng/ml(2)) with age (r=0.30, p=0.022) and a stronger correlation with quadratic age (r=0.37, p=0.003). With a higher mean pNF-H (0.33 ng/ml(2)) for the affected group, correlations were of similar magnitude, although they were not statistically significant: age (r=0.22, p=0.42), quadratic age (r=0.22, p=0.45). There was no correlation between age and pNF-H levels (mean=0.34 ng/ml(2)) in the off-pedigree group: age (r=0.03, p=0.87), quadratic age (r=0.04, p=0.84). There was no difference between sexes and pNF-H levels in any of the groups (affected, p=0.65; carriers, p=0.19; off-pedigree, p=0.93). Elevated pNF-H released into the serum of some affected LHON patients may suggest that axonal degeneration occurs at some point after loss of visual function. Increases in pNF-H levels of carriers with increasing age, not seen in off-pedigree controls, may suggest subtle subclinical optic nerve degeneration.
0 Rhythmicity in mice selected for extremes in stress reactivity: behavioural, endocrine and sleep changes resembling endophenotypes of major depression. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, including hyper- or hypo-activity of the stress hormone system, plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders such as major depression (MD). Further biological hallmarks of MD are disturbances in circadian rhythms and sleep architecture. Applying a translational approach, an animal model has recently been developed, focusing on the deviation in sensitivity to stressful encounters. This so-called 'stress reactivity' (SR) mouse model consists of three separate breeding lines selected for either high (HR), intermediate (IR), or low (LR) corticosterone increase in response to stressors. In order to contribute to the validation of the SR mouse model, our study combined the analysis of behavioural and HPA axis rhythmicity with sleep-EEG recordings in the HR/IR/LR mouse lines. We found that hyper-responsiveness to stressors was associated with psychomotor alterations (increased locomotor activity and exploration towards the end of the resting period), resembling symptoms like restlessness, sleep continuity disturbances and early awakenings that are commonly observed in melancholic depression. Additionally, HR mice also showed neuroendocrine abnormalities similar to symptoms of MD patients such as reduced amplitude of the circadian glucocorticoid rhythm and elevated trough levels. The sleep-EEG analyses, furthermore, revealed changes in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep as well as slow wave activity, indicative of reduced sleep efficacy and REM sleep disinhibition in HR mice. Thus, we could show that by selectively breeding mice for extremes in stress reactivity, clinically relevant endophenotypes of MD can be modelled. Given the importance of rhythmicity and sleep disturbances as biomarkers of MD, both animal and clinical studies on the interaction of behavioural, neuroendocrine and sleep parameters may reveal molecular pathways that ultimately lead to the discovery of new targets for antidepressant drugs tailored to match specific pathologies within MD.
1 Quality requirements for cross-border care in Europe: a qualitative study of patients', professionals' and healthcare financiers' views. In the past decade the issue of patient mobility has emerged on the European health policy agenda. Although the volume of patients crossing borders to obtain healthcare is low, it is increasing continuously and, due to its legal, financial and medical implications, has generated considerable interest among health policy and other decision makers. However, there is little information available on the safety and patient-centredness of cross-border care and neither governments nor citizens have an explicit basis for comparing healthcare delivery in Europe. This study investigated the viewpoints of patients, professionals and healthcare financiers on the safety and patient-centredness of cross-border care. Qualitative interviews were carried out during 2005 and early 2006 with 40 patients, 30 professionals (doctors, nurses and managers) and 3 healthcare-financing bodies. Although cross-border care has become a common issue in many European countries, there remain uncertainties on the side of each of the parties addressed--patients, professionals and financiers--with regard to the provision of cross-border care. One of the most striking results of this project is the current lack of research on systematic knowledge on the quality of cross-border care. Many of the issues identified through this research may have a potential impact on the quality and safety of cross-border care and will support further investigation and help shape the health policy agenda on patients crossing borders in European Union countries.
2 Benefits of short inspiratory muscle training on exercise capacity, dyspnea, and inspiratory fraction in COPD patients. Abstract: Static lung hyperinflation has important clinical consequences in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Given that most of these patients have respiratory and peripheral muscle weakness, dyspnea and functional exercise capacity may improve as a result of inspiratory muscle training (IMT). The present study is designed to investigate the benefits of a short outpatient program of IMT on inspiratory muscle performance, exercise capacity, perception of dyspnea, and the inspiratory fraction (IF). Thirty patients (24 males, 6 females) with significant COPD (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] = 46.21% +/- 6.7% predicted, FEV1 = 33.6% +/- 8.04% predicted) were recruited for this study and had 3 months of IMT (30 minutes/day for 6 days/week) in an outpatient clinic. Following IMT, there was a statistically significant increase in inspiratory muscle performance (an increase of the maximal inspiratory pressure from 59% +/- 19.1% to 79% +/- 21.85% predicted; p = 0.0342), a decrease in dyspnea (from 5.8 +/- 0.78 to 1.9 +/- 0.57; p = 0.0001), an increase in the distance walked during the 6 minute walk test, from 245 +/- 52.37 m to 302 +/- 41.30 m, and finally an increase in the IF (the new prognostic factor in COPD) from 27.6 +/- 9.7% to 31.4% +/- 9.8%. The present study concludes that in patients with significant COPD, IMT results in improvement in performance, exercise capacity, sensation of dyspnea, and moreover an improvement in the IF prognostic factor.
1 The UA_handle: a versatile submotif in stable RNA architectures. Stable RNAs are modular and hierarchical 3D architectures taking advantage of recurrent structural motifs to form extensive non-covalent tertiary interactions. Sequence and atomic structure analysis has revealed a novel submotif involving a minimal set of five nucleotides, termed the UA_handle motif (5'XU/AN(n)X3'). It consists of a U:A Watson-Crick: Hoogsteen trans base pair stacked over a classic Watson-Crick base pair, and a bulge of one or more nucleotides that can act as a handle for making different types of long-range interactions. This motif is one of the most versatile building blocks identified in stable RNAs. It enters into the composition of numerous recurrent motifs of greater structural complexity such as the T-loop, the 11-nt receptor, the UAA/GAN and the G-ribo motifs. Several structural principles pertaining to RNA motifs are derived from our analysis. A limited set of basic submotifs can account for the formation of most structural motifs uncovered in ribosomal and stable RNAs. Structural motifs can act as structural scaffoldings and be functionally and topologically equivalent despite sequence and structural differences. The sequence network resulting from the structural relationships shared by these RNA motifs can be used as a proto-language for assisting prediction and rational design of RNA tertiary structures.
2 Owner valuation of rabies vaccination of dogs, Chad. We estimated the association between amount charged and probability that dog owners in N'Djaména, Chad, would have their dogs vaccinated against rabies. Owners would pay approximately 400-700 CFA francs (US $0.78-$1.36)/animal. To vaccinate >or=70% of dogs, and thus interrupt rabies transmission, health officials should substantially subsidize these vaccinations.
1 Detection of calcium phosphate crystals in the joint fluid of patients with osteoarthritis - analytical approaches and challenges. Clinically, osteoarthritis (OA) is characterised by joint pain, stiffness after immobility, limitation of movement and, in many cases, the presence of basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals in the joint fluid. The detection of BCP crystals in the synovial fluid of patients with OA is fraught with challenges due to the submicroscopic size of BCP, the complex nature of the matrix in which they are found and the fact that other crystals can co-exist with them in cases of mixed pathology. Routine analysis of joint crystals still relies almost exclusively on the use of optical microscopy, which has limited applicability for BCP crystal identification due to limited resolution and the inherent subjectivity of the technique. The purpose of this Critical Review is to present an overview of some of the main analytical tools employed in the detection of BCP to date and the potential of emerging technologies such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman microspectroscopy for this purpose.
3 Hospital staff and patient recognition toward opening of medical services market, and factors in selecting a foreign hospital. The objectives of this study are to compare the hospital employees' and patients' recognition and attitudes toward the opening of the medical services market, to analyze the differences between hospital employees and patients on the factors in selecting a foreign hospital. This study collected and analyzed data using systematic questionnaires that were self-administered by employees and outpatients to compare their recognition of the opening of the medical services market and the factors involved in selecting a foreign hospital. Employees exhibited a higher level of recognition than the patients. Reasons for agreement were to ensure the right of selection for both the employees and patients. Reasons for disagreement, however, were split between the two groups: degraded public characteristics of medical services, for employees; and expensive medical fees, for patients. The most urgent task to prepare for the opening of the medical services market is the improvement of the diagnosis and treatment technologies for employees, and improvement of the services provided by hospital staff for patients. Korean hospitals shall need to improve their diagnosis and treatment technologies and provide medical services of high quality in order to compete with foreign hospitals.
3 Caspase 8 promotes peripheral localization and activation of Rab5. Caspase 8 is a cysteine protease that initiates apoptotic signaling via the extrinsic pathway in a manner dependent upon association with early endosomes. Previously, we identified caspase 8 as an effector of migration, promoting motility in a manner dependent upon phosphorylation on Tyr-380 by Src family kinases and its subsequent association with Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins. Here we demonstrate the regulation of the small GTPase Rab5, which mediates early endosome formation, homotypic fusion, and maturation by caspase 8. Regulation requires the Tyr-380 phosphorylation site but not caspase proteolytic activity. Tyr-380 is essential for interaction with the Src homology 2 domains of p85alpha, a multifunctional adaptor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, that possesses Rab-GAP activity. Interaction between caspase 8 and p85alpha promotes Rab5 GTP loading, alters endosomal trafficking, and results in the accumulation of Rab5-positive endosomes at the edge of the cell. Conversely, caspase 8-dependent GTP loading of Rab5 is overcome by increased expression of p85alpha in a Rab-GAP-dependent manner. Thus, we demonstrate a novel function for caspase 8 as a modulator of p85alpha Rab-GAP activity and endosomal trafficking.
3 Concentrations of phthalate metabolites in milk, urine, saliva, and Serum of lactating North Carolina women. Phthalates are ubiquitous in the environment, but concentrations in multiple media from breast-feeding U.S. women have not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to accurately measure and compare the concentrations of oxidative monoester phthalate metabolites in milk and surrogate fluids (serum, saliva, and urine) of 33 lactating North Carolina women. We analyzed serum, saliva, urine, and milk for the oxidative phthalate metabolites mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate, mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate using isotope-dilution high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy. Because only urine lacks esterases, we analyzed it for the hydrolytic phthalate monoesters. We detected phthalate metabolites in few milk (< 10%) and saliva samples. MECPP was detected in > 80% of serum samples, but other metabolites were less common (3-22%). Seven of the 10 urinary metabolites were detectable in > or = 85% of samples. Monoethyl phthalate had the highest mean concentration in urine. Metabolite concentrations differed by body fluid (urine > serum > milk and saliva). Questionnaire data suggest that frequent nail polish use, immunoglobulin A, and fasting serum glucose and triglyceride levels were increased among women with higher concentrations of urinary and/or serum phthalate metabolites; motor vehicle age was inversely correlated with certain urinary phthalate concentrations. Our data suggest that phthalate metabolites are most frequently detected in urine of lactating women and are less often detected in serum, milk, or saliva. Urinary phthalate concentrations reflect maternal exposure and do not represent the concentrations of oxidative metabolites in other body fluids, especially milk.
0 Adaptive evolution in zinc finger transcription factors. The majority of human genes are conserved among mammals, but some gene families have undergone extensive expansion in particular lineages. Here, we present an evolutionary analysis of one such gene family, the poly-zinc-finger (poly-ZF) genes. The human genome encodes approximately 700 members of the poly-ZF family of putative transcriptional repressors, many of which have associated KRAB, SCAN, or BTB domains. Analysis of the gene family across the tree of life indicates that the gene family arose from a small ancestral group of eukaryotic zinc-finger transcription factors through many repeated gene duplications accompanied by functional divergence. The ancestral gene family has probably expanded independently in several lineages, including mammals and some fishes. Investigation of adaptive evolution among recent paralogs using d(N)/d(S) analysis indicates that a major component of the selective pressure acting on these genes has been positive selection to change their DNA-binding specificity. These results suggest that the poly-ZF genes are a major source of new transcriptional repression activity in humans and other primates.
1 Use of normalization methods for analysis of microarrays containing a high degree of gene effects. High-throughput microarrays are widely used to study gene expression across tissues and developmental stages. Analysis of gene expression data is challenging in these experiments due to the presence of significant percentages of differentially expressed genes (DEG) observed between tissues and developmental stages. Data normalization methods that are widely used today are not designed for data with a large proportion of tissue or gene effects. In our current study, we describe a novel two-dimensional nonparametric normalization method for analyzing microarray data which functions well in the absence or presence of large numbers of gene effects. Rather than relying on an assumption of low variability among most genes, the method implements a unique peak selection strategy to distinguish DEG from genes that are invariant in expression, prior to nonlinear curve fitting. We compared the method under simulated and experimental conditions with five alternative nonlinear normalization approaches: quantile, lowess, robust lowess, invariant set, and cross-correlation (Xcorr). Simulations included various percentages of simulated DEG and the experimental data used is from publicly available datasets known to be difficult to analyze due to the presence of approximately 34% DEG. We have demonstrated that the new method provides considerable improvement in the accuracy of data normalization when large proportions of gene effects are present. The performance improvement is mostly attributed to its variable selection component, which is designed to separate expression invariant genes from DEG. Adding this key component of the new method to alternative normalization approaches rescues the most of the sensitivity of these methods to gene effects. The results indicate that our method may be used without prior knowledge of or assumptions about housekeeping genes to normalize microarrays that are quite different.
3 An intronic alteration of the fibroblast growth factor 10 gene causing ALSG-(aplasia of lacrimal and salivary glands) syndrome. A combined aplasia, hypoplasia or atresia of lacrimal points and salivary glands is rarely diagnosed. Those patients suffer from epiphora, xerostomia and severe dental caries. This phenotype represents the autosomal-dominant aplasia of lacrimal and salivary glands syndrome (ALSG). Recently, aberrations of the Fibroblast Growth Factor 10 (FGF10) gene have been identified to be causative for this disorder. We performed a sequence analysis of the FGF10 gene of a patient with ALSG-syndrome and his also affected brother as well as 193 controls. The FGF10 transcript was analyzed using RNA extracted from primary fibroblasts of the patient's mucosa. We detected a novel heterozygous sequence variation in intron 2 (c.430-1, G > A) causing the ALSG syndrome. The alteration derogates the regular splice acceptor site and leads to the use of a new splice acceptor site 127 bp upstream of exon 3. The aberration was detected in the genomic DNA derived from two affected brothers, but not in 193 control individuals. Furthermore, no diseased member of the family displayed additional abnormalities that are indicative for the clinically overlapping lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital syndrome (LADD). This family-based approach revealed an intronic variation of the FGF10 gene causing ALSG-syndrome. Our results expand the mutational and clinical spectrum of the ALSG syndrome.
3 Cost-effectiveness of chagas disease vector control strategies in Northwestern Argentina. Control and prevention of Chagas disease rely mostly on residual spraying of insecticides. In Argentina, vector control shifted from a vertical to a fully horizontal strategy based on community participation between 1992 and 2004. The effects of such strategy on Triatoma infestans, the main domestic vector, and on disease transmission have not been assessed. Based on retrospective (1993-2004) records from the Argentinean Ministry of Health for the Moreno Department, Northwestern Argentina, we performed a cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis and compared the observed CE of the fully horizontal vector control strategy with the expected CE for a vertical or a mixed (i.e., vertical attack phase followed by horizontal surveillance) strategy. Total direct costs (in 2004 US$) of the horizontal and mixed strategies were, respectively, 3.3 and 1.7 times lower than the costs of the vertical strategy, due to reductions in personnel costs. The estimated CE ratios for the vertical, mixed and horizontal strategies were US$132, US$82 and US$45 per averted human case, respectively. When per diems were excluded from the costs (i.e., simulating the decentralization of control activities), the CE of vertical, mixed and horizontal strategies was reduced to US$60, US$42 and US$32 per averted case, respectively. The mixed strategy would have averted between 1.6 and 4.0 times more human cases than the fully horizontal strategy, and would have been the most cost-effective option to interrupt parasite transmission in the Department. In rural and dispersed areas where waning vertical vector programs cannot accomplish full insecticide coverage, alternative strategies need to be developed. If properly implemented, community participation represents not only the most appealing but also the most cost-effective alternative to accomplish such objectives.
1 Double infection with a resistant and a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. An immunocompetent patient was dually infected with a resistant and a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). The multidrug-resistant strain, which belongs to the W- strain/Beijing family, was first isolated after 3 months of therapy. Inappropriate treatment led to further drug resistance and unsuccessful therapy. Thus, additional infections with resistant M. tuberculosis strains should be considered when tuberculosis therapy fails.
3 An endoribonuclease functionally linked to perinuclear mRNP quality control associates with the nuclear pore complexes. Nuclear mRNA export is a crucial step in eukaryotic gene expression, which is in yeast coupled to cotranscriptional messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) assembly and surveillance. Several surveillance systems that monitor nuclear mRNP biogenesis and export have been described, but the mechanism by which the improper mRNPs are recognized and eliminated remains poorly understood. Here we report that the conserved PIN domain protein Swt1 is an RNA endonuclease that participates in quality control of nuclear mRNPs and can associate with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Swt1 showed endoribonuclease activity in vitro that was inhibited by a point mutation in the predicted catalytic site. Swt1 lacked clear sequence specificity but showed a strong preference for single-stranded regions. Genetic interactions were found between Swt1 and the THO/TREX and TREX-2 complexes, and with components of the perinuclear mRNP surveillance system, Mlp1, Nup60, and Esc1. Inhibition of the nuclease activity of Swt1 increased the levels and cytoplasmic leakage of unspliced aberrant pre-mRNA, and induced robust nuclear poly(A)(+) RNA accumulation in mlp1Delta and esc1Delta strains. Overexpression of Swt1 also caused strong nuclear poly(A)(+) RNA accumulation. Swt1 is normally distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm but becomes concentrated at nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in the nup133Delta mutant, which causes NPC clustering and defects in mRNP export. The data suggest that Swt1 endoribonuclease might be transiently recruited to NPCs to initiate the degradation of defective pre-mRNPs or mRNPs trapped at nuclear periphery in order to avoid their cytoplasmic export and translation.
3 Burkholderia pseudomallei traced to water treatment plant in Australia. Burkholderia pseudomallei was isolated from environmental specimens 1 year after an outbreak of acute melioidosis in a remote coastal community in northwestern Australia. B. pseudomallei was isolated from a water storage tank and from spray formed in a pH-raising aerator unit. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed the aerator and storage tank isolates were identical to the outbreak strain, WKo97.
3 Reduced neutrophil count in people of African descent is due to a regulatory variant in the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines gene. Persistently low white blood cell count (WBC) and neutrophil count is a well-described phenomenon in persons of African ancestry, whose etiology remains unknown. We recently used admixture mapping to identify an approximately 1-megabase region on chromosome 1, where ancestry status (African or European) almost entirely accounted for the difference in WBC between African Americans and European Americans. To identify the specific genetic change responsible for this association, we analyzed genotype and phenotype data from 6,005 African Americans from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study, and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. We demonstrate that the causal variant must be at least 91% different in frequency between West Africans and European Americans. An excellent candidate is the Duffy Null polymorphism (SNP rs2814778 at chromosome 1q23.2), which is the only polymorphism in the region known to be so differentiated in frequency and is already known to protect against Plasmodium vivax malaria. We confirm that rs2814778 is predictive of WBC and neutrophil count in African Americans above beyond the previously described admixture association (P = 3.8 x 10(-5)), establishing a novel phenotype for this genetic variant.
3 Liver cancer-derived hepatitis C virus core proteins shift TGF-beta responses from tumor suppression to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and associated liver cirrhosis represent a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. TGF-beta is an important driver of liver fibrogenesis and cancer; however, its actual impact in human cancer progression is still poorly known. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HCC-derived HCV core natural variants on cancer progression through their impact on TGF-beta signaling. We provide evidence that HCC-derived core protein expression in primary human or mouse hepatocyte alleviates TGF-beta responses in terms or growth inhibition or apoptosis. Instead, in these hepatocytes TGF-beta was still able to induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that contributes to the promotion of cell invasion and metastasis. Moreover, we demonstrate that different thresholds of Smad3 activation dictate the TGF-beta responses in hepatic cells and that HCV core protein, by decreasing Smad3 activation, may switch TGF-beta growth inhibitory effects to tumor promoting responses. Our data illustrate the capacity of hepatocytes to develop EMT and plasticity under TGF-beta, emphasize the role of HCV core protein in the dynamic of these effects and provide evidence for a paradigm whereby a viral protein implicated in oncogenesis is capable to shift TGF-beta responses from cytostatic effects to EMT development.
0 Light-induced translocation of cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase on rod disc membranes in rat retina. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) is the light-regulated effector enzyme of vertebrate rods. Upon photo-activation of rhodopsin followed by activation of transducin/GTP, PDE rapidly hydrolyzes 3', 5'-cyclic GMP (cGMP) to 5'-GMP, which results in closure of cGMP-dependent ion channels and generation of a nerve signal. In the rod photoreceptors, PDE is entirely localized within the rod outer segment (ROS), a specialized compartment consisting of thousands of disc stacks. This study investigated the effects of light on the subcellular localization of PDE in ROS. Adult rats were either dark- or light-adapted for various durations before eyes were isolated and processed for transmission electron microscopy. Immunogold electron microscopy was performed with antibodies against PDE. Lateral displacement of PDE on ROS disc membrane was analyzed from electron micrographs. PDE enzymatic activities were measured with thin layer chromatography. Light exposure induced translocation of PDE away from the edges of the dark-adapted disc membranes adjacent to the ROS plasma membrane. In dark-adapted ROS, a substantial portion (19+/-2%) of total PDE was localized near the edges of the disc membranes. Within 1 min of light exposure in the presence of GTP, over half of such PDE molecules (10+/-1% of total PDE) had moved away from the edges of the discs toward disc center. This light induced translocation of PDE was GTP dependent, as the effect was abolished when hydrolysis-resistant GTPgammaS was used in place of GTP. The percentage of PDE found near the disc edge corresponds to the fraction of PDE activity relative to maximal PDE activity revealed by limited trypsin proteolysis. These results suggest that light and GTP modulates lateral displacement of PDE, which might contribute to light-induced reduction of rod photoreceptor sensitivity.
2 The economic impact of pandemic influenza in the United States: priorities for intervention. We estimated the possible effects of the next influenza pandemic in the United States and analyzed the economic impact of vaccine-based interventions. Using death rates, hospitalization data, and outpatient visits, we estimated 89,000 to 207,000 deaths; 314,000 to 734,000 hospitalizations; 18 to 42 million outpatient visits; and 20 to 47 million additional illnesses. Patients at high risk (15% of the population) would account for approximately 84% of all deaths. The estimated economic impact would be US$71.3 to $166.5 billion, excluding disruptions to commerce and society. At $21 per vaccinee, we project a net savings to society if persons in all age groups are vaccinated. At $62 per vaccinee and at gross attack rates of 25%, we project net losses if persons not at high risk for complications are vaccinated. Vaccinating 60% of the population would generate the highest economic returns but may not be possible within the time required for vaccine effectiveness, especially if two doses of vaccine are required.
3 The neuroradiological findings of children with developmental language disorder. To investigate the general characteristics of glucose metabolism distribution and the functional deficit in the brain of children with developmental language delay (DLD), we compared functional neuroradiological studies such as positron emission tomography (PET) of a patient group of DLD children and a control group of attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children. Seventeen DLD children and 10 ADHD children under 10 years of age were recruited and divided into separate groups consisting of children less than 5 years of age or between 5 and 10 years of age. The PET findings of 4 DLD children and 6 control children whose ages ranged from 5 to 10 years were compared by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) analysis. All of the DLD children revealed grossly normal findings in brain MRIs, however, 87.5% of them showed grossly abnormal findings in their PET studies. Abnormal findings were most frequent in the thalamus. The patient group showed significantly decreased glucose metabolism in both frontal, temporal and right parietal areas (p < 0.005) and significantly increased metabolism in both occipital areas (p < 0.05) as compared to the control group. This study reveals that DLD children may show abnormal findings on functional neuroradiological studies, even though structural neuroradiological studies such as a brain MRI do not show any abnormal findings. Frequent abnormal findings on functional neuroradiological studies of DLD children, especially in the subcortical area, suggests that further research with quantitative assessments of functional neuroradiological studies recruiting more DLD children and age-matched normal controls could be helpful for understanding the pathophysiology of DLD and other disorders confined to the developmental disorder spectrum.
2 Development of Alive! (A Lifestyle Intervention Via Email), and its effect on health-related quality of life, presenteeism, and other behavioral outcomes: randomized controlled trial. Cost-effective interventions to improve diet and physical activity are a public health priority. Alive! is an email-based intervention to increase physical activity, reduce saturated and trans fats and added sugars, and increase fruit and vegetable consumption. It was shown to improve these behaviors in a large randomized controlled trial. (1) To describe the components and behavioral principles underlying Alive!, and (2) to report effects of the intervention on the secondary outcomes: health-related quality of life, presenteeism, self-efficacy, and stage of change. The Alive! behavior change model is designed to elicit healthy behaviors and promote their maintenance. Behavioral strategies include assessments followed by individualized feedback, weekly goal-setting, individually tailored goals and tips, reminders, and promotion of social support. Alive! was tested among non-medical employees of Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, who were randomized to either the intervention group or the wait-list control group. After randomization, intervention group participants chose one topic to undertake for the intervention period: increasing physical activity, increasing fruits and vegetables, or decreasing saturated and trans fats and added sugars. Pre-post questionnaires assessed changes in SF-8 health-related quality of life, presenteeism, self-efficacy, and stage of change. Mixed effects multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic regression models were used, with department as a random effect factor. Analyses were by intention to treat: the 30% (238/787) who did not respond to the follow-up questionnaires were assigned change scores of zero. Participants were 19 to 65 years (mean 44.0 +/- 10.6), and 74.3% (585/787) were female. Mean SF-8 Physical quality of life score increased significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group, 1.84 (95% CI 0.96-2.72) vs 0.72 (95% CI -0.15-1.58) respectively, P = .02. SF8 Mental score also improved significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group (P = .02). The odds ratio for improvement in self-assessed health status was 1.57 (95% CI 1.21-2.04, P < .001) for the intervention group compared to the control group. The odds ratio for having a reduction in difficulty accomplishing work tasks because of physical or emotional problems, a measure of presenteeism, was 1.47 (95% CI 1.05-2.05, P = .02) for the intervention group compared to the control group. The odds of having an improvement in self-efficacy for changing diet was 2.05 (95% CI 1.44-2.93) for the intervention vs the control group (P < .001). Greater improvement in stage of change for physical activity (P = .05), fats (P = .06), and fruits/vegetables (P = .006) was seen in the intervention group compared to the control group. Significant effects on diet and physical activity behavior change are reported elsewhere. Cost-effective methods that can reach large populations with science-based interventions are urgently needed. Alive! is a fully automated low-cost intervention shown to effect significant improvements in important health parameters.

1 Peripartum cardiomyopathy: review of the literature. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare but serious form of cardiac failure affecting women in the last months of pregnancy or early puerperium. Clinical presentation of PPCM is similar to that of systolic heart failure from any cause, and it can sometimes be complicated by a high incidence of thromboembolism. Prior to the availability of echocardiography, diagnosis was based only on clinical findings. Recently, inclusion of echocardiography has made diagnosis of PPCM easier and more accurate. Its etiopathogenesis is still poorly understood, but recent evidence supports inflammation, viral infection and autoimmunity as the leading causative hypotheses. Prompt recognition with institution of intensive treatment by a multidisciplinary team is a prerequisite for improved outcome. Conventional treatment consists of diuretics, beta blockers, vasodilators, and sometimes digoxin and anticoagulants, usually in combination. In resistant cases, newer therapeutic modalities such as immunomodulation, immunoglobulin and immunosuppression may be considered. Cardiac transplantation may be necessary in patients not responding to conventional and newer therapeutic strategies. The role of the anesthesiologist is important in perioperative and intensive care management. Prognosis is highly related to reversal of ventricular dysfunction. Compared to historically higher mortality rates, recent reports describe better outcome, probably because of advances in medical care. Based on current information, future pregnancy is usually not recommended in patients who fail to recover heart function. This article aims to provide a comprehensive updated review of PPCM covering etiopathogeneses, clinical presentation and diagnosis, as well as pharmacological, perioperative and intensive care management and prognosis, while stressing areas that require further research.
3 Discovery of a non-peptidic inhibitor of west nile virus NS3 protease by high-throughput docking. The non-structural 3 protease (NS3pro) is an essential flaviviral enzyme and therefore one of the most promising targets for drug development against West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue infections. In this work, a small-molecule inhibitor of the WNV NS3pro has been identified by automatic fragment-based docking of about 12000 compounds and testing by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of only 22 molecules. Specific binding of the inhibitor into the active site of NS3pro and its binding mode are confirmed by 15N-HSQC NMR spectra. The inhibitory activity is further validated by an enzymatic assay and a tryptophan fluorescence quenching assay. The inhibitor [4-(carbamimidoylsulfanylmethyl)-2,5-dimethylphenyl]-methylsulfanylmethanimidamide has a good ratio of binding affinity versus molecular weight (ligand efficiency of 0.33 kcal/mol per non-hydrogen atom), and thus has good potential as lead compound for further development to combat West Nile virus infections.
3 Novel biochemical markers of psychosocial stress in women. Prolonged psychosocial stress is a condition assessed through self-reports. Here we aimed to identify biochemical markers for screening and early intervention in women. Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL) 1-alpha, IL1-beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total tri-iodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), prolactin, and testosterone were measured in: 195 women on long-term sick-leave for a stress-related affective disorder, 45 women at risk for professional burnout, and 84 healthy women. We found significantly increased levels of MCP-1, VEGF and EGF in women exposed to prolonged psychosocial stress. Statistical analysis indicates that they independently associate with a significant risk for being classified as ill. MCP-1, EGF, and VEGF are potential markers for screening and early intervention in women under prolonged psychosocial stress.
1 Optimizing the diagnostic work-up of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Most diagnostic tests for acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) have been previously studied in so-called single-test evaluations. In practice, however, clinicians use more than one test in the diagnostic work-up. Since test results carry overlapping information, results from single-test studies may be confounded. The primary objective of the Amsterdam Cystitis/Urinary Tract Infection Study (ACUTIS) is to determine the (additional) diagnostic value of relevant tests from patient history and laboratory investigations, taking into account their mutual dependencies. Consequently, after suitable validation, an easy to use, multivariable diagnostic rule (clinical index) will be derived. Women who contact their GP with painful and/or frequent micturition undergo a series of possibly relevant tests, consisting of patient history questions and laboratory investigations. Using urine culture as the reference standard, two multivariable models (diagnostic indices) will be generated: a model which assumes that patients attend the GP surgery and a model based on telephone contact only. Models will be made more robust using the bootstrap. Discrimination will be visualized in high resolution histograms of the posterior UTI probabilities and summarized as 5th, 10th, 25th 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th centiles of these, Brier score and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) with 95% confidence intervals. Using the regression coefficients of the independent diagnostic indicators, a diagnostic rule will be derived, consisting of an efficient set of tests and their diagnostic values. The course of the presenting complaints is studied using 7-day patient diaries. To learn more about the natural history of UTIs, patients will be offered the opportunity to postpone the use of antibiotics. We expect that our diagnostic rule will allow efficient diagnosis of UTIs, necessitating the collection of diagnostic indicators with proven added value. GPs may use the rule (preferably after suitable validation) to estimate UTI probabilities for women with different combinations of test results. Finally, in a subcohort, an attempt is made to identify which indicators (including antibiotic treatment) are useful to prognosticate recovery from painful and/or frequent micturition.
0 Increase of universality in human brain during mental imagery from visual perception. Different complex systems behave in a similar way near their critical points of phase transitions which leads to an emergence of a universal scaling behaviour. Universality indirectly implies a long-range correlation between constituent subsystems. As the distributed correlated processing is a hallmark of higher complex cognition, I investigated a measure of universality in human brain during perception and mental imagery of complex real-life visual object like visual art. A new method was presented to estimate the strength of hidden universal structure in a multivariate data set. In this study, I investigated this method in the electrical activities (electroencephalogram signals) of human brain during complex cognition. Two broad groups--artists and non-artists--were studied during the encoding (perception) and retrieval (mental imagery) phases of actual paintings. Universal structure was found to be stronger in visual imagery than in visual perception, and this difference was stronger in artists than in non-artists. Further, this effect was found to be largest in the theta band oscillations and over the prefrontal regions bilaterally. Phase transition like dynamics was observed in the electrical activities of human brain during complex cognitive processing, and closeness to phase transition was higher in mental imagery than in real perception. Further, the effect of long-term training on the universal scaling was also demonstrated.
2 Open pulmonary thromboembolectomy in patients with major pulmonary thromboembolism. We retrospectively analyzed open pulmonary thromboembolectomy in patients with acute and chronic pulmonary thromboembolism. Between August 1990 and May 2005, 12 consecutive patients with acute and chronic pulmonary thromboembolism underwent open pulmonary thromboembolectomy at Yonsei Cardiovascular Center. Their mean age was 47.5 years, and 7 of the patients were female. Among 12 patients, 5 had acute onset, and 7 had chronic disease, and 9 patients were associated with deep venous thrombosis. Extent of pulmonary embolism was massive in 3 patients with hemodynamic instability, and submassive in 8 patients. Preoperative echocardiogram revealed elevated right ventricular pressure in all patients, and 7 patients were in NYHA functional class III or IV. Pulmonary thromboembolectomy was performed in all patients under total circulatory arrest. There were 2 hospital deaths (16.7%). Among the patients who survived, mean right ventricular pressure was decreased significantly from 64.3 mmHg to 34.0 mmHg with improvement of NYHA functional class. Open pulmonary thromboembolectomy is thought to be an immediate and definitive treatment for massive pulmonary embolism with optimal results. Even though operative mortality is still high, early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention in highly selective patients may improve the clinical outcome.
0 Synchronous adenocarcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma of the stomach. Synchronous occurrence of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and gastric cancer in the same patient has not yet been reported in the English literature. MCL comprises 2.5-7% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and is characterized by a poor prognosis with a median survival probability of 3-4 years in most series. A 62-year-old man was referred to our hospital for evaluation of an abnormal gastric lesion. The endoscopic finding was compatible with type IIc early gastric cancer (EGC) in the middle third of the stomach, and a biopsy of the lesion proved to be carcinoma. Radical total gastrectomy with splenectomy and Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy were performed. The resected specimen revealed two grossly separated lesions. Postoperative histological examination reported both adenocarcinoma and MCL. Immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for CD5, CD20, and cyclin D1 in the infiltrated lymphoid cells. MCL is an aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the current treatment approach is still unsatisfactory. Further advancements in the understanding of the synchronous occurrence of both diseases, and more efforts on investigations of treatment are needed.
3 Bone morphogenetic protein 2 induces pulmonary angiogenesis via Wnt-beta-catenin and Wnt-RhoA-Rac1 pathways. Mutations in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor II (BMPRII) are associated with pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) apoptosis and the loss of small vessels seen in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Given the low penetrance of BMPRII mutations, abnormalities in other converging signaling pathways may be necessary for disease development. We hypothesized that BMPRII supports normal PAEC function by recruiting Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathways to promote proliferation, survival, and motility. In this study, we report that BMP-2, via BMPRII-mediated inhibition of GSK3-beta, induces beta-catenin (beta-C) accumulation and transcriptional activity necessary for PAEC survival and proliferation. At the same time, BMP-2 mediates phosphorylated Smad1 (pSmad1) or, with loss of BMPRII, pSmad3-dependent recruitment of Disheveled (Dvl) to promote RhoA-Rac1 signaling necessary for motility. Finally, using an angiogenesis assay in severe combined immunodeficient mice, we demonstrate that both beta-C- and Dvl-mediated RhoA-Rac1 activation are necessary for vascular growth in vivo. These findings suggest that the recruitment of both canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways is required in BMP-2-mediated angiogenesis.
1 T cell receptor-independent basal signaling via Erk and Abl kinases suppresses RAG gene expression. Signal transduction pathways guided by cellular receptors commonly exhibit low-level constitutive signaling in a continuous, ligand-independent manner. The dynamic equilibrium of positive and negative regulators establishes such a tonic signal. Ligand-independent signaling by the precursors of mature antigen receptors regulates development of B and T lymphocytes. Here we describe a basal signal that controls gene expression profiles in the Jurkat T cell line and mouse thymocytes. Using DNA microarrays and Northern blots to analyze unstimulated cells, we demonstrate that expression of a cluster of genes, including RAG-1 and RAG-2, is repressed by constitutive signals requiring the adapter molecules LAT and SLP-76. This TCR-like pathway results in constitutive low-level activity of Erk and Abl kinases. Inhibition of Abl by the drug STI-571 or inhibition of signaling events upstream of Erk increases RAG-1 expression. Our data suggest that physiologic gene expression programs depend upon tonic activity of signaling pathways independent of receptor ligation.
0 Effect of parental type 2 diabetes on offspring with type 1 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to study the association between a parental history of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic profile as well as the presence of the metabolic syndrome and diabetes complications in patients with type 1 diabetes. This was a cross-sectional study design in 1,860 patients with type 1 diabetes from the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) Study (620 patients with and 1,240 age-matched patients without a parental history of type 2 diabetes). Information on parental history was received from the type 1 diabetic offspring by a standardized questionnaire. Patients with type 1 diabetes and a positive parental history of type 2 diabetes had a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (44 vs. 38%; P = 0.013) and a metabolic profile related to insulin resistance (higher BMI, larger waist circumference, and higher triglycerides, A1C, and insulin dose per kilogram) and also had a later onset of type 1 diabetes (17.2 +/- 9.2 vs. 16.1 +/- 8.9 years; P = 0.008), which was also confirmed in the publicly available Diabetes Control and Complications Trial data set. In contrast, no association was observed with blood pressure, diabetes complications, or HLA genotype distribution. Parental history of type 2 diabetes was independently associated with age at onset of type 1 diabetes (odds ratio 1.02 [95% CI 1.01-1.03]), BMI (1.07 [1.02-1.12]), triglycerides (1.18 [1.03-1.35]), and insulin dose per kilogram (1.63 [1.04-2.54]). Parental history of type 2 diabetes is associated with a later onset of type 1 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and a metabolic profile related to insulin resistance.
3 Diagnosis of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation: a comparative study using criteria from the International Society versus the Korean Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Since 1993, Koreans have used diagnostic criteria set by the Korean Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (KSTH) in the diagnosis of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In 2001, the Scientific and Standardization Committee (SCC) of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) proposed new diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of overt DIC. We wanted to compare the use of the ISTH versus KSTH criteria in the diagnosis of overt DIC. We enrolled 131 patients over the age of 15 years, who had been admitted and diagnosed as having DIC from May 2000 to April 2005 at the Youngdong Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Of the 131 patients, there were 71 males and 60 females, with a median age of 61 years. Hemostatic tests, including platelet counts, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen level and D-dimer, were evaluated based on the respective scoring systems. To assess the concordance between the two diagnostic systems, we used the Student's t-test and the K-coefficient. There were 79 patients compatible with the ISTH criteria and 63 patients with the KSTH criteria. Sixty-one patients were compatible with both diagnostic systems. The grade of agreement, or concordance rate, was 84.7% and the K-coefficient, or interrater reliability, was as low as 0.6 without significance. However, if we scored 1 point for a fibrinogen level of 100-150 mg/dL, and 2 points for a level below 100 mg/dL, for the ISTH criteria, then 63 patients were compatible with both diagnostic systems, and the concordance rate increased to 85.5% and the K-coefficient to 0.71 with significance. To achieve good agreement between the ISTH and KSTH diagnostic systems for overt DIC, we highly recommend changing the plasma fibrinogen cut-off value in the ISTH criteria from 100mg/dL to 150 mg/dL and scoring up to 2 points for a level below 100 mg/dL.
3 Antibody-based therapies for emerging infectious diseases. In the 19th century, it was discovered that immune sera were useful in treating infectious diseases. Serum therapy was largely abandoned in the 1940s because of the toxicity associated with the administration of heterologous sera and the introduction of effective antimicrobial chemotherapy. Recent advances in the technology of monoclonal antibody production provide the means to generate human antibody reagents and reintroduce antibody therapies, while avoiding the toxicities associated with serum therapy. Because of the versatility of antibodies, antibody-based therapies could, in theory, be developed against any existing pathogen. The advantages of antibody-based therapies include versatility, low toxicity, pathogen specificity, enhancement of immune function, and favorable pharmacokinetics; the disadvantages include high cost, limited usefulness against mixed infections, and the need for early and precise microbiologic diagnosis. The potential of antibodies as antiinfective agents has not been fully tapped. Antibody-based therapies constitute a potentially useful option against newly emergent pathogens.
1 Reproductive intentions and outcomes among women on antiretroviral therapy in rural Uganda: a prospective cohort study. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) may influence the biological, social and behavioral determinants of pregnancy in HIV-infected women. However, there are limited longitudinal data on the reproductive intentions and outcomes among women on ART in Africa. METHODOLOGY /PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a prospective cohort design, we analyzed trends in desire for children and predictors of pregnancy among a cohort of 733 HIV-infected women in rural Uganda who initiated ART between May 2003 and May 2004 and were followed up in their homes until June 2006. Women answered in-depth social and behavioral questionnaires administered every quarter in year 1 after initiating ART, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Use of family planning methods was assessed at 18 and 24 months after starting ART. We tested for non-constant pregnancy incidence by using a shape parameter test from the Weibull distribution. We modeled repeated measurements of all variables related to the women's desire for children over time using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) extension to the logistic regression model. Risk factors for pregnancy were examined using Cox proportional hazards model. 711 women eligible for the study were followed-up for a median time of 2.4 years after starting ART. During this time, less than 7% of women reported wanting more children at any time point yet 120 (16.9%) women experienced 140 pregnancies and pregnancy incidence increased from 3.46 per 100 women-years (WY) in the first quarter to 9.5 per 100 WY at 24 months (p<0.0001). This was paralleled by an increase in the proportion of women reporting sexual activity in the past 3 months, from 24.4% at baseline to 32.5% over 24 months of follow-up (p = 0.001). Only 14% of women used permanent or semi-permanent family planning methods by their second year on ART. In the multivariate model, younger age (HR = 2.71 per 10-year decrease, 95% CI: 2.95-3.78), having a BMI>18.5 (HR = 1.09, CI: 1.01-1.18) and not having used condoms consistently in the last 3 months (HR = 1.79, CI: 1.02-3.13) were independently associated with pregnancy. Women on ART and their partners should be consistently counseled on the effects of ART in restoring fertility, and offered regularly free and comprehensive family planning services as part of their standard package of care.
1 Antenatal diagnosis of iniencephaly: sonographic and MR correlation: a case report. Iniencephaly is an uncommon and fatal neural tube defect involving the occiput and inion, this occurs together with rachischisis of the cervical and thoracic spine, and retroflexion of the head. We report the ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of a case of iniencephaly with clubfeet and arthrogryposis. The diagnosis of iniencephaly is easy to make on ultrasound due to the typical star-gazing fetus. However, the details of the fetal brain and spinal cord may not be adequately delineated on US. We found MR imaging to be superior for depicting central nervous system abnormalities. MR imaging has evolved as an imaging modality and it is complementary to fetal US, yet US remains the screening modality of choice.
2 Efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide for eyes with postvitrectomy diabetic vitreous hemorrhage. To evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVT) for the management of postvitrectomy diabetic vitreous hemorrhage. The authors conducted a retrospective study of patients with postvitrectomy diabetic vitreous hemorrhage who were administered 4 mg (0.1 cc) of triamcinolone acetonide ophthalmic suspension. Ocular history, adverse events, BCVA, intraocular pressure, external eye examination, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, fundus examination, B-scan ultrasonography, and fundus photography were assessed on day 1, weeks 1, 2, and 4 and months 2 and 3. There were 19 eyes of 18 consecutive patients with mean follow-up after IVT injection of 28 weeks. Of the 19 eyes, 17 eyes (89%) experienced clearing of vitreous hemorrhage within 1 to 5 weeks (mean, 1.7 weeks) with visible triamcinolone precipitates along with blood clot in the inferior aspect of fundus. Of these 17 eyes, 12 eyes (63%) maintained vitreous hemorrhage-free condition at last follow-up with a mean visual acuity of 20/63 (range, 20/320 20/25), whereas 5 (29%) developed recurrent vitreous hemorrhage after clearing of vitreous hemorrhage. Vitreous hemorrhage was not cleared in 2 eyes, which required surgical procedures. IVT injection may be beneficial for clearing recurrent postvitrectomy Diabetic Vitreous Hemorrhage.
1 In vivo insulin sensitivity and secretion in obese youth: what are the differences between normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes? Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) represents a pre-diabetic state. Controversy continues in regards to its pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in insulin sensitivity (IS) and secretion in obese adolescents with IGT compared with those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and type 2 diabetes. A total of 12 obese adolescents with NGT, 19 with IGT, and 17 with type 2 diabetes underwent evaluation of insulin sensitivity (3-h hyperinsulinemic [80 micro/m(2)/min]-euglycemic clamp), first-phase insulin and second-phase insulin secretion (2-h hyperglycemic clamp), body composition, and abdominal adiposity. Glucose disposition index (GDI) was calculated as the product of first-phase insulin x insulin sensitivity. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was significantly lower in subjects with type 2 diabetes compared with subjects with NGT and IGT, with no difference between the latter two. However, compared with youth with NGT, youth with IGT have significantly lower first-phase insulin and C-peptide levels and GDI (P = 0.012), whereas youth with type 2 diabetes have an additional defect in second-phase insulin. Fasting and 2-h glucose correlated with GDI (r = -0.68, P < 0.001 and r = -0.73, P < 0.001, respectively) and first-phase insulin but not with insulin sensitivity. Compared with youth with NGT, obese adolescents with IGT have evidence of a beta-cell defect manifested in impaired first-phase insulin secretion, with a more profound defect in type 2 diabetes involving both first- and second-phase insulin. GDI shows a significantly declining pattern: it is highest in NGT, intermediate in IGT, and lowest in type 2 diabetes. Such data suggest that measures to prevent progression or conversion from pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes should target improvement in beta-cell function.
3 The distinctive profile of risk factors of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in comparison with other head and neck cancer types. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and other head and neck cancer (HNCA) types show a great epidemiological variation in different regions of the world. NPC has multifactorial etiology and many interacting risk factors are involved in NPC development mainly Epstein Barr virus (EBV). There is a need to scrutinize the complicated network of risk factors affecting NPC and how far they are different from that of other HNCA types. 122 HNCA patients and 100 control subjects were studied in the region of the Middle East. Three types of HNCA were involved in our study, NPC, carcinoma of larynx (CL), and hypopharyngeal carcinoma (HPC). The risk factors studied were the level of EBV serum IgG and IgA antibodies measured by ELISA, age, sex, smoking, alcohol intake, histology, and family history of the disease. EBV serum level of IgG and IgA antibodies was higher in NPC than CL, HPC, and control groups (p < 0.01). NPC was associated with lymphoepithelioma (LE) tumors, males, regular alcohol intake, and regular smoking while CL and HPC were not (p < 0.05). CL and HPC were associated with SCC tumors (p < 0.05). Furthermore, NPC, unlike CL and HPC groups, was not affected by the positive family history of HNCA (p > 0.05). The serum levels of EBV IgG and IgA antibodies were higher in LE tumors, regular smokers, younger patients, and negative family history groups of NPC patients than SCC tumors, non-regular smokers, older patients and positive family history groups respectively (p < 0.05) while this was not found in the regular alcoholics (p > 0.05). It was concluded that risk factors of NPC deviate much from that of other HNCA. EBV, smoking, alcohol intake, LE tumors, male patient, and age > 54 years were hot risk factors of NPC while SCC and positive family history of the disease were not. Earlier incidence, smoking, LE tumors, and negative family history of the disease in NPC patients were associated much clearly with EBV. It is proposed that determining the correct risk factors of NPC is vital in assigning the correct risk groups of NPC which helps the early detection and screening of NPC.
0 Scanning the genome for gene single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in adaptive population differentiation in white spruce. Conifers are characterized by a large genome size and a rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium, most often within gene limits. Genome scans based on noncoding markers are less likely to detect molecular adaptation linked to genes in these species. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scan focused on expressed genes in detecting local adaptation in a conifer species. Samples were collected from six natural populations of white spruce (Picea glauca) moderately differentiated for several quantitative characters. A total of 534 SNPs representing 345 expressed genes were analysed. Genes potentially under natural selection were identified by estimating the differentiation in SNP frequencies among populations (F(ST)) and identifying outliers, and by estimating local differentiation using a Bayesian approach. Both average expected heterozygosity and population differentiation estimates (H(E) = 0.270 and F(ST) = 0.006) were comparable to those obtained with other genetic markers. Of all genes, 5.5% were identified as outliers with F(ST) at the 95% confidence level, while 14% were identified as candidates for local adaptation with the Bayesian method. There was some overlap between the two gene sets. More than half of the candidate genes for local adaptation were specific to the warmest population, about 20% to the most arid population, and 15% to the coldest and most humid higher altitude population. These adaptive trends were consistent with the genes' putative functions and the divergence in quantitative traits noted among the populations. The results suggest that an approach separating the locus and population effects is useful to identify genes potentially under selection. These candidates are worth exploring in more details at the physiological and ecological levels.
0 Analysis of chromatin boundary activity in Drosophila cells. Chromatin boundaries, also known as insulators, regulate gene activity by organizing active and repressive chromatin domains and modulate enhancer-promoter interactions. However, the mechanisms of boundary action are poorly understood, in part due to our limited knowledge about insulator proteins, and a shortage of standard assays by which diverse boundaries could be compared. We report here the development of an enhancer-blocking assay for studying insulator activity in Drosophila cultured cells. We show that the activities of diverse Drosophila insulators including suHw, SF1, SF1b, Fab7 and Fab8 are supported in these cells. We further show that double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated knockdown of SuHw and dCTCF factors disrupts the enhancer-blocking function of suHw and Fab8, respectively, thereby establishing the effectiveness of using RNA interference in our cell-based assay for probing insulator function. The novel boundary assay provides a quantitative and efficient method for analyzing insulator mechanism and can be further exploited in genome-wide RNAi screens for insulator components. It provides a useful tool that complements the transgenic and genetic approaches for studying this important class of regulatory elements.
0 Effect of sirolimus on urinary bladder cancer T24 cell line. Sirolimus is recently reported to have antitumour effects on a large variety of cancers. The present study was performed to investigate sirolimus's ability to inhibit growth in T24 bladder cancer cells. T24 bladder cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of sirolimus. MTT assay was used to evaluate the proliferation inhibitory effect on T24 cell line. The viability of T24 cell line was determined by Trypan blue exclusion analysis. Sirolimus inhibits the growth of bladder carcinoma cells and decreases their viability. Significant correlations were found between cell proliferation and sirolimus concentration (r = 0.830; p < 0.01) as well as between cell viability and sirolimus concentration (r = -0.896; p < 0.01). Sirolimus has an anti-proliferation effect on the T24 bladder carcinoma cell line. The information from our results is useful for a better understanding sirolimus's anti-proliferative activity in the T24 bladder cancer cell line.
3 Squamous metaplasia and BCL-6 in pediatric adenoid accompanied by otitis media with effusion. Deterioration of local immunity in the adenoids may make them vulnerable to infection by microorganisms, resulting in otitis media with effusion. To determine the factors associated with this condition, we evaluated adenoid size, mucosal barrier, squamous changes of ciliated epithelium, IgA secretion, and BCL-6 expression in adenoids. Seventeen children diagnosed with otitis media with effusion (OME group) and 20 children without any history of OME (control group) were enrolled. Their adenoids were sized by lateral view X-ray and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to detect squamous metaplasia. The adenoids were also stained with cytokeratin to evaluate mucosal barriers, and with anti- IgA antibody and anti- BCL-6 antibody to determine expression of IgA and BCL-6. The OME group showed greater incidence of squamous metaplasia, fewer ciliated cells, and lower expression of BCL-6 (p < 0.05 each). Deterioration of the mucosal barrier was detected in the OME group (p > 0.05). IgA secretion and adenoid size were the same for the OME and the control groups. These results suggest that increased squamous metaplasia and lower BCL-6 expression in adenoids may be associated with increased susceptibility to OME.
2 Current antimicrobial usage for the management of neutropenic fever in Korea: a nationwide survey. A nationwide questionnaire-based survey was performed to evaluate the current clinical practices for the management of neutropenic fever in hematology units and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) centers throughout Korea. A 86.9% response rate was obtained from a total of 46 doctors and practical policies of the 33 sites were analysed. Approximately 42.4% and 84.8% of the sites responded that they used oral fluoroquinolone as prophylaxis for neutropenic patients receiving chemotherapy and HSCT, respectively. Additionally, 42.4% of the sites responded that they used antifungal prophylaxis in the chemotherapy groups whereas 90.9% of the sites responded that they used antifungal prophylaxis in HSCT recipients. Approximately half of the responding sites prescribed combination regimen with 3rd or 4th cephalosporin plus aminoglycoside as a first-line therapy. Most of the sites considered persistent fever for 2-4 days or aggravated clinical symptoms for 1-2 days as failure of the first-line regimen, and they changed antibiotics to second-line regimens that varied widely among the sites. Twenty-seven sites (84.4%) responded that they considered adding an antifungal agent when fever persisted for 5-7 days despite antibacterial therapy. Amphotericin B deoxycholate was preferred as a first-line antifungal, which was probably due to the limitations of the national health insurance system. The role of oral antibiotics in the management of neutropenic fever still accounted for a small portion. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first report to examine the practical policies currently in place for the management of neutropenic fever in Korea and the results of this survey may help to establish a Korean guideline in the future.
1 The assessment of health-related quality of life in relation to the body mass index value in the urban population of Belgrade. The association between excess body weight, impairment of health and different co-morbidities is well recognized; however, little is known on how excess body weight may affect the quality of life in the general population. Our study investigates the relationship between perceived health-related quality of life (HRQL) and body mass index (BMI) in the urban population of Belgrade. The research was conducted during 2005 on a sample of 5,000 subjects, with a response of 63.38%. The study sample was randomly selected and included men and women over 18 years of age, who resided at the same address over a period of 10 years. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire and nutritional status was categorized using the WHO classification. HRQL was measured using the SF-36 generic score. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare HRQL between subjects with normal weight and those with different BMI values; we monitored subject characteristics and potential co-morbidity. The prevalence of overweight males and females was 46.6% and 22.1%, respectively. The prevalence of obesity was 7.5% in males and 8.5% in females.All aspects of health, except mental, were impaired in males who were obese. The physical and mental wellbeing of overweight males was not significantly affected; all score values were similar to those in subjects with normal weight.By contrast, obese and overweight females had lower HRQL in all aspects of physical functioning, as well as in vitality, social functioning and role-emotional. The results of our study show that, in the urban population of Belgrade, increased BMI has a much greater impact on physical rather than on mental health, irrespective of subject gender; the effects were particularly pronounced in obese individuals.
3 Endovascular stent-graft treatment of a traumatic vertebral artery pseudoaneurysm and vertebrojugular fistula. An endovascular intervention is a feasible alternative to the technically challenging conventional surgery for the treatment of traumatic vertebral arterial lesions. This report describes a rare case involving a 22-year-old patient with a traumatic vertebral arterial pseudoaneurysm and multiple arteriovenous fistulas which were successfully sealed using the endovascular stent-graft technique.
1 In utero development of the fetal gall bladder in the Korean population. To provide reference ranges of the fetal gall bladder in the Korean population. Fetal gall bladder development was evaluated in well-dated, non-anomalous fetuses in the Korean population between February and April 2003 and the visualization rate and reference values were determined from the obtained data. The visualization rate of the fetal gall bladder increased as gestation advanced to a plateau above 90%, which was maintained between 16 and 34 weeks. The measured parameters from the fetal gall bladder had a significant positive relationship with gestational age (p = 0.000 for all cases), and the correlation of length and area with the gestational age (r = 0.741 and r = 0.690, respectively) was better than the correlation of width, height, and volume with gestational age. The repeatability coefficients and coefficients of variation between the two operators were 5.56 mm and 12.9% for the length and 344.11 mm(2) and 33.52% for the area. The median length of the fetal gall bladder in the Korean population was not significantly different from the mean length of gall bladders in the Caucasian and African-American populations (p = 0.915). We have provided reference values for the fetal gall bladder throughout the gestation period in the Korean population.
0 Anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome associated with Epstein-Barr virus reactivation. We describe a 59-year-old female with severe anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) associated with Epstein- Barr virus (EBV) infection. The causative drug was speculated to be carbamazepine. Recurrent EBV infection was demonstrated by the presence of anti-EBV early antigen IgM antibodies and anti-EBV nuclear antigen IgG antibodies. To our knowledge, only one case of drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS) associated with EBV has been reported in the English- language literature. Our case is the second report of EBV-associated DHS, which suggests that EBV infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of AHS in a few patients.
0 A role for the unfolded protein response (UPR) in virulence and antifungal susceptibility in Aspergillus fumigatus. Filamentous fungi rely heavily on the secretory pathway, both for the delivery of cell wall components to the hyphal tip and the production and secretion of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes needed to support growth on polymeric substrates. Increased demand on the secretory system exerts stress on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is countered by the activation of a coordinated stress response pathway termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). To determine the contribution of the UPR to the growth and virulence of the filamentous fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, we disrupted the hacA gene, encoding the major transcriptional regulator of the UPR. The DeltahacA mutant was unable to activate the UPR in response to ER stress and was hypersensitive to agents that disrupt ER homeostasis or the cell wall. Failure to induce the UPR did not affect radial growth on rich medium at 37 degrees C, but cell wall integrity was disrupted at 45 degrees C, resulting in a dramatic loss in viability. The DeltahacA mutant displayed a reduced capacity for protease secretion and was growth-impaired when challenged to assimilate nutrients from complex substrates. In addition, the DeltahacA mutant exhibited increased susceptibility to current antifungal agents that disrupt the membrane or cell wall and had attenuated virulence in multiple mouse models of invasive aspergillosis. These results demonstrate the importance of ER homeostasis to the growth and virulence of A. fumigatus and suggest that targeting the UPR, either alone or in combination with other antifungal drugs, would be an effective antifungal strategy.
3 Comparative study of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection due to genotypes 1 and 3 referred for treatment in southeast Brazil. The progression of liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is influenced by host and viral factors. Distinct clinical outcomes in patients infected with different HCV genotypes have been described in the literature. However, the association between specific HCV genotype and clinical outcome remains unclear. We set out to study the natural history of HCV genotype 1 and 3 infections in Campinas, São Paulo state, Brazil, focusing on epidemiological, clinical, biochemical, and histological characteristics. Patients with HCV infection referred for treatment between January 2003 and December 2006 were included in this study. We collected epidemiological, clinical, and laboratorial data using standard forms. A total of 283 patients were included; genotype 1 was identified in 163 (57.6%) patients, genotype 3 in 112 (39.6%), genotype 2 in 7 (2.5%), and genotype 4 in 1 (0.35%). Patients with genotype 2 and 4 were excluded from analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that intravenous energetic drug, positive cryoglobulin, and cirrhosis were independently and significantly associated with HCV genotype 3 (p < 0.05). Genotype 3 currently seems to be associated with intravenous energetic drug, high frequency of cryoglobulinemia, and advanced liver disease in our region. Understanding the distribution of the different HCV genotypes can elucidate transmission of HCV and support optimal prevention strategies.
3 Morphine exacerbates HIV-1 Tat-induced cytokine production in astrocytes through convergent effects on [Ca(2+)](i), NF-kappaB trafficking and transcription. Astroglia are key cellular sites where opiate drug signals converge with the proinflammatory effects of HIV-1 Tat signals to exacerbate HIV encephalitis. Despite this understanding, the molecular sites of convergence driving opiate-accelerated neuropathogenesis have not been deciphered. We therefore explored potential points of interaction between the signaling pathways initiated by HIV-1 Tat and opioids in striatal astrocytes. Profiling studies screening 152 transcription factors indicated that the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) subunit, c-Rel, was a likely candidate for Tat or Tat plus opiate-induced increases in cytokine and chemokine production by astrocytes. Pretreatment with the NF-kappaB inhibitor parthenolide provided evidence that Tat+/-morphine-induced release of MCP-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by astrocytes is NF-kappaB dependent. The nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B, blocked the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NF-kappaB; causing p65 (RelA) accumulation in the nucleus, and significantly attenuated cytokine production in Tat+/-morphine exposed astrocytes. Similarly, chelating intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) blocked Tat+/-morphine-evoked MCP-1 and IL-6 release, while artificially increasing the concentration of extracellular Ca(2+) reversed this effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate that: 1) exposure to Tat+/-morphine is sufficient to activate NF-kappaB and cytokine production, 2) the release of MCP-1 and IL-6 by Tat+/-morphine are highly Ca(2+)-dependent, while TNF-alpha appears to be less affected by the changes in [Ca(2+)](i), and 3) in the presence of Tat, exposure to opiates augments Tat-induced NF-kappaB activation and cytokine release through a Ca(2+)-dependent pathway.
1 Free-living physical activity energy expenditure is strongly related to glucose intolerance in Cameroonian adults independently of obesity. We examined the cross-sectional association between objectively measured free-living physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and glucose tolerance in adult Cameroonians without known diabetes. PAEE was measured in 34 volunteers using the doubly labeled water method and indirect calorimetry (resting). Fasting blood glucose and 2-h postload blood glucose were measured during a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. There was a significant negative correlation between PAEE and 2-h glucose (r = -0.43; P = 0.01) but not fasting glucose (r = 0.1; P = 0.57). The inverse association between PAEE and 2-h glucose remained after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI (beta = -0.017 [95% CI -0.033 to -0.002]) and was unchanged after further adjustment for waist circumference, body fat percentage, or aerobic fitness. PAEE is inversely associated with 2-h glucose independently of adiposity or fitness. Interventions aimed at increasing PAEE could play an important role in diabetes prevention in developing countries.
3 Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are proportionally expanded at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and enhance islet autoantigen presentation to T-cells through immune complex capture. Immune-mediated destruction of beta-cells resulting in type 1 diabetes involves activation of proinflammatory, islet autoreactive T-cells, a process under the control of dendritic cells of the innate immune system. We tested the hypothesis that type 1 diabetes development is associated with disturbance of blood dendritic cell subsets that could enhance islet-specific autoimmunity. We examined blood dendritic cells (plasmacytoid and myeloid) in 40 patients with recent-onset diabetes (median duration 28 days) and matched control subjects. We also examined the relative ability of different dendritic cell subsets to process and present soluble or immune complexed islet cell autoantigen (the islet tyrosine phosphatase IA-2) to responder CD4 T-cells. The balance of blood dendritic cells was profoundly disturbed at diabetes diagnosis, with a significantly elevated proportion of plasmacytoid and reduction of myeloid cells compared with control subjects. Dendritic cell subset distribution was normal in long-standing disease and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Both dendritic cell subsets processed and presented soluble IA-2 to CD4 T-cells after short-term culture, but only plasmacytoid dendritic cells enhanced (by as much as 100%) autoantigen presentation in the presence of IA-2(+) autoantibody patient serum. The plasmacytoid subset of dendritic cells is overrepresented in the blood close to diabetes onset and shows a distinctive ability to capture islet autoantigenic immune complexes and enhance autoantigen-driven CD4 T-cell activation. This suggests a synergistic proinflammatory role for plasmacytoid dendritic cells and islet cell autoantibodies in type 1 diabetes.
1 A new method for investigation of the hair shaft: hard X-ray microscopy with a 90-nm spatial resolution. Various methods have been used to investigate the hair shaft. In the ultrastructural hair field, scanning and transmission electron microscopies are widely used investigative methods, but they have some technical limitations. Recently, X-ray microscopes with sub-micron spatial resolution have emerged as useful instruments because they offer a unique opportunity to observe the interior of an undamaged sample in greater detail. In this report, we examined damaged hair shaft tips using hard X-ray microscopy with a 90 nm spatial resolution. The results of this study suggest that hard X-ray microscopy is an alternative investigative method for hair morphology studies.
1 Characterization of a novel polymorphism in PPARG regulatory region associated with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy in Italy. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma polymorphisms have been widely associated with type 2 diabetes, although their role in the pathogenesis of vascular complications is not yet demonstrated. In this study, a cohort of 211 type 2 diabetes, 205 obese, and 254 control individuals was genotyped for Pro12Ala, C1431T, C-2821T polymorphisms, and for a newly identified polymorphism (A-2819G). The above-mentioned polymorphisms were analyzed by gene-specific PCR and direct sequencing of all samples. A significant difference was found for -2819G frequency when patients with type 2 diabetes-particularly diabetic women with the proliferative retinopathy-were compared with healthy control individuals. In conclusion, we identified a novel polymorphism, A-2819G, in PPARG gene, and we found it to be associated with type 2 diabetes and proliferative retinopathy in diabetic females. In the analyzed population, this variant represents a genetic risk factor for developing the diabetic retinopathy, whereas Pro12Ala and C1431T do not.
0 Identification of precursor transcripts for 6 novel miRNAs expands the diversity on the genomic organisation and expression of miRNA genes in rice. The plant miRNAs represent an important class of endogenous small RNAs that guide cleavage of an mRNA target or repress its translation to control development and adaptation to stresses. MiRNAs are nuclear-encoded genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, producing a primary precursor that is subsequently processed by DCL1 an RNase III Dicer-like protein. In rice hundreds of miRNAs have been described or predicted, but little is known on their genes and precursors which are important criteria to distinguish them from siRNAs. Here we develop a combination of experimental approaches to detect novel miRNAs in rice, identify their precursor transcripts and genes and predict or validate their mRNA targets. We produced four cDNA libraries from small RNA fractions extracted from distinct rice tissues. By in silico analysis we selected 6 potential novel miRNAs, and confirmed that their expression requires OsDCL1. We predicted their targets and used 5'RACE to validate cleavage for three of them, targeting a PPR, an SPX domain protein and a GT-like transcription factor respectively. In addition, we identified precursor transcripts for the 6 miRNAs expressed in rice, showing that these precursors can be efficiently processed using a transient expression assay in transfected Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Most interestingly, we describe two precursors producing tandem miRNAs, but in distinct arrays. We focus on one of them encoding osa-miR159a.2, a novel miRNA produced from the same stem-loop structure encoding the conserved osa-miR159a.1. We show that this dual osa-miR159a.2-osa-miR159a.1 structure is conserved in distant rice species and maize. Finally we show that the predicted mRNA target of osa-miR159a.2 encoding a GT-like transcription factor is cleaved in vivo at the expected site. The combination of approaches developed here identified six novel miRNAs expressed in rice which can be clearly distinguished from siRNAs. Importantly, we show that two miRNAs can be produced from a single precursor, either from tandem stem-loops or tandemly arrayed in a single stem-loop. This suggests that processing of these precursors could be an important regulatory step to produce one or more functional miRNAs in plants and perhaps coordinate cleavage of distinct targets in the same plant tissue.
1 Dark-room prone-position test for intermittent angle closure. To determine the efficacy and safety of the dark-room prone-position test (DRPT) for intermittent angle closure (IAC) and to investigate the correlation between A-scan ultrasound biometric measurements and the results of DRPT. Medical records were reviewed of 37 eyes in 24 patients who were diagnosed with IAC and received DRPT. The increase of intraocular pressure (IOP) induced by DRPT and the results from A-scan ultrasound biometric measurements were obtained. An increase in IOP of at least 8 mmHg from baseline was considered a positive result for DRPT. Associations between the increase of IOP induced by DRPT and the parameters of A-scan biometry were tested by linear regression analysis. The DRPT results were positive in 28 eyes of 19 patients. After DRPT, the IOP returned to near-baseline levels within 2 hours in all patients; some patients were treated with anti-glaucoma eye drops. Lens thickness was significantly correlated with the amount of IOP elevation induced by DRPT (r=0.338, p=0.041). DRPT is a safe and effective test in patients with IAC. DRPT can be used effectively to make a concrete diagnosis of IAC. Lens thickness appears to be associated with a positive response to DRPT.
0 Involvement of the TPR2 subdomain movement in the activities of phi29 DNA polymerase. The polymerization domain of phi29 DNA polymerase acquires a toroidal shape by means of an arch-like structure formed by the specific insertion TPR2 (Terminal Protein Region 2) and the thumb subdomain. TPR2 is connected to the fingers and palm subdomains through flexible regions, suggesting that it can undergo conformational changes. To examine whether such changes take place, we have constructed a phi29 DNA polymerase mutant able to form a disulfide bond between the apexes of TPR2 and thumb to limit the mobility of TPR2. Biochemical analysis of the mutant led us to conclude that TPR2 moves away from the thumb to allow the DNA polymerase to replicate circular ssDNA. Despite the fact that no TPR2 motion is needed to allow the polymerase to use the terminal protein (TP) as primer during the initiation of phi29 TP-DNA replication, the disulfide bond prevents the DNA polymerase from entering the elongation phase, suggesting that TPR2 movements are necessary to allow the TP priming domain to move out from the polymerase during transition from initiation to elongation. Furthermore, the TPR2-thumb bond does not affect the equilibrium between the polymerization and exonuclease activities, leading us to propose a primer-terminus transference model between both active sites.
3 An essential role of the universal polarity protein, aPKClambda, on the maintenance of podocyte slit diaphragms. Glomerular visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) contain interdigitated processes that form specialized intercellular junctions, termed slit diaphragms, which provide a selective filtration barrier in the renal glomerulus. Analyses of disease-causing mutations in familial nephrotic syndromes and targeted mutagenesis in mice have revealed critical roles of several proteins in the assembly of slit diaphragms. The nephrin-podocin complex is the main constituent of slit diaphragms. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating these proteins to maintain the slit diaphragms are still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the PAR3-atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-PAR6beta cell polarity proteins co-localize to the slit diaphragms with nephrin. Furthermore, selective depletion of aPKClambda in mouse podocytes results in the disassembly of slit diaphragms, a disturbance in apico-basal cell polarity, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The aPKC-PAR3 complex associates with the nephrin-podocin complex in podocytes through direct interaction between PAR3 and nephrin, and the kinase activity of aPKC is required for the appropriate distribution of nephrin and podocin in podocytes. These observations not only establish a critical function of the polarity proteins in the maintenance of slit diaphragms, but also imply their potential involvement in renal failure in FSGS.
3 Windblown lead carbonate as the main source of lead in blood of children from a seaside community: an example of local birds as "canaries in the mine". In late 2006, the seaside community in Esperance, Western Australia, was alerted to thousands of native bird species dying. The source of the lead was thought to derive from the handling of Pb carbonate concentrate from the Magellan mine through the port of Esperance, begun in July 2005. Concern was expressed for the impact of this process on the community. This study was designed to evaluate the source of Pb in blood of a random sample of the community using Pb isotope ratios. The cohort comprised 49 children (48 < 5 years of age) along with 18 adults (> 20 years of age) with a bias toward higher blood lead (PbB) values to facilitate source identification. Mean PbB level of the children was 7.5 microg/dL (range, 1.5-25.7 microg/dL; n = 49; geometric mean, 6.6 microg/dL), with four children whose PbB was > 12 microg/dL. The isotopic data for blood samples lay around two distinct arrays. The blood of all children analyzed for Pb isotopes contained a contribution of Pb from the Magellan mine, which for young children ranged from 27% up to 93% (mean, 64%; median, 71%). Subtraction of the ore component gave a mean background PbB of 2.3 mug/dL. Several children whose PbB was > 9 microg/dL and most of the older subjects have complex sources of Pb. The death of the birds acted as a sentinel event; otherwise, the exposure of the community, arising from such a toxic form of Pb, could have been tragic. Isotopic data and mineralogic and particle size analyses indicate that, apart from the recognized pathway of Pb exposure by hand-to-mouth activity in children, the inhalation pathway could have been a significant contributor to PbB for some of the very young children and in some parents.
1 Maintenance of improved lipid levels following attendance at a cardiovascular risk reduction clinic: a 10-year experience. Specialty cardiovascular risk reduction clinics (CRRC) increase the proportion of patients attaining recommended lipid targets; however, it is not known if the benefits are sustained after discharge. We evaluated the impact of a CRRC on lipid levels and assessed the long-term effect of a CRRC in maintaining improved lipid levels following discharge. The medical records of consecutive dyslipidemic patients discharged > 6 months from a tertiary hospital CRRC from January 1991 to January 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcome was the change in patients' lipid levels between the final CRRC visit and the most recent primary care follow-up. A worst-case analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential impact of the patients in whom the follow-up lipid profiles post-discharge from the CRRC were not obtained. Within the CRRC (median follow-up = 1.28 years in 1064 patients), we observed statistically significant improvements in all lipid parameters. In the 411 patients for whom post-discharge lipid profiles were available (median follow-up = 2.41 years), there were no significant differences observed in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), or triglycerides since CRRC discharge; however, there were small improvements in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and TC:HDL ratio (p < 0.05 for both). The unadjusted worst-case analysis (653 patients with no follow-up lipid profiles) demonstrated statistically significant worsening of all lipid parameters between CRRC discharge and the most recent follow-up. However, when the change in lipid parameters between the baseline and the most recent follow-up was assessed in this analysis, the changes in all lipid parameters were significantly improved (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that a CRRC can improve lipid levels and suggests that these benefits are sustained once patients are returned to the care of their primary physician.
0 Derangement of a factor upstream of RARalpha triggers the repression of a pleiotropic epigenetic network. Chromatin adapts and responds to extrinsic and intrinsic cues. We hypothesize that inheritable aberrant chromatin states in cancer and aging are caused by genetic/environmental factors. In previous studies we demonstrated that either genetic mutations, or loss, of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), can impair the integration of the retinoic acid (RA) signal at the chromatin of RA-responsive genes downstream of RARalpha, and can lead to aberrant repressive chromatin states marked by epigenetic modifications. In this study we tested whether the mere interference with the availability of RA signal at RARalpha, in cells with an otherwise functional RARalpha, can also induce epigenetic repression at RA-responsive genes downstream of RARalpha. To hamper the availability of RA at RARalpha in untransformed human mammary epithelial cells, we targeted the cellular RA-binding protein 2 (CRABP2), which transports RA from the cytoplasm onto the nuclear RARs. Stable ectopic expression of a CRABP2 mutant unable to enter the nucleus, as well as stable knock down of endogenous CRABP2, led to the coordinated transcriptional repression of a few RA-responsive genes downstream of RARalpha. The chromatin at these genes acquired an exacerbated repressed state, or state "of no return". This aberrant state is unresponsive to RA, and therefore differs from the physiologically repressed, yet "poised" state, which is responsive to RA. Consistent with development of homozygosis for epigenetically repressed loci, a significant proportion of cells with a defective CRABP2-mediated RA transport developed heritable phenotypes indicative of loss of function. Derangement/lack of a critical factor necessary for RARalpha function induces epigenetic repression of a RA-regulated gene network downstream of RARalpha, with major pleiotropic biological outcomes.
0 Functional anergy in a subpopulation of naive B cells from healthy humans that express autoreactive immunoglobulin receptors. Self-reactive B cells not controlled by receptor editing or clonal deletion may become anergic. We report that fully mature human B cells negative for surface IgM and retaining only IgD are autoreactive and functionally attenuated (referred to as naive IgD(+)IgM(-) B cells [B(ND)]). These B(ND) cells typically make up 2.5% of B cells in the peripheral blood, have antibody variable region genes in germline (unmutated) configuration, and, by all current measures, are fully mature. Analysis of 95 recombinant antibodies expressed from the variable genes of single B(ND) cells demonstrated that they are predominantly autoreactive, binding to HEp-2 cell antigens and DNA. Upon B cell receptor cross-linkage, B(ND) cells have a reduced capacity to mobilize intracellular calcium or phosphorylate tyrosines, demonstrating that they are anergic. However, intense stimulation causes B(ND) cells to fully respond, suggesting that these cells could be the precursors of autoantibody secreting plasma cells in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. This is the first identification of a distinct mature human B cell subset that is naturally autoreactive and controlled by the tolerizing mechanism of functional anergy.
1 Reliability and validity of the Korean version of Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised in a non-clinical sample. The reliability and validity of a Korean version of the Obsessive-Compulsive-Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) was examined in non-clinical student samples. The Korean version of OCI-R was administered to a total of 228 Korean college students. The Maudsley Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (MOCI), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were administered to 228 students. The total and each of subscale of the Korean OCI-R demonstrated excellent internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, moderate convergent validity and good divergent validity. It was concluded that the Korean version of the OCI-R has strong psychometric properties as the original version.
0 Novel human rhinoviruses and exacerbation of asthma in children. To determine links between human rhinoviruses (HRV) and asthma, we used data from a case-control study, March 2003-February 2004, among children with asthma. Molecular characterization identified several likely new HRVs and showed that association with asthma exacerbations was largely driven by HRV-A and a phylogenetically distinct clade of 8 strains, genogroup C.
2 Long-term oxygen therapy: are we prescribing appropriately? Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is the treatment proven to improve survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with chronic respiratory failure. It also appears to reduce the number of hospitalizations, increase effort capacity, and improve health-related quality of life. Standard LTOT criteria are related to COPD patients who have PaO2 < 60 mmHg, are in a clinical stable situation, and are receiving optimal pharmacological treatment. According to LTOT guidelines, oxygen should be prescribed for at least 18 hours per day although some authors consider 24 hours would be more beneficial. The benefits of LTOT depend on correction of hypoxemia. Arterial blood gases should be measured at rest. During exercise, an effort test should be done to assure adequate SaO2. During sleep, continuous monitoring of SaO2 and PaCO2 should be performed to confirm correction of SaO2 overnight. An arterial blood gas sample should be taken at awakening to assess PaCO, in order to prevent hypoventilation from the oxygen therapy. Several issues that need to be addressed are the use of LTOT in COPD patients with moderate hypoxemia, the efficacy of LTOT in patients who desaturate during exercise or during sleep, the optimal dosage of oxygen supplementation, LTOT compliance, and the LTOT prescription in diseases other than COPD.
1 A case of noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium combined with situs ambiguous with polysplenia. A 33-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with chest pain and exertional dyspnea. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses, findings consistent with noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium. Thoracoabdominal CT and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) revealed situs ambiguous with polysplenia and noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium. CMR also demonstrated delayed enhancement of the trabeculations located at the apical portion of the left ventricle. The coronary angiogram was normal. This is the first case of noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium associated with situs ambiguous with polysplenia.
0 Giant multilocular prostatic cystadenoma presenting with obstructive aspermia. Giant multilocular prostatic cystadenoma (GMPC) is a rare benign tumor involving the prostate gland. Microscopically, it masquerades phyllodes tumor or transitional zone hyperplasia. We report one case of GMPC arising from the prostate central zone (CZ), presenting with long-standing aspermia associated with seminal vesicle fibrous obliteration.
3 Herpes simplex virus type 1 Us3 gene deletion influences toll-like receptor responses in cultured monocytic cells. Toll-like receptors have a key role in innate immune response to microbial infection. The toll-like receptor (TLR) family consists of ten identified human TLRs, of which TLR2 and TLR9 have been shown to initiate innate responses to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and TLR3 has been shown to be involved in defence against severe HSV-1 infections of the central nervous system. However, no significant activation of the TLR3 pathways has been observed in wild type HSV-1 infections. In this work, we have studied the TLR responses and effects on TLR gene expression by HSV-1 with Us3 and ICP4 gene deletions, which also subject infected cells to apoptosis in human monocytic (U937) cell cultures. U937 human monocytic cells were infected with the Us3 and ICP4 deletion herpes simplex virus (d120), its parental virus HSV-1 (KOS), the Us3 deletion virus (R7041), its rescue virus (R7306) or wild type HSV-1 (F). The mRNA expression of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR9 and type I interferons (IFN) were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The intracellular expression of TLR3 and type I IFN inducible myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) protein as well as the level of apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. We observed that the mRNA expression of TLR3 and type I IFNs were significantly increased in d120, R7041 and HSV-1 (F)-infected U937 cells. Moreover, the intracellular expression of TLR3 and MxA were significantly increased in d120 and R7041-infected cells. We observed activation of IRF-3 in infections with d120 and R7041. The TLR4 mRNA expression level was significantly decreased in d120 and R7041-infected cells but increased in HSV-1 (KOS)-infected cells in comparison with uninfected cells. No significant difference in TLR2 or TLR9 mRNA expression levels was seen. Both the R7041 and d120 viruses were able to induce apoptosis in U937 cell cultures. The levels of TLR3 and type I IFN mRNA were increased in d120, R7041 and HSV-1 (F)-infected cells when compared with uninfected cells. Also IRF-3 was activated in cells infected with the Us3 gene deletion viruses d120 and R7041. This is consistent with activation of TLR3 signaling in the cells. The intracellular TLR3 and type I IFN inducible MxA protein levels were increased in d120 and R7041-infected cells but not in cells infected with the corresponding parental or rescue viruses, suggesting that the HSV-1 Us3 gene is involved in control of TLR3 responses in U937 cells.
3 Multiple gene polymorphisms analysis revealed a different profile of genetic polymorphisms of primary open-angle glaucoma in northern Chinese. To evaluate the individual and interactive effects of polymorphisms in the myocilin (MYOC),optineurin (OPTN), WD repeat domain 36 (WDR36), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes on primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in northern Chinese. Northern Chinese study subjects, 176 POAG patients and 200 controls, were recruited for screening of the coding exons and splicing regions of MYOC. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in OPTN (M98K, R545Q, IVS5+38T>G, IVS8-53T>C, and IVS15+10G>A), one SNP in WDR36 (IVS5+30C>T) as well as the APOE promoter and epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphisms were also examined. Association analysis was performed by using chi(2) analysis. High-order gene-gene interaction was also analyzed using the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. In MYOC, 22 variants were identified. Four of them were novel but found in controls only. The missense mutation, Val53Ala, is likely a glaucoma causing mutation, accounting for 0.6% of cases. No individual polymorphism in OPTN, WDR36, or APOE was associated with POAG. MDR analysis identified a best 6-factor model for POAG: MYOC IVS2+35A>G, OPTN Met98Lys, OPTN IVS5+38T>G, OPTN IVS8-53T>C, WDR36 IVS5+30C>T, and APOE -491A>T. The association pattern between the genes, MYOC, OPTN, WDR36, and APOE, and POAG in northern Chinese is different from that of southern Chinese. Disease-causing mutations in MYOC accounted for a small proportion of northern Chinese POAG patients. Common polymorphisms in these genes were not associated with POAG individually but might interactively contribute to the disorder, supporting a polygenic etiology.
3 First report of Q fever in Oman. Although serologic evidence suggests the presence of Q fever in humans and animals in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, acute Q fever has not been reported on the Arabian Peninsula. We report the first two cases of acute Q fever in Oman.
0 Genetic variation on chromosome 6 influences F cell levels in healthy individuals of African descent and HbF levels in sickle cell patients. Fetal haemoglobin (HbF) is a major ameliorating factor in sickle cell disease. We investigated if a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 6q23 was significantly associated with HbF and F cell levels in individuals of African descent. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 24-kb intergenic region, 33-kb upstream of the HBS1L gene and 80-kb upstream of the MYB gene, were typed in 177 healthy Afro-Caribbean subjects (AC) of approximately 7% European admixture, 631 healthy Afro-Germans (AG, a group of African and German descendents located in rural Jamaica with about 20% European admixture), 87 West African and Afro-Caribbean individuals with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS), as well as 75 Northern Europeans, which served as a contrasting population. Association with a tag SNP for the locus was detected in all four groups (AC, P = 0.005, AG, P = 0.002, HbSS patients, P = 0.019, Europeans, P = 1.5 x 10(-7)). The association signal varied across the interval in the African-descended groups, while it is more uniform in Europeans. The 6q QTL for HbF traits is present in populations of African origin and is also acting in sickle cell anaemia patients. We have started to distinguish effects originating from European and African ancestral populations in our admixed study populations.
0 Comparison of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay efficiency in various murine tissues. The Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) pathway detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons, thereby preventing the accumulation of potentially detrimental truncated proteins. Intertissue variation in the efficiency of this mechanism has been suggested, which could have important implications for the understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations in various genetic disorders. However, compelling evidence in favour of this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we have explored this question by measuring the ratio of mutant versus wild-type Men1 transcripts in thirteen tissues from mice carrying a heterozygous truncating mutation in the ubiquitously expressed Men1 gene. Significant differences were found between two groups of tissues. The first group, which includes testis, ovary, brain and heart, displays a strong decrease of the nonsense transcript (average ratio of 18% of mutant versus wild-type Men1 transcripts, identical to the value measured in murine embryonic fibroblasts). The second group, comprising lung, intestine and thymus, shows much less pronounced NMD (average ratio of 35%). Importantly, the extent of degradation by NMD does not correlate with the expression level of eleven genes encoding proteins involved in NMD or with the expression level of the Men1 gene. Mouse models are an attractive option to evaluate the efficiency of NMD in multiple mammalian tissues and organs, given that it is much easier to obtain these from a mouse than from a single individual carrying a germline truncating mutation. In this study, we have uncovered in the thirteen different murine tissues that we examined up to a two-fold difference in NMD efficiency.
3 "The English disease" or "Asian rickets"? Medical responses to postcolonial immigration. Do the former colonizing powers, like their former colonies, have "postcolonial medicine," and if so, where does it take place, who practices it, and upon whom? How has British medicine in particular responded to the huge cultural shifts represented by the rise of the New Commonwealth and associated postcolonial immigration? I address these questions through a case study of the medical and political responses to vitamin D deficiency among Britain's South Asian communities since the 1960s. My research suggests that in these contexts, diet frequently became a proxy or shorthand for culture (and religion, and race), while disease justified pressure to assimilate.
2 European guidance for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Guidance is provided in a European setting on the assessment and treatment of postmenopausal women with or at risk from osteoporosis. The European Foundation for Osteoporosis and Bone disease (subsequently the International Osteoporosis Foundation) published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in 1997. This manuscript updates these in a European setting. The following areas are reviewed: the role of bone mineral density measurement for the diagnosis of osteoporosis and assessment of fracture risk; general and pharmacological management of osteoporosis; monitoring of treatment; assessment of fracture risk; case finding strategies; investigation of patients; health economics of treatment. A platform is provided on which specific guidelines can be developed for national use.
2 Indirect optic nerve injury in two-wheeler riders in northeast India. To investigate the association of posterior indirect traumatic optic neuropathy and superior temporal orbital rim injury in two-wheeler riders and documentation of the clinical profile of such cases. Retrospective observational study. Records of all patients reporting with cranio-orbital injury and vision loss following road traffic accidents between October 1994 and April 2006 were reviewed and from them cases with vision loss solely from indirect optic nerve injury were taken up for study. The prognostic significance of different presenting features, role of intravenous methyl prednisolone (IVMP) and relative risk of superior orbital rim injury to posterior indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (at 95% confidence interval) was calculated. Out of 129 consecutive cases of cranio-orbital injury, 35 had posterior indirect traumatic optic neuropathy with minor ipsilateral superior temporal orbital rim trauma and none used any protective headwear. Presenting clinical features like relative afferent pupillary defect ( P = 0.365), optic disc status ( P = 0.518) and visual evoked potential (VEP) ( P = 0.366) were disproportionate to visual loss. Only VEP had prognostic significance. The IVMP did not provide any added therapeutic benefit. The remaining 94 cases sustained direct blinding ocular trauma and 28 of them had associated intracranial pathology. The relative risk of superior temporal orbital rim injury to posterior indirect optic nerve trauma was 2.25. Superior temporal orbital rim injury, even when minor, carries a potential risk for development of blindness from indirect posterior indirect traumatic optic neuropathy in two-wheeler drivers. Presenting signs do not correlate with visual status. Only VEP has prognostic significance and the condition is untreatable.
1 Disc hemorrhages in patients with both normal tension glaucoma and branch retinal vein occlusion in different eyes. To document the clinical features of disc hemorrhage in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and normal tension glaucoma (NTG), and to evaluate the relationship between BRVO and NTG with disc hemorrhages. From July 2001 to May 2006, sixteen patients with both NTG and BRVO in different eyes were successively collected from outpatient population of Seoul National University Hospital in this observational case series. The frequency and location of disc hemorrhages, history of associated systemic diseases, and the order of the time of diagnosis between NTG and BRVO were studied. All patients had unilateral BRVO, and their mean age was 63.3+/-10.6 years. Disc hemorrhages were detected in eight patients (50%) during the mean follow-up of 26.8 months (range, 3-96 months). Six patients (75%) had disc hemorrhages in the non-BRVO eyes and two patients (25%) in BRVO eyes. Five hemorrhages (62.5%) were located at inferior-temporal quadrant of the optic disc. History of systemic hypertension was identified in 12 patients (75.0%). In 11 patients (68.8%), NTG was diagnosed at the same time as BRVO. A higher frequency of disc hemorrhages was identified in patients with both BRVO and NTG. Therefore, some cases of NTG, especially with disc hemorrhages, may share a common vascular pathophysiology with BRVO.
1 The association between sleep duration and obesity in older adults. Reduced sleep has been reported to predict obesity in children and young adults. However, studies based on self-report have been unable to identify an association in older populations. In this study, the cross-sectional associations between sleep duration measured objectively and measures of weight and body composition were assessed in two cohorts of older adults. Wrist actigraphy was performed for a mean (s.d.) of 5.2 (0.9) nights in 3055 men (age: 67-96 years) participating in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS) and 4.1 (0.8) nights in 3052 women (age: 70-99 years) participating in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). A subgroup of 2862 men and 455 women also underwent polysomnography to measure sleep apnea severity. Compared to those sleeping an average of 7-8 h per night, and after adjusting for multiple risk factors and medical conditions, a sleep duration of less than 5 h was associated with a body mass index (BMI) that was on average 2.5 kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-2.9) greater in men and 1.8 kg/m(2) (95% CI: 1.1-2.4) greater in women. The odds of obesity (BMI >or= 30 kg/m(2)) was 3.7-fold greater (95% CI: 2.7-5.0) in men and 2.3-fold greater in women (95% CI: 1.6-3.1) who slept less than 5 h. Short sleep was also associated with central body fat distribution and increased percent body fat. These associations persisted after adjusting for sleep apnea, insomnia and daytime sleepiness. In older men and women, actigraphy-ascertained reduced sleep durations are strongly associated with greater adiposity.
3 Insecticidal genes of Yersinia spp.: taxonomical distribution, contribution to toxicity towards Manduca sexta and Galleria mellonella, and evolution. Toxin complex (Tc) proteins termed TcaABC, TcdAB, and TccABC with insecticidal activity are present in a variety of bacteria including the yersiniae. The tc gene sequences of thirteen Yersinia strains were compared, revealing a high degree of gene order conservation, but also remarkable differences with respect to pseudogenes, sequence variability and gene duplications. Outside the tc pathogenicity island (tc-PAIYe) of Y. enterocolitica strain W22703, a pseudogene (tccC2'/3') encoding proteins with homology to TccC and similarity to tyrosine phosphatases at its C-terminus was identified. PCR analysis revealed the presence of the tc-PAIYe and of tccC2'/3'-homologues in all biotype 2-5 strains tested, and their absence in most representatives of biotypes 1A and 1B. Phylogenetic analysis of 39 TccC sequences indicates the presence of the tc-PAIYe in an ancestor of Yersinia. Oral uptake experiments with Manduca sexta revealed a higher larvae lethality of Yersinia strains harbouring the tc-PAIYe in comparison to strains lacking this island. Following subcutaneous infection of Galleria mellonella larvae with five non-human pathogenic Yersinia spp. and four Y. enterocolitica strains, we observed a remarkable variability of their insecticidal activity ranging from 20% (Y. kristensenii) to 90% (Y. enterocolitica strain 2594) dead larvae after five days. Strain W22703 and its tcaA deletion mutant did not exhibit a significantly different toxicity towards G. mellonella. These data confirm a role of TcaA upon oral uptake only, and suggest the presence of further insecticidal determinants in Yersinia strains formerly unknown to kill insects. This study investigated the tc gene distribution among yersiniae and the phylogenetic relationship between TccC proteins, thus contributing novel aspects to the current discussion about the evolution of insecticidal toxins in the genus Yersinia. The toxic potential of several Yersinia spp. towards M. sexta and G. mellonella demonstrated here for the first time points to insects as a natural reservoir for yersiniae.
2 Yellow fever vaccine induces integrated multilineage and polyfunctional immune responses. Correlates of immune-mediated protection to most viral and cancer vaccines are still unknown. This impedes the development of novel vaccines to incurable diseases such as HIV and cancer. In this study, we have used functional genomics and polychromatic flow cytometry to define the signature of the immune response to the yellow fever (YF) vaccine 17D (YF17D) in a cohort of 40 volunteers followed for up to 1 yr after vaccination. We show that immunization with YF17D leads to an integrated immune response that includes several effector arms of innate immunity, including complement, the inflammasome, and interferons, as well as adaptive immunity as shown by an early T cell response followed by a brisk and variable B cell response. Development of these responses is preceded, as demonstrated in three independent vaccination trials and in a novel in vitro system of primary immune responses (modular immune in vitro construct [MIMIC] system), by the coordinated up-regulation of transcripts for specific transcription factors, including STAT1, IRF7, and ETS2, which are upstream of the different effector arms of the immune response. These results clearly show that the immune response to a strong vaccine is preceded by coordinated induction of master transcription factors that lead to the development of a broad, polyfunctional, and persistent immune response that integrates all effector cells of the immune system.
0 Ocular parasitosis: a rare cause of hypertensive uveitis. A middle-aged Asian gentleman presented with four weeks' history of recurrent redness, pain and deterioration of vision in his right eye. He was diagnosed with chronic, unilateral, granulomatous hypertensive uveitis. During one of the serial examinations a single, off-white, extremely motile, thread-like worm about 15 mm long was noted in the anterior chamber. Surgical retrieval of the worm was unsuccessful. The worm disappeared in the eye and was never seen again. Patient suffered from chronic waxing and waning granulomatous inflammation with uncontrolled high intraocular pressure despite treatment. The vision dropped down to no perception of light. Therapeutic success in such patients depends upon early and complete surgical removal of the worm, which could be a real challenge as worms are highly motile and only visible sporadically, as in this case. Ocular parasitosis should be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis in treating non-responsive chronic hypertensive granulomatous inflammation, especially if the patient is of Southeast Asian origin or has recently visited the region.
3 Rac1 regulates pancreatic islet morphogenesis. Pancreatic islets of Langerhans originate from endocrine progenitors within the pancreatic ductal epithelium. Concomitant with differentiation of these progenitors into hormone-producing cells such cells delaminate, aggregate and migrate away from the ductal epithelium. The cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating islet cell delamination and cell migration are poorly understood. Extensive biochemical and cell biological studies using cultured cells demonstrated that Rac1, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, acts as a key regulator of cell migration. To address the functional role of Rac1 in islet morphogenesis, we generated transgenic mice expressing dominant negative Rac1 under regulation of the Rat Insulin Promoter. Blocking Rac1 function in beta cells inhibited their migration away from the ductal epithelium in vivo. Consistently, transgenic islet cell spreading was compromised in vitro. We also show that the EGF-receptor ligand betacellulin induced actin remodelling and cell spreading in wild-type islets, but not in transgenic islets. Finally, we demonstrate that cell-cell contact E-cadherin increased as a consequence of blocking Rac1 activity. Our data support a model where Rac1 signalling controls islet cell migration by modulating E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, in vitro experiments show that betacellulin stimulated islet cell spreading and actin remodelling is compromised in transgenic islets, suggesting that betacellulin may act as a regulator of Rac1 activity and islet migration in vivo. Our results further emphasize Rac1 as a key regulator of cell migration and cell adhesion during tissue and organ morphogenesis.
3 Overexpression of SIRT1 protects pancreatic beta-cells against cytokine toxicity by suppressing the nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway. SIRT1, a class III histone/protein deacetylase, is known to interfere with the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway and thereby has an anti-inflammatory function. Because of the central role of NF-kappaB in cytokine-mediated pancreatic beta-cell damage, we postulated that SIRT1 might work in pancreatic beta-cell damage models. RINm5F (RIN) cells or isolated rat islets were treated with interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma. SIRT1 was activated by resveratrol, a pharmacological activator, or ectopic overexpression. The underlying mechanisms of SIRT1 against cytokine toxicity were further explored. Treatment of RIN cells with cytokines induced cell damage, and this damage was well correlated with the expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) and NO production. However, SIRT1 overexpression completely prevented cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity, NO production, and iNOS expression. The molecular mechanism by which SIRT1 inhibits iNOS expression appeared to involve the inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway through deacetylation of p65. In addition, SIRT1 activation by either resveratrol or adenoviral-directed overexpression of SIRT1 could prevent cytokine toxicity and maintain normal insulin-secreting responses to glucose in isolated rat islets. This study will provide valuable information not only into the mechanisms underlying beta-cell destruction but also into the regulation of SIRT1 as a possible target to attenuate cytokine-induced beta-cell damage.
1 The human ehrlichioses in the United States. The emerging tick-borne zoonoses human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) are under reported in the United States. From 1986 through 1997, 1,223 cases (742 HME, 449 HGE, and 32 not ascribed to a specific ehrlichial agent) were reported by state health departments. HME was most commonly reported from southeastern and southcentral states, while HGE was most often reported from northeastern and upper midwestern states. The annual number of reported cases increased sharply, from 69 in 1994 to 364 in 1997, coincident with an increase in the number of states making these conditions notifiable. From 1986 through 1997, 827 probable and confirmed cases were diagnosed by serologic testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although how many of these cases were also reported by states is not known. Improved national surveillance would provide a better assessment of the public health importance of ehrlichiosis.
3 How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species. The production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) by mammalian mitochondria is important because it underlies oxidative damage in many pathologies and contributes to retrograde redox signalling from the organelle to the cytosol and nucleus. Superoxide (O2(*-)) is the proximal mitochondrial ROS, and in the present review I outline the principles that govern O2(*-) production within the matrix of mammalian mitochondria. The flux of O2(*-) is related to the concentration of potential electron donors, the local concentration of O2 and the second-order rate constants for the reactions between them. Two modes of operation by isolated mitochondria result in significant O2(*-) production, predominantly from complex I: (i) when the mitochondria are not making ATP and consequently have a high Deltap (protonmotive force) and a reduced CoQ (coenzyme Q) pool; and (ii) when there is a high NADH/NAD+ ratio in the mitochondrial matrix. For mitochondria that are actively making ATP, and consequently have a lower Deltap and NADH/NAD+ ratio, the extent of O2(*-) production is far lower. The generation of O2(*-) within the mitochondrial matrix depends critically on Deltap, the NADH/NAD+ and CoQH2/CoQ ratios and the local O2 concentration, which are all highly variable and difficult to measure in vivo. Consequently, it is not possible to estimate O2(*-) generation by mitochondria in vivo from O2(*-)-production rates by isolated mitochondria, and such extrapolations in the literature are misleading. Even so, the description outlined here facilitates the understanding of factors that favour mitochondrial ROS production. There is a clear need to develop better methods to measure mitochondrial O2(*-) and H2O2 formation in vivo, as uncertainty about these values hampers studies on the role of mitochondrial ROS in pathological oxidative damage and redox signalling.
0 Cohesive versus flexible evolution of functional modules in eukaryotes. Although functionally related proteins can be reliably predicted from phylogenetic profiles, many functional modules do not seem to evolve cohesively according to case studies and systematic analyses in prokaryotes. In this study we quantify the extent of evolutionary cohesiveness of functional modules in eukaryotes and probe the biological and methodological factors influencing our estimates. We have collected various datasets of protein complexes and pathways in Saccheromyces cerevisiae. We define orthologous groups on 34 eukaryotic genomes and measure the extent of cohesive evolution of sets of orthologous groups of which members constitute a known complex or pathway. Within this framework it appears that most functional modules evolve flexibly rather than cohesively. Even after correcting for uncertain module definitions and potentially problematic orthologous groups, only 46% of pathways and complexes evolve more cohesively than random modules. This flexibility seems partly coupled to the nature of the functional module because biochemical pathways are generally more cohesively evolving than complexes.
0 Genome adaptation to chemical stress: clues from comparative transcriptomics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata. Recent technical and methodological advances have placed microbial models at the forefront of evolutionary and environmental genomics. To better understand the logic of genetic network evolution, we combined comparative transcriptomics, a differential clustering algorithm and promoter analyses in a study of the evolution of transcriptional networks responding to an antifungal agent in two yeast species: the free-living model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the human pathogen Candida glabrata. We found that although the gene expression patterns characterizing the response to drugs were remarkably conserved between the two species, part of the underlying regulatory networks differed. In particular, the roles of the oxidative stress response transcription factors ScYap1p (in S. cerevisiae) and Cgap1p (in C. glabrata) had diverged. The sets of genes whose benomyl response depends on these factors are significantly different. Also, the DNA motifs targeted by ScYap1p and Cgap1p are differently represented in the promoters of these genes, suggesting that the DNA binding properties of the two proteins are slightly different. Experimental assays of ScYap1p and Cgap1p activities in vivo were in accordance with this last observation. Based on these results and recently published data, we suggest that the robustness of environmental stress responses among related species contrasts with the rapid evolution of regulatory sequences, and depends on both the coevolution of transcription factor binding properties and the versatility of regulatory associations within transcriptional networks.
0 CLOCK expression identifies developing circadian oscillator neurons in the brains of Drosophila embryos. The Drosophila circadian oscillator is composed of transcriptional feedback loops in which CLOCK-CYCLE (CLK-CYC) heterodimers activate their feedback regulators period (per) and timeless (tim) via E-box mediated transcription. These feedback loop oscillators are present in distinct clusters of dorsal and lateral neurons in the adult brain, but how this pattern of expression is established during development is not known. Since CLK is required to initiate feedback loop function, defining the pattern of CLK expression in embryos and larvae will shed light on oscillator neuron development. A novel CLK antiserum is used to show that CLK expression in the larval CNS and adult brain is limited to circadian oscillator cells. CLK is initially expressed in presumptive small ventral lateral neurons (s-LNvs), dorsal neurons 2 s (DN2s), and dorsal neuron 1 s (DN1s) at embryonic stage (ES) 16, and this CLK expression pattern persists through larval development. PER then accumulates in all CLK-expressing cells except presumptive DN2s during late ES 16 and ES 17, consistent with the delayed accumulation of PER in adult oscillator neurons and antiphase cycling of PER in larval DN2s. PER is also expressed in non-CLK-expressing cells in the embryonic CNS starting at ES 12. Although PER expression in CLK-negative cells continues in ClkJrk embryos, PER expression in cells that co-express PER and CLK is eliminated. These data demonstrate that brain oscillator neurons begin development during embryogenesis, that PER expression in non-oscillator cells is CLK-independent, and that oscillator phase is an intrinsic characteristic of brain oscillator neurons. These results define the temporal and spatial coordinates of factors that initiate Clk expression, imply that circadian photoreceptors are not activated until the end of embryogenesis, and suggest that PER functions in a different capacity before oscillator cell development is initiated.
2 Long-term outcome after prophylactic lamivudine treatment on hepatitis B virus reactivation in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is the frequent complication after cytotoxic chemotherapy in HBsAg-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients. Pre-chemotherapy viral load may be a risk factor and HBeAg-positive status is associated with increased viral load. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term treatment outcome of lamivudine in preventing HBV reactivation and its associated morbidity according to HBeAg status. Twenty-four adult HBsAg-positive NHL patients were taken 100 mg of lamivudine daily before the initiation of chemotherapy. The median duration of lamivudine therapy was 11.5 months (range: 1-54 months) and the median number of chemotherapy cycles was 6 (range: 1-16 cycles). The steroid containing chemotherapy regimens were used in 18 patients (75%), and the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing chemotherapy regimen was used in 6 patients (25%). Four patients received autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation without resultant HBV reactivation. Hepatitis related to HBV reactivation was developed in 1 patient among 14 HBeAg-positive patients and no one among 10 HBeAg-negative. One patient developed HBV reactivation after lamivudine withdrawal, and 4 patients developed the YMDD (tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate) mutation during lamivudine therapy. There were no statistical differences in HBV reactivation rate during chemotherapy according to the HBeAg status. Our results demonstrate that lamivudine should be considered preemptively before the chemotherapy for all HBsAg-positive NHL patients to prevent HBV reactivation, regardless of pre-chemotherapy HBeAg status. Finally, compared with the chronic hepatitis B patients, similar rate of HBV reactivation after lamivudine withdrawal and development of YMDD mutation was observed in NHL patients.
1 Colicin E3 cleavage of 16S rRNA impairs decoding and accelerates tRNA translocation on Escherichia coli ribosomes. The cytotoxin colicin E3 targets the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and specifically cleaves 16S rRNA at the decoding centre, thereby inhibiting translation. Although the cleavage site is well known, it is not clear which step of translation is inhibited. We studied the effects of colicin E3 cleavage on ribosome functions by analysing individual steps of protein synthesis. We find that the cleavage affects predominantly the elongation step. The inhibitory effect of colicin E3 cleavage originates from the accumulation of sequential impaired decoding events, each of which results in low occupancy of the A site and, consequently, decreasing yield of elongating peptide. The accumulation leads to an almost complete halt of translation after reading of a few codons. The cleavage of 16S rRNA does not impair monitoring of codon-anticodon complexes or GTPase activation during elongation-factor Tu-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA, but decreases the stability of the codon-recognition complex and slows down aminoacyl-tRNA accommodation in the A site. The tRNA-mRNA translocation is faster on colicin E3-cleaved than on intact ribosomes and is less sensitive to inhibition by the antibiotic viomycin.
0 A giant upper eyelid ossifying pilomatrixoma. Pilomatrixoma of the eyelid is extremely rare in middle age and rarely develops into a large tumor. A 45-year-old female developed a painless, progressive swelling (3.0 cm x 2.0 cm) of the left upper eyelid over a period of two years. Overlying skin was normal in color and texture. A differential diagnosis of dermoid, epidermoid cyst, chalazion and basal cell carcinoma was made. An excisional biopsy was performed. A diagnosis of pilomatrixoma was made on histopathological features (dystrophic calcification of matrix with keratin and foreign body granulomatous reaction, basaloid cells and shadow cells/ghost cells). It also comprises ossification apart from the usual calcification. This is a report of an unusually large ossifying pilomatrixoma in left upper eyelid of a middle-aged woman. The patient should be followed up at regular intervals to rule out any recurrence or malignant transformation.
1 Antimicrobial-drug use and changes in resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to antimicrobial drugs is increasing. To investigate the relationship between antimicrobial use and susceptibility of S. pneumoniae isolates at 24 U.S. medical centers, we obtained data on outpatient antimicrobial-drug use for the regions surrounding 23 of these centers. We found an association between decreased penicillin susceptibility and use of beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs.
0 Evolution of nonstop, no-go and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and their termination factor-derived components. Members of the eukaryote/archaea specific eRF1 and eRF3 protein families have central roles in translation termination. They are also central to various mRNA surveillance mechanisms, together with the eRF1 paralogue Dom34p and the eRF3 paralogues Hbs1p and Ski7p. We have examined the evolution of eRF1 and eRF3 families using sequence similarity searching, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. Extensive BLAST searches confirm that Hbs1p and eRF3 are limited to eukaryotes, while Dom34p and eRF1 (a/eRF1) are universal in eukaryotes and archaea. Ski7p appears to be restricted to a subset of Saccharomyces species. Alignments show that Dom34p does not possess the characteristic class-1 RF minidomains GGQ, NIKS and YXCXXXF, in line with recent crystallographic analysis of Dom34p. Phylogenetic trees of the protein families allow us to reconstruct the evolution of mRNA surveillance mechanisms mediated by these proteins in eukaryotes and archaea. We propose that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and archaea possessed Dom34p-mediated no-go decay (NGD). This ancestral Dom34p may or may not have required a trGTPase, mostly like a/eEF1A, for its delivery to the ribosome. At an early stage in eukaryotic evolution, eEF1A was duplicated, giving rise to eRF3, which was recruited for translation termination, interacting with eRF1. eRF3 evolved nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) activity either before or after it was again duplicated, giving rise to Hbs1p, which we propose was recruited to assist eDom34p in eukaryotic NGD. Finally, a third duplication within ascomycete yeast gave rise to Ski7p, which may have become specialised for a subset of existing Hbs1p functions in non-stop decay (NSD). We suggest Ski7p-mediated NSD may be a specialised mechanism for counteracting the effects of increased stop codon read-through caused by prion-domain [PSI+] mediated eRF3 precipitation.
1 The impact of education on risk factors and the occurrence of multimorbidity in the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort. In aging populations, the prevalence of multimorbidity is high, and the role of socioeconomic status and its correlates is not well described. Thus, we investigated the association between educational attainment and multimorbidity in a prospective cohort study, taking also into account intermediate factors that could explain such associations. We included 13,781 participants of the Heidelberg cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), who were 50-75 years at the end of follow-up. Information on diet and lifestyle was collected at recruitment (1994-1998). During a median follow-up of 8.7 years, information on chronic conditions and death were collected. Overall, the prevalence of multimorbidity (>= 2 concurrent chronic diseases) was 67.3%. Compared to the highest educational category, the lowest was statistically significantly associated with increased odds of multimorbidity in men (OR = 1.43; 95% CI 1.28-1.61) and women (OR = 1.33; 95% CI 1.18-1.57). After adjustment, the positive associations were attenuated (men: OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.12-1.46; women: OR = 1.16; 95% CI 0.99-1.36). Increasing BMI was more strongly than smoking status an intermediate factor in the association between education and multimorbidity. In this German population, the prevalence of multimorbidity is high and is significantly associated with educational level. Increasing BMI is the most important predictor of this association. However, even the fully adjusted model, i.e. considering also other known risk factors for chronic diseases, could not entirely explain socio-economic inequalities in multimorbidity. Educational level should be considered in the development and implementation of prevention strategies of multimorbidity.
2 Efficacy and safety of vertebroplasty for treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures: a randomised controlled trial [ACTRN012605000079640]. Vertebroplasty is a promising but as yet unproven treatment for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. It involves radiographic-guided injection of various types of bone cement directly into the vertebral fracture site. Uncontrolled studies and two controlled quasi-experimental before-after studies comparing volunteers who were offered treatment to those who refused it, have suggested an early benefit including rapid pain relief and improved function. Conversely, several uncontrolled studies and one of the controlled before-after studies have also suggested that vertebroplasty may increase the risk of subsequent vertebral fractures, particularly in vertebrae adjacent to treated levels or if cement leakage into the adjacent disc has occurred. As yet, there are no completed randomised controlled trials of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The aims of this participant and outcome assessor-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial are to i) determine the short-term efficacy and safety (3 months) of vertebroplasty for alleviating pain and improving function for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures; and ii) determine its medium to longer-term efficacy and safety, particularly the risk of further fracture over 2 years. A double-blind randomised controlled trial of 200 participants with one or two recent painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Participants will be stratified by duration of symptoms (< and >or= 6 weeks), gender and treating radiologist and randomly allocated to either the treatment or placebo. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Outcome measures include overall, night and rest pain on 10 cm visual analogue scales, quality of life measured by the Assessment of Quality of Life, Osteoporosis Quality of Life and EQ-5D questionnaires; participant perceived recovery on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from 'a great deal worse' to 'a great deal better'; disability measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire; timed 'Up and Go' test; and adverse effects. The presence of new fractures will be assessed by radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine performed at 12 and 24 months. The results of this trial will be of major international importance and findings will be immediately translatable into clinical practice.
3 Active play and screen time in US children aged 4 to 11 years in relation to sociodemographic and weight status characteristics: a nationally representative cross-sectional analysis. The high prevalence of childhood obesity underscores the importance of monitoring population trends in children's activity and screen time, and describing associations with child age, gender, race/ethnicity, and weight status. Our objective was to estimate the proportion of young children in the US who have low levels of active play or high levels of screen time, or who have both these behaviors, and to describe associations with age, gender, race/ethnicity, and weight status. We analyzed data collected during the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2001-2004, a US nationally representative cross-sectional study. We studied 2964 children aged 4.00 to 11.99 years. Our main outcomes were reported weekly times that the child played or exercised hard enough to sweat or breathe hard (active play), daily hours the child watched television/videos, used computers, or played computer games (screen time), and the combination of low active play and high screen time. Low active play was defined as active play 6 times or less per week. High screen time was defined as more than 2 hours per day. We accounted for the complex survey design in analyses and report proportions and 95% confidence intervals. We used Wald Chi-square to test for differences between proportions. To identify factors associated with low active play and high screen time, we used multivariate logistic regression. Of US children aged 4 to 11 years, 37.3% (95% confidence interval, 34.1% to 40.4%) had low levels of active play, 65.0% (95% CI, 61.4% to 68.5%) had high screen time, and 26.3% (95% CI, 23.8% to 28.9%) had both these behaviors. Characteristics associated with a higher probability of simultaneously having low active play and high screen time were older age, female gender, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, and having a BMI-for-age > or =95th percentile of the CDC growth reference. Many young children in the US are reported to have physical activity and screen time behaviors that are inconsistent with recommendations for healthy pediatric development. Children who are overweight, approaching adolescence, girls, and non-Hispanic blacks may benefit most from public health policies and programs aimed at these behaviors.
0 The sleeping brain's influence on verbal memory: boosting resistance to interference. Memories evolve. After learning something new, the brain initiates a complex set of post-learning processing that facilitates recall (i.e., consolidation). Evidence points to sleep as one of the determinants of that change. But whenever a behavioral study of episodic memory shows a benefit of sleep, critics assert that sleep only leads to a temporary shelter from the damaging effects of interference that would otherwise accrue during wakefulness. To evaluate the potentially active role of sleep for verbal memory, we compared memory recall after sleep, with and without interference before testing. We demonstrated that recall performance for verbal memory was greater after sleep than after wakefulness. And when using interference testing, that difference was even more pronounced. By introducing interference after sleep, this study confirms an experimental paradigm that demonstrates the active role of sleep in consolidating memory, and unmasks the large magnitude of that benefit.
3 Astrocytic mechanisms explaining neural-activity-induced shrinkage of extraneuronal space. Neuronal stimulation causes approximately 30% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in grey and white matter under experimental conditions. Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.
2 Visual function after primary posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in pediatric unilateral cataract: stereopsis and visual acuity. To investigate the association between binocular function and vision after cataract removal and primary posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) implantation in children with unilateral cataract and to identify visual function differences according cataract type. Clinical records of 2- to 6-year-old patients with unilateral cataract removal and primary PC-IOL implantation were reviewed retrospectively. Visual acuity and ocular alignment were measured. Sensory fusion was assessed with the Worth 4-dot test, and stereoacuity with the Titmus stereo test. Cataracts were classified according to cause, lens opacity location, age at onset, and presence of strabismus. Clinical characteristics of patients who obtained good visual function were identified. Forty-seven patients were included. Among 22 (46.8%) with good vision (20/40 or better), only 6 (27.3%) achieved good binocular function (the presence of fusion and 100 seconds of arc or better of stereoacuity). Visual acuity was better in eyes with good binocular function (p=0.002). No other variables were significant for achieving good binocular function. The removal of unilateral cataract in a visually immature child can result in a combination of good visual acuity and binocular function. Good binocular function is closely related to good visual acuity.
0 Use of suppression subtractive hybridization to identify genes regulated by ciliary neurotrophic factor in postnatal retinal explants. The retinal progenitors are multipotential, and the decision taken by a progenitor to differentiate along a particular path depends on both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family, added to rat postnatal retinal progenitors inhibits rod photoreceptor cell differentiation, promotes Müller glia genesis and enhances the expression of bipolar neuron markers. We hypothesized that those transcripts regulated during CNTF-influenced retinal differentiation may be involved in the choice of progenitor cell fate. Our aim was to isolate these genes, characterize their expression in the retina, and to subsequently focus on candidates that may promote photoreceptor cell differentiation. Retinas were cultured in vitro as explants at postnatal day 0 (P0) in the absence or presence of CNTF for six days. Transcripts regulated by CNTF after six days in vitro (DIV) were selected by subtraction suppressive hybridization (SSH) and cloned as two libraries. The UC6 and DC6 libraries contained those genes upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in the presence of CNTF at 6DIV. In the first library, UC6, eight clones representing seven different genes were isolated as up-regulated by CNTF. In the DC6 library, 21 clones, representing 17 different genes appeared as down-regulated by CNTF. Genes were classified in six categories, such as protein modification, signal transduction, and regulation of transcription according to the Gene Ontology Annotation. Among the 24 selected genes, our study revealed 11 genes (two upregulated and nine downregulated) potentially involved in CNTF biological effects.
1 Individuals appreciate having their medication record on the web: a survey of attitudes to a national pharmacy register. Many patients receive health care in different settings. Thus, a limitation of clinical care may be inaccurate medication lists, since data exchange between settings is often lacking and patients do not regularly self-report on changes in their medication. Health care professionals and patients are both interested in utilizing electronic health information. However, opinion is divided as to who should take responsibility for maintaining personal health records. In Sweden, the government has passed a law to enforce and fund a national register of dispensed medications. The register comprises all individuals with dispensed medications (6.4 million individuals, September 2006) and can be accessed by the individual online via "My dispensed medications". The individual has the right to restrict the accessibility of the information in health care settings. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the users' attitudes towards their access to "My dispensed medications" as part of a new interactive Internet service on prescribed medications. A password-protected Web survey was conducted among a first group of users of "My dispensed medications". Data was anonymously collected and analyzed with regard to the usefulness and design of the Web site, the respondents' willingness to discuss their "My dispensed medications" with others, their reasons for access, and their source of information about the service. During the study period (January-March, 2007), all 7860 unique site visitors were invited to answer the survey. Invitations were accepted by 2663 individuals, and 1716 responded to the online survey yielding a view rate of 21.8% (1716/7860) and a completion rate of 64.4% (1716/2663). The completeness rate for each question was in the range of 94.9% (1629/1716) to 99.5% (1707/1716). In general, the respondents' expectations of the usefulness of "My dispensed medications" were high (total median grade 5; Inter Quartile Range [IQR] 3, on a scale 1-6). They were also positive about the design of the Web site (total median grade 5; IQR 1, on a scale 1-6). The high grades were not dependent on age or number of drugs. A majority of the respondents, 60.4% (1037/1716), had learned about "My dispensed medications" from pharmacies. 70.4% (1208/1716) of all respondents said they visited "My dispensed medications" to get control or an overview of their drugs. Getting control was a more common (P < .001) answer for the elderly (age 75 or above), whereas curiosity was more common (P < .001) for the younger age group (18-44 years). We found that users of the provider-based personal medication record "My dispensed medications" appreciated the access to their record. Since we found that the respondents liked the design of the Web site and perceived that the information was easy to understand, the study provided no reason for system changes. However, a need for more information about the register, and to extend its use, was recognized.
1 Functional genomic analysis of drug sensitivity pathways to guide adjuvant strategies in breast cancer. The widespread introduction of high throughput RNA interference screening technology has revealed tumour drug sensitivity pathways to common cytotoxics such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil, targeted agents such as trastuzumab and inhibitors of AKT and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) as well as endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen. Given the limited power of microarray signatures to predict therapeutic response in associative studies of small clinical trial cohorts, the use of functional genomic data combined with expression or sequence analysis of genes and microRNAs implicated in drug response in human tumours may provide a more robust method to guide adjuvant treatment strategies in breast cancer that are transferable across different expression platforms and patient cohorts.
0 Targeting retinal dopaminergic neurons in tyrosine hydroxylase-driven green fluorescent protein transgenic zebrafish. Dopamine plays key roles in a variety of basic functions in the central nervous system. To study developmental and functional roles of dopaminergic cells in zebrafish, we have generated a transgenic line of zebrafish expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase (th1) promoter. A 12 kb gene fragment that contains the th1 promoter was isolated and ligated to the MmGFP coding sequence, linearized, microinjected into 1-2 cell stage embryos and the founders crossed with wild-type fish to screen for transgenic lines. Tg(-12th:MmGFP) embryos were visualized under fluorescence microscopy for GFP expression during development. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize GFP-labeled cells in the living whole mount retina and immunostained vertical sections of adult zebrafish retina. Single-cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on individual GFP+ cells collected from dispersed retinal cell cultures for th1 and dopamine transporter (dat). Loose-patch recordings of spike activity of GFP+ neurons were made in isolated whole mount retinas. th1 promoter-driven GFP exhibited robust expression in the brain and retina during zebrafish development. In juvenile and adult fish retinas, GFP was expressed in cells located in the inner nuclear layer. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies for GFP and TH showed that 29+/-2% of GFP-labeled cells also expressed TH. Two subpopulations of GFP-labeled cells were identified by fluorescent microscopy: bright GFP-expressing cells and dim GFP-expressing cells. Seminested single-cell RT-PCR showed that 71% of dim GFP-expressing cells expressed both th and dat mRNA. Loose-patch voltage-clamp recording from dim GFP-labeled cells in retinal whole mounts revealed that many of these dopaminergic neurons are spontaneously active in darkness. Although this Tg(-12th:MmGFP) line is not a completely specific reporter for dopaminergic neurons, using relative GFP intensity we are able to enrich for the selection of retinal dopaminergic cells in vitro and in situ in molecular and electrophysiological experiments. This transgenic line provides a useful tool for studying retinal dopaminergic cells in the zebrafish.
1 Quantitative assessment of early diabetic retinopathy using fractal analysis. Fractal analysis can quantify the geometric complexity of the retinal vascular branching pattern and may therefore offer a new method to quantify early diabetic microvascular damage. In this study, we examined the relationship between retinal fractal dimension and retinopathy in young individuals with type 1 diabetes. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 729 patients with type 1 diabetes (aged 12-20 years) who had seven-field stereoscopic retinal photographs taken of both eyes. From these photographs, retinopathy was graded according to the modified Airlie House classification, and fractal dimension was quantified using a computer-based program following a standardized protocol. In this study, 137 patients (18.8%) had diabetic retinopathy signs; of these, 105 had mild retinopathy. Median (interquartile range) retinal fractal dimension was 1.46214 (1.45023-1.47217). After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration, A1C, blood pressure, and total cholesterol, increasing retinal vascular fractal dimension was significantly associated with increasing odds of retinopathy (odds ratio 3.92 [95% CI 2.02-7.61] for fourth versus first quartile of fractal dimension). In multivariate analysis, each 0.01 increase in retinal vascular fractal dimension was associated with a nearly 40% increased odds of retinopathy (1.37 [1.21-1.56]). This association remained after additional adjustment for retinal vascular caliber. Greater retinal fractal dimension, representing increased geometric complexity of the retinal vasculature, is independently associated with early diabetic retinopathy signs in type 1 diabetes. Fractal analysis of fundus photographs may allow quantitative measurement of early diabetic microvascular damage.
3 Opposed circulating plasma levels of endothelin-1 and C-type natriuretic peptide in children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria (SM), are not yet fully understood. Both endothelin-1 (ET-1) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) are produced by vascular endothelium and act locally as paracrine regulators of vascular tone, ET-1 being a potent vasoconstrictor and CNP having strong vasorelaxant properties. Plasma levels of ET-1 and N-terminal fragments of CNP (NT-proCNP) were studied on admission and after 24 hours of treatment, using enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay (ELISA) technique, in Gabonese children with severe falciparum malaria (SM, n = 50), with uncomplicated malaria (UM, n = 39) and healthy controls (HC, n = 25). Compared to HC, malaria patients had significantly higher plasma levels of ET-1 and significantly lower levels of NT-proCNP (p < 0.001 and p < 0.024 respectively). Plasma levels of NT-proCNP were additionally decreased in SM patients compared to HC (p = 0.034), whereas UM was not significantly different to HC. In the SM group we found a trend towards lower ET-1 levels compared to UM (p = 0.085). In the present study, an imbalance between the vasoconstricitve and vasorelaxant endothelium-derived substances ET-1 and CNP in the plasma of children with falciparum malaria is demonstrated, presumably in favor of vasoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory effects. These results may indicate involvement of ET-1 and CNP in malaria pathogenesis. Furthermore, results of lower ET-1 and CNP levels in SM may reflect endothelial cell damage.
0 Comparative genomics and understanding of microbial biology. The sequences of close to 30 microbial genomes have been completed during the past 5 years, and the sequences of more than 100 genomes should be completed in the next 2 to 4 years. Soon, completed microbial genome sequences will represent a collection of >200,000 predicted coding sequences. While analysis of a single genome provides tremendous biological insights on any given organism, comparative analysis of multiple genomes provides substantially more information on the physiology and evolution of microbial species and expands our ability to better assign putative function to predicted coding sequences.
1 Predictors of long time survival after lung cancer surgery: a retrospective cohort study. There have been few reports regarding long time survival after lung cancer surgery. The influence of age and pulmonary function on long time survival is still not fully discovered. Some reports suggest that hospitals with a high surgical volume have better results. The aim of this study was to evaluate lung cancer surgery performed in a county hospital in terms of 30 days mortality, complications and predictors of long time survival. All patients operated with non-small cell lung cancer in the period 1993-2006 were reviewed, and 148 patients were included in the study. 30 days mortality and complications were analyzed by univariate analysis. Kaplan Meier plots were performed to display some of the univariate variables. Cox regression analysis was performed to find Hazard Ratios (HR) that predicted long time survival in univariate and multivariate analysis. The overall 30 days mortality rate was 2.7%, whereas 36.3% had one or more complications after surgery. The median survival time was 3.4 years. In multivariate Cox regression analysis advanced preoperative stage predicted reduced long time survival with HR (95%CI) 1.63 (0.92, 2.89) and 4.16 (1.92, 9.05) for patients in stage IB and II-IV respectively, when compared to patients in stage IA. Age >or= 70 years and FEV1<80% predicted reduced long time survival with HR (95%CI) 2.23 (1.41, 3.54) and 1.93 (1.14, 3.28) respectively, compared to age<70 years and FEV1 >or= 80%. Thirty days mortality and complication rate showed that lung cancer surgery can be performed safely in a county hospital with experienced thoracic surgeons. Early preoperative stage, age below 70 years and normal pulmonary function predicted long time survival.
0 Variations in host genes encoding adhesion molecules and susceptibility to falciparum malaria in India. Host adhesion molecules play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and changes in their structure or levels in individuals can influence the outcome of infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of SNPs of three adhesion molecule genes, ICAM1, PECAM1 and CD36, with severity of falciparum malaria in a malaria-endemic and a non-endemic region of India. The frequency distribution of seven selected SNPs of ICAM1, PECAM1 and CD36 was determined in 552 individuals drawn from 24 populations across India. SNP-disease association was analysed in a case-control study format. Genotyping of the population panel was performed by Sequenom mass spectroscopy and patient/control samples were genotyped by SNaPshot method. Haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium (LD) plots were generated using PHASE and Haploview, respectively. Odds-ratio (OR) for risk assessment was estimated using EpiInfotrade mark version 3.4. Association of the ICAM1 rs5498 (exon 6) G allele and the CD36 exon 1a A allele with increased risk of severe malaria was observed (severe versus control, OR = 1.91 and 2.66, P = 0.02 and 0.0012, respectively). The CD36 rs1334512 (-53) T allele as well as the TT genotype associated with protection from severe disease (severe versus control, TT versus GG, OR = 0.37, P = 0.004). Interestingly, a SNP of the PECAM1 gene (rs668, exon 3, C/G) with low minor allele frequency in populations of the endemic region compared to the non-endemic region exhibited differential association with disease in these regions; the G allele was a risk factor for malaria in the endemic region, but exhibited significant association with protection from disease in the non-endemic region. The data highlights the significance of variations in the ICAM1, PECAM1 and CD36 genes in the manifestation of falciparum malaria in India. The PECAM1 exon 3 SNP exhibits altered association with disease in the endemic and non-endemic region.
3 Decision making preferences in the medical encounter--a factorial survey design. Up to now it has not been systematically investigated in which kind of clinical situations a consultation style based on shared decision making (SDM) is preferred by patients and physicians. We suggest the factorial survey design to address this problem.This method, which so far has hardly been used in health service research, allows to vary relevant factors describing clinical situations as variables systematically in an experimental random design and to investigate their importance in large samples. To identify situational factors for the survey we first performed a literature search which was followed by a qualitative interview study with patients, physicians and health care experts. As a result, 7 factors (e.g. "Reason for consultation" and "Number of therapeutic options") with 2 to 3 levels (e.g. "One therapeutic option" and "More than one therapeutic option") will be included in the study. For the survey the factor levels will be randomly combined to short stories describing different treatment situations.A randomized sample of all possible short stories will be given to at least 300 subjects (100 GPs, 100 patients and 100 members of self-help groups) who will be asked to rate how the decision should be made. Main outcome measure is the preference for participation in the decision making process in the given clinical situation.Data analysis will estimate the effects of the factors on the rating and also examine differences between groups. The results will reveal the effects of situational variations on participation preferences. Thus, our findings will contribute to the understanding of normative values in the medical decision making process and will improve future implementation of SDM and decision aids.
1 Diagnostic performance of CT colonography for the detection of colorectal polyps. To investigate the diagnostic value of CT colonography for the detection of colorectal polyps. From December 2004 to December 2005, 399 patients underwent CT colonography and follow-up conventional colonoscopy. We excluded cases of advanced colorectal cancer. We retrospectively analyzed the CT colonography findings and follow-up conventional colonoscopy findings of 113 patients who had polyps more than 6 mm in diameter. Radiologists using 3D and 2D computer generated displays interpreted the CT colonography images. The colonoscopists were aware of the CT colonography findings before the procedure. CT colonography detected 132 polyps in 107 of the 113 patients and conventional colonoscopy detected 114 colorectal polyps more than 6 mm in diameter in 87 of the 113 patients. The sensitivity of CT colonography analyzed per polyp was 91% (41/45) for polyps more than 10 mm in diameter and 89% (101/114) for polyps more than 6 mm in diameter. Thirteen polyps were missed by CT colonography and were detected on follow-up conventional colonoscopy. CT colonography is a sensitive diagnostic tool for the detection of colorectal polyps and adequate bowel preparation, optimal bowel distention and clinical experience are needed to reduce the rate of missing appropriate lesions.
2 Antimicrobial drug use and resistance in Europe. Our study confronts the use of antimicrobial agents in ambulatory care with the resistance trends of 2 major pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, in 21 European countries in 2000-2005 and explores whether the notion that antimicrobial drug use determines resistance can be supported by surveillance data at national aggregation levels. The data obtained from the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption and the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System suggest that variation of consumption coincides with the occurrence of resistance at the country level. Linear regression analysis showed that the association between antimicrobial drug use and resistance was specific and robust for 2 of 3 compound pathogen combinations, stable over time, but not sensitive enough to explain all of the observed variations. Ecologic studies based on routine surveillance data indicate a relation between use and resistance and support interventions designed to reduce antimicrobial drug consumption at a national level in Europe.
3 Legionella species colonization of water distribution systems, pools and air conditioning systems in cruise ships and ferries. Legionnaires' disease continues to be a public health concern in passenger ships. This study was scheduled in order to investigate Legionella spp. colonization of water distribution systems (WDS), recreational pools, and air-conditioning systems on board ferries and cruise ships in an attempt to identify risk factors for Legionella spp. colonization associated with ship water systems and water characteristics. Water systems of 21 ferries and 10 cruise ships including WDS, air conditioning systems and pools were investigated for the presence of Legionella spp. The 133 samples collected from the 10 cruise ships WDS, air conditioning systems and pools were negative for Legionella spp. Of the 21 ferries WDS examined, 14 (66.7%) were legionellae-positive. A total of 276 samples were collected from WDS and air conditioning systems. Legionella spp. was isolated from 37.8% of the hot water samples and 17.5% of the cold water samples. Of the total 96 positive isolates, 87 (90.6%) were L. pneumophila. Legionella spp. colonization was positively associated with ship age. The temperature of the hot water samples was negatively associated with colonization of L. pneumophila serogroup (sg) 1 and that of L. pneumophila sg 2 to 14. Increases in pH >/=7.8 and total plate count > or =400 CFU/L, correlated positively with the counts of L. pneumophila sg 2 to 14 and Legionella spp. respectively. Free chlorine of > or =0.2 mg/L inhibited colonization of Legionella spp. WDS of ferries can be heavily colonized by Legionella spp. and may present a risk of Legionnaires' disease for passengers and crew members. Guidelines and advising of Legionnaires' disease prevention regarding ferries are needed, in particular for operators and crew members.
1 Using pathway signatures as means of identifying similarities among microarray experiments. Widespread use of microarrays has generated large amounts of data, the interrogation of the public microarray repositories, identifying similarities between microarray experiments is now one of the major challenges. Approaches using defined group of genes, such as pathways and cellular networks (pathway analysis), have been proposed to improve the interpretation of microarray experiments. We propose a novel method to compare microarray experiments at the pathway level, this method consists of two steps: first, generate pathway signatures, a set of descriptors recapitulating the biologically meaningful pathways related to some clinical/biological variable of interest, second, use these signatures to interrogate microarray databases. We demonstrate that our approach provides more reliable results than with gene-based approaches. While gene-based approaches tend to suffer from bias generated by the analytical procedures employed, our pathway based method successfully groups together similar samples, independently of the experimental design. The results presented are potentially of great interest to improve the ability to query and compare experiments in public repositories of microarray data. As a matter of fact, this method can be used to retrieve data from public microarray databases and perform comparisons at the pathway level.
0 The cystic fibrosis transmembrane recruiter the alter ego of CFTR as a multi-kinase anchor. This review focuses on a newly discovered interaction between protein kinases involved in cellular energetics, a process that may be disturbed in cystic fibrosis for unknown reasons. I propose a new model where kinase-mediated cellular transmission of energy provides mechanistic insight to a latent role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). I suggest that CFTR acts as a multi-kinase recruiter to the apical epithelial membrane. My group finds that, in the cytosol, two protein kinases involved in cell energy homeostasis, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), bind one another. Preliminary data suggest that both can also bind CFTR (function unclear). The disrupted role of this CFTR-kinase complex as 'membrane transmitter to the cell' is proposed as an alternative paradigm to the conventional ion transport mediated and CFTR/chloride-centric view of cystic fibrosis pathogenesis. Chloride remains important, but instead, chloride-induced control of the phosphohistidine content of one kinase component (NDPK, via a multi-kinase complex that also includes a third kinase, CK2; formerly casein kinase 2). I suggest that this complex provides the necessary near-equilibrium conditions needed for efficient transmission of phosphate energy to proteins controlling cellular energetics. Crucially, a new role for CFTR as a kinase controller is proposed with ionic concentration acting as a signal. The model posits a regulatory control relay for energy sensing involving a cascade of protein kinases bound to CFTR.
3 Hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)-1 activity and diacylglycerol but not ceramide concentrations are increased in the nonalcoholic human fatty liver. To determine whether 1) hepatic ceramide and diacylglycerol concentrations, 2) SCD1 activity, and 3) hepatic lipogenic index are increased in the human nonalcoholic fatty liver. We studied 16 subjects with (n = 8) and without (n = 8) histologically determined nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL(+) and NAFL(-)) matched for age, sex, and BMI. Hepatic concentrations of lipids and fatty acids were quantitated using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and gas chromatography. The absolute (nmol/mg) hepatic concentrations of diacylglycerols but not ceramides were increased in the NAFL(+) group compared with the NAFL(-) group. The livers of the NAFL(+) group contained proportionally less long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids as compared with the NAFL(-) group. Liver fat percent was positively related to hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) activity index (r = 0.70, P = 0.003) and the hepatic lipogenic index (r = 0.54, P = 0.030). Hepatic SCD1 activity index was positively related to the concentrations of diacylglycerols (r = 0.71, P = 0.002) but not ceramides (r = 0.07, NS). We conclude that diacylglycerols but not ceramides are increased in NAFL. The human fatty liver is also characterized by depletion of long polyunsaturated fatty acids in the liver and increases in hepatic SCD1 and lipogenic activities.
3 The first major outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Delhi, India. India An outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHS/DSS) occurred in 1996 in India in and near Delhi. The cause was confirmed as dengue virus type 2, by virus cultivation and indirect immunofluorescence with type-specific monoclonal antibodies. This is the largest such outbreak reported from India, indicating a serious resurgence of dengue virus infection.
1 Pulsatile ocular blood flow in healthy Koreans. To determine the normal reference range of pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) values in healthy Korean subjects and to find out the factors that may affect them. A total of 280 eyes of 280 normal subjects were included in this study. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), axial length, POBF, systemic blood pressure, and pulse rate were measured. The mean, standard deviation, range, and the 5th and 95th percentiles of POBF were calculated, and the influences of various parameters to POBF were determined by multiple regression analyses. The mean POBF value was 766.0+/-221.6 microl/min in men and 1021.1+/-249.5 microl/min in women. The 5th and 95th percentiles for POBF values were 486.0 microl/min and 1140.0 microl/min in men and 672.0 microl/min and 1458.0 microl/min in women. The POBF values were significantly influenced by gender, mean blood pressure, pulse rate, and axial length. Even though the POBF values were influenced by gender, BP, and axial length, we could define the normal reference range of POBF in healthy Koreans.
2 The evolving role of oestrogen receptor beta in clinical breast cancer. Controversy surrounds the potential clinical importance of oestrogen receptor (ER)beta in breast cancer, and three recent papers have sought to resolve this. In the present issue of Breast Cancer Research Novelli and colleagues explored the significance of ERbeta1 expression in 936 breast cancer patients, and they showed diverse relationships according to lymph node status. A second paper examined 442 breast cancers in which ERbeta1 was an independent predictor of recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival. Finally a third paper showed that ERbeta2 was a powerful prognostic indicator in 757 breast cancers but this was dependent on cellular location, with nuclear ERbeta2 expression predicting good survival whilst cytoplasmic expression predicted worse outcome. These papers point to a clinical role for ERbeta in breast cancer and shall be discussed.
2 Evaluation of deep vein thrombosis with multidetector row CT after orthopedic arthroplasty: a prospective study for comparison with Doppler sonography. This prospective study evaluated the ability of indirect 16-row multidetector CT venography, in comparison with Doppler sonography, to detect deep vein thrombosis after total hip or knee replacement. Sixty-two patients had undergone orthopedic replacement surgery on a total of 30 hip joints and 54 knee joints. The CT venography (scan delay time: 180 seconds; slice thickness/increment: 2/1.5 mm) and Doppler sonography were performed 8 to 40 days after surgery. We measured the z-axis length of the beam hardening artifact that degraded the image quality so that the presence of deep vein thrombosis couldn't be evaluated on the axial CT images. The incidence and location of deep vein thrombosis was analyzed. The diagnostic performance of the CT venograms was evaluated and compared with that of Doppler sonography as a standard of reference. The z-axis length (mean +/- standard deviation) of the beam hardening artifact was 4.5 +/- 0.8 cm in the arthroplastic knees and 3.9 +/- 2.9 cm in the arthroplastic hips. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was found in the popliteal or calf veins on Doppler sonography in 30 (48%) of the 62 patients. The CT venography has a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 90%, 97%, 96%, 91% and 94%, respectively. The ability of CT venography to detect DVT was comparable to that of Doppler sonography despite of beam hardening artifact. Therefore, CT venography is feasible to use as an alternative modality for evaluating post-arthroplasty patients.
3 Sensing of dietary lipids by enterocytes: a new role for SR-BI/CLA-1. The intestine is responsible for absorbing dietary lipids and delivering them to the organism as triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL). It is important to determine how this process is regulated in enterocytes, the absorptive cells of the intestine, as prolonged postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis. During the postprandial period, dietary lipids, mostly triglycerides (TG) hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes, are combined with bile products and reach the apical membrane of enterocytes as postprandial micelles (PPM). Our aim was to determine whether these micelles induce, in enterocytes, specific early cell signaling events that could control the processes leading to TRL secretion. The effects of supplying PPM to the apex of Caco-2/TC7 enterocytes were analyzed. Micelles devoid of TG hydrolysis products, like those present in the intestinal lumen in the interprandial period, were used as controls. The apical delivery of PPM specifically induced a number of cellular events that are not induced by interprandial micelles. These early events included the trafficking of apolipoprotein B, a structural component of TRL, from apical towards secretory domains, and the rapid, dose-dependent activation of ERK and p38MAPK. PPM supply induced the scavenger receptor SR-BI/CLA-1 to cluster at the apical brush border membrane and to move from non-raft to raft domains. Competition, inhibition or knockdown of SR-BI/CLA-1 impaired the PPM-dependent apoB trafficking and ERK activation. These results are the first evidence that enterocytes specifically sense postprandial dietary lipid-containing micelles. SR-BI/CLA-1 is involved in this process and could be a target for further study with a view to modifying intestinal TRL secretion early in the control pathway.
2 Effects of intraluminal irradiation with Holmium-166 for TIPS stenosis: experimental study in a swine model. We wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of intraluminal irradiation with Holmium-166 ((166)Ho) for reducing the pseudointimal hyperplasia (PIH) in the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) tract in a swine model. TIPS was performed in 12 domestic pigs, after the creation of portal hypertension by intraportal injection of a mixture of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and lipiodol. Five pigs first underwent intraluminal irradiation (30 Gy) in the parenchymal tract with using a (166)Ho solution-filled balloon catheter, and this was followed by the placement of a nitinol stent in the TIPS tract. For the seven control pigs, the balloon was filled with saline and contrast media mixture. Two weeks later, follow-up portography and histological analysis were performed. TIPS was successfully performed in all twelve pigs with achieving artificially induced portal hypertension. Portography performed two weeks after TIPS showed the patent tracts in the TIPS tracts that were irradiated with (166)Ho (5/5, 100%), whereas either completely (5/6, 83.3%) or partially (1/6, 16.7%) occluded TIPS were seen in the seven pigs of the nonirradiated control group, except in one pig that experienced periprocedural death due to bleeding. Histological analysis showed a statistically significant difference for the maximal PIH (irradiated: 32.8%, nonirradiated: 76.0%, p < 0.001) between the two groups. Intraluminal irradiation with 30 Gy of (166)Ho for TIPS significantly improved the TIPS patency in a swine model of portal hypertension during a 2-week period of follow-up.
0 Network-based approaches for linking metabolism with environment. Progress in the reconstruction of genome-wide metabolic maps has led to the development of network-based computational approaches for linking an organism with its biochemical habitat.
0 Multiple chromosomal rearrangements structured the ancestral vertebrate Hox-bearing protochromosomes. While the proposal that large-scale genome expansions occurred early in vertebrate evolution is widely accepted, the exact mechanisms of the expansion--such as a single or multiple rounds of whole genome duplication, bloc chromosome duplications, large-scale individual gene duplications, or some combination of these--is unclear. Gene families with a single invertebrate member but four vertebrate members, such as the Hox clusters, provided early support for Ohno's hypothesis that two rounds of genome duplication (the 2R-model) occurred in the stem lineage of extant vertebrates. However, despite extensive study, the duplication history of the Hox clusters has remained unclear, calling into question its usefulness in resolving the role of large-scale gene or genome duplications in early vertebrates. Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the vertebrate Hox clusters and several linked genes (the Hox "paralogon") and show that different phylogenies are obtained for Dlx and Col genes than for Hox and ErbB genes. We show that these results are robust to errors in phylogenetic inference and suggest that these competing phylogenies can be resolved if two chromosomal crossover events occurred in the ancestral vertebrate. These results resolve conflicting data on the order of Hox gene duplications and the role of genome duplication in vertebrate evolution and suggest that a period of genome reorganization occurred after genome duplications in early vertebrates.
1 PCR-based rapid genotyping of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. All bacterial genomes contain repetitive sequences which are members of specific DNA families. Such repeats may occur as single units, or found clustered in multiple copies in a head-to-tail configuration at specific loci. The number of clustered units per locus is a strain-defining parameter. Assessing the length variability of clusters of repeats is a versatile typing methodology known as multilocus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an environmental bacterium increasingly involved in nosocomial infections and resistant to most antibiotics. The availability of the whole DNA sequence of the S. maltophilia strain K279a allowed us to set up fast and accurate PCR-based diagnostic protocols based on the measurement of length variations of loci carrying a variable number of short palindromic repeats marking the S. maltophilia genome. On the basis of the amplimers size, it was possible to deduce the number of repeats present at 12 different loci in a collection of S. maltophilia isolates, and therefore label each of them with a digit. PCR-negative regions were labelled 0. Co-amplification of two pairs of loci provided a 4-digit code sufficient for immediate subtyping. By increasing the number of loci analyzed, it should be possible to assign a more specific digit profile to isolates. In general, MLVA data match genotyping data obtained by PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis). However, some isolates exhibiting the same PCR profiles at all loci display distinct PFGE patterns. The utilization of the present protocol allows to type several S. maltophilia isolates in hours. The results are immediately interpretable without the need for sophisticated softwares. The data can be easily reproducible, and compared among different laboratories.
3 Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7: novel vehicles of infection and emergence of phenotypic variants. Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 was only recognized as a human pathogen a little more than a decade ago, yet it has become a major foodborne pathogen. In the United States, the severity of serotype O157:H7 infections in the young and the elderly has had a tremendous impact on human health, the food industry, and federal regulations regarding food safety. The implication of acidic foods as vehicles of infection has dispelled the concept that low-pH foods are safe. Further, the association of nonbovine products with outbreaks suggests that other vehicles of transmission may exist for this pathogen. In laboratory diagnosis, most microbiologic assays rely on a single phenotype to selectively isolate this pathogen. However, the increasing evidence that phenotypic variations exist among isolates in this serogroup may eventually necessitate modifications in assay procedures to detect them.
3 The FF domains of yeast U1 snRNP protein Prp40 mediate interactions with Luc7 and Snu71. The FF domain is conserved across all eukaryotes and usually acts as an adaptor module in RNA metabolism and transcription. Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two FF domain proteins, Prp40, a component of the U1 snRNP, and Ypr152c, a protein of unknown function. The structure of Prp40, its relationship to other proteins within the U1 snRNP, and its precise function remain little understood. Here we have investigated the essentiality and interaction properties of the FF domains of yeast Prp40. We show that the C-terminal two FF domains of Prp40 are dispensable. Deletion of additional FF domains is lethal. The first FF domain of Prp40 binds to U1 protein Luc7 in yeast two-hybrid and GST pulldown experiments. FF domains 2 and 3 bind to Snu71, another known U1 protein. Peptide array screens identified binding sites for FF1-2 within Snu71 (NDVHY) and for FF1 within Luc7 (phi[FHL] x [KR] x [GHL] with phi being a hydrophobic amino acid). Prp40, Luc7, and Snu71 appear to form a subcomplex within the yeast U1snRNP. Our data suggests that the N-terminal FF domains are critical for these interactions. Crystallization of Prp40, Luc7, and Snu71 have failed so far but co-crystallization of pairs or the whole tri-complex may facilitate crystallographic and further functional analysis.
0 Heat shock protein 90: translation from cancer to Alzheimer's disease treatment? Both malignant transformation and neurodegeneration, as it occurs in Alzheimer's disease, are complex and lengthy multistep processes characterized by abnormal expression, post-translational modification, and processing of certain proteins. To maintain and allow the accumulation of these dysregulated processes, and to facilitate the step-wise evolution of the disease phenotype, cells must co-opt a compensatory regulatory mechanism. In cancer, this role has been attributed to heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a molecular chaperone that maintains the functional conformation of multiple proteins involved in cell-specific oncogenic processes. In this sense, at the phenotypic level, Hsp90 appears to serve as a biochemical buffer for the numerous cancer-specific lesions that are characteristic of diverse tumors. The current review proposes a similar role for Hsp90 in neurodegeneration. It will present experimentally demonstrated, but also hypothetical, roles that suggest Hsp90 can act as a regulator of pathogenic changes that lead to the neurodegenerative phenotype in Alzheimer's disease.
1 FDG uptake in PET by bladder hernia simulating inguinal metastasis. A 70-year-old man with past history of hemicolectomy due to colon cancer underwent a follow-up abdominal/pelvic CT scan. CT revealed a right adrenal metastasis and then he underwent FDG-PET/CT study to search for other possible tumor recurrence. In PET images, other than right adrenal gland, there was an unexpected intense FDG uptake at right inguinal region and at first, it was considered to be an inguinal metastasis. However, correlation of PET images to concurrent CT data revealed it to be a bladder herniation. This case provides an example that analysis of PET images without corresponding CT images can lead to an insufficient interpretation or false positive diagnosis. Hence, radiologists should be aware of the importance of a combined analysis of PET and CT data in the interpretation of integrated PET/CT and rare but intriguing conditions, such as bladder herniation, during the evaluation of PET scans in colon cancer patients.
0 The bacterial symbiont Wolbachia induces resistance to RNA viral infections in Drosophila melanogaster. Wolbachia are vertically transmitted, obligatory intracellular bacteria that infect a great number of species of arthropods and nematodes. In insects, they are mainly known for disrupting the reproductive biology of their hosts in order to increase their transmission through the female germline. In Drosophila melanogaster, however, a strong and consistent effect of Wolbachia infection has not been found. Here we report that a bacterial infection renders D. melanogaster more resistant to Drosophila C virus, reducing the load of viruses in infected flies. We identify these resistance-inducing bacteria as Wolbachia. Furthermore, we show that Wolbachia also increases resistance of Drosophila to two other RNA virus infections (Nora virus and Flock House virus) but not to a DNA virus infection (Insect Iridescent Virus 6). These results identify a new major factor regulating D. melanogaster resistance to infection by RNA viruses and contribute to the idea that the response of a host to a particular pathogen also depends on its interactions with other microorganisms. This is also, to our knowledge, the first report of a strong beneficial effect of Wolbachia infection in D. melanogaster. The induced resistance to natural viral pathogens may explain Wolbachia prevalence in natural populations and represents a novel Wolbachia-host interaction.
0 The effect of swimming goggles on intraocular pressure and blood flow within the optic nerve head. Goggles are frequently worn in the sport of swimming and are designed to form a seal around the periorbital tissue orbit. The resultant pressure on the eye may have the potential to affect intraocular pressure and blood flow of the optic nerve head. This study evaluates the influence of wearing swimming goggles on intraocular pressure (IOP) and blood flow of the ocular nerve head (ONH) in normal subjects. Thirty healthy participants took part in this study. The IOP of each participant was measured using a Goldmann tonometer. Measurements were taken immediately before putting on swimming goggles, at 5, 10, 30, and 60 minutes after putting on swimming goggles, and then immediately after taking off the goggles. Blood flow of the ONH was measured using the Heidelberg retinal flowmeter. The average IOP before, during and after wearing the swimming goggles were 11.88 +/- 2.82 mmHg, 14.20 +/- 2.81 mmHg and 11.78 +/- 2.89 mmHg, respectively. The IOP increased immediately after putting on the goggles (p < 0.05) and then returned to normal values immediately after removal (p > 0.05). Blood flow of the ONH was 336.60 +/- 89.07 Arbitrary Units (AU) before and 319.18 +/- 96.02 AU after the goggles were worn (p < 0.05). A small but significant IOP elevation was observed immediately after the swimming goggles were put on. This elevated IOP was maintained while the goggles were kept on, and then returned to normal levels as soon as they were taken off. Blood flow of the ONH did not change significantly throughout the experiment. These facts should be considered for safety concerns, especially in advanced glaucoma patients.
1 Adaptation of the spore discharge mechanism in the basidiomycota. Spore discharge in the majority of the 30,000 described species of Basidiomycota is powered by the rapid motion of a fluid droplet, called Buller's drop, over the spore surface. In basidiomycete yeasts, and phytopathogenic rusts and smuts, spores are discharged directly into the airflow around the fungal colony. Maximum discharge distances of 1-2 mm have been reported for these fungi. In mushroom-forming species, however, spores are propelled over much shorter ranges. In gilled mushrooms, for example, discharge distances of <0.1 mm ensure that spores do not collide with opposing gill surfaces. The way in which the range of the mechanism is controlled has not been studied previously. In this study, we report high-speed video analysis of spore discharge in selected basidiomycetes ranging from yeasts to wood-decay fungi with poroid fruiting bodies. Analysis of these video data and mathematical modeling show that discharge distance is determined by both spore size and the size of the Buller's drop. Furthermore, because the size of Buller's drop is controlled by spore shape, these experiments suggest that seemingly minor changes in spore morphology exert major effects upon discharge distance. This biomechanical analysis of spore discharge mechanisms in mushroom-forming fungi and their relatives is the first of its kind and provides a novel view of the incredible variety of spore morphology that has been catalogued by traditional taxonomists for more than 200 years. Rather than representing non-selected variations in micromorphology, the new experiments show that changes in spore architecture have adaptive significance because they control the distance that the spores are shot through air. For this reason, evolutionary modifications to fruiting body architecture, including changes in gill separation and tube diameter in mushrooms, must be tightly linked to alterations in spore morphology.
3 The relationship between the breast arterial calcification detected by mammography and the hypertensive retinopathy in hypertensive women. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the breast arterial calcification (BAC) detected by mammograms and the hypertensive retinopathy (HR) in hypertensive women who underwent ophthalmologic examination. Screening mammography was performed in 99 hypertensive women and these women also underwent an ophthalmologic examination. The presence of arterial calcification and the number of calcified blood vessels in each breast were evaluated. The grade of HR was determined. The presence of BAC and the number of blood vessels involved was compared according to the presence of HR and the grade of HR. Among the 99 patients, HR was detected in 70 patients, and of these 70 patients, 42 patients had grade I HR and 28 had grade II HR. BAC was detected in 54 cases. Forty-six patients with HR (66%) and eight patients without HR (27%) were diagnosed with BAC after they underwent mammographic examination. The prevalence of BAC in the subjects who had HR was statistically higher than that in those subjects who did not have HR (p < 0.01). The grade of HR was not significantly associated with BAC (p > 0.05). The positive predictive value of the BAC detected on mammography for HR was 0.80 in those subjects who were > or = 60 years old. The detection of BAC by mammography is associated with an increased risk of HR, and particularly for patients after the age of 60. The findings of BAC may be related to hypertensive end-organ damage, and performing mammograms might contribute to predicting the presence of ophthalmologic hypertensive complications in these patients.
2 The value of ultrasound-guided tattooing localization of nonpalpable breast lesions. To investigate the value of ultrasound-guided tattooing localization (US-tattoo) using a charcoal suspension for breast lesions. One hundred sixty-four nonpalpable breast lesions in 134 patients (mean age 47 years; range 30-74 years) were marked with a charcoal suspension under US guidance. The medical records associated with the US-tattoo, the pathology results and the follow-up US results were reviewed. The average size of the localized lesions was 1.0 cm. The procedure time was < 5 minutes (range, 2-10 minutes) per lesion. The US-tattoo was well tolerated in all cases. The only technical difficulty encountered was a needle tip blockage caused by a large charcoal particle (4.9%). The surgeon easily identified the tattoo with the exception one case. In addition, surgery could be safely delayed from one to 57 days after the making US-tattoo. The pathology result was benign in 108 cases, borderline in five, and malignant in 51. The excised specimen was < 4 cm in 76.6% (82/107) of the benign cases (mean; 2.7 cm). The pathologist could identify the mass around the tattoo and was able to make a specific diagnosis in 81.3% (87/107) of benign lesions. The only complication encountered was residual charcoal marking along the incision scar (3.6%). All follow-up US documented the removal of the lesions. An US-tattoo for nonpalpable breast lesions is a very simple and accurate method that can help surgeons design and schedule an open biopsy.
3 New hosts for equine herpesvirus 9. Equine herpesvirus 9 was detected in a polar bear with progressive encephalitis; the source was traced to 2 members of a potential equid reservoir species, Grevy's zebras. The virus was also found in an aborted Persian onager. Thus, the natural host range is extended to 6 species in 3 mammalian orders.
2 Mechanisms of improvement of respiratory failure in patients with COPD treated with NIV. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) improves gas-exchange and symptoms in selected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure. We hypothesized NIV reverses respiratory failure by one or all of increased ventilatory response to carbon-dioxide, reduced respiratory muscle fatigue, or improved pulmonary mechanics. Nineteen stable COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in one second 35% predicted) were studied at baseline (DO), 5-8 days (D5) and 3 months (3M) after starting NIV. Ventilator use was 6.2 (3.7) hours per night at D5 and 3.4 (1.6) at 3M (p = 0.12). Mean (SD) daytime arterial carbon-dioxide tension (PaCO2) was reduced from 7.4 (1.2) kPa to 7.0 (1.1) kPa at D5 and 6.5 (1.1) kPa at 3M (p = 0.001). Total lung capacity decreased from 107 (28) % predicted to 103 (28) at D5 and 103 (27) % predicted at 3M (p = 0.035). At D5 there was an increase in the hypercapnic ventilatory response and some volitional measures of inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, but not isolated diaphragmatic strength whether assessed by volitional or nonvolitional methods. These findings suggest decreased gas trapping and increased ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 are the principal mechanism underlying improvements in gas-exchange in patients with COPD following NIV. Changes in some volitional but not nonvolitional muscle strength measures may reflect improved patient effort.
3 Rarity of TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms in the Korean population. Activation of the innate immune system and chronic low-grade inflammation are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and also thought to be associated with type 2 diabetes and its complications. As a receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide and heat-shock proteins, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is one of the central regulators of the immune response. Recent studies have reported an association between TLR4 polymorphisms and diabetes and its complications in Caucasian populations. In this study, we analyzed the association between TLR4 gene polymorphisms in patients with features of type 2 diabetes and healthy controls in Korea. Two polymorphisms of the TLR4 gene (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) were examined in 225 diabetic patients and 153 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). No Asp299Gly or Thr399Ile mutations were detected in any of the 378 subjects. Seven subjects from each group who had slightly different SSCP patterns were selected for sequencing, but we found no TLR4 polymorphisms on Exon3. The Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile TLR4 gene polymorphisms were absent in both groups, which was similar to the results for Japanese and Chinese Han subjects. Our data and other Asian data suggest that a racial difference can be found in the frequency of the TLR4 polymorphism.
1 Contribution of the C-terminal region within the catalytic core domain of HIV-1 integrase to yeast lethality, chromatin binding and viral replication. HIV-1 integrase (IN) is a key viral enzymatic molecule required for the integration of the viral cDNA into the genome. Additionally, HIV-1 IN has been shown to play important roles in several other steps during the viral life cycle, including reverse transcription, nuclear import and chromatin targeting. Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of HIV-1 IN induces the lethal phenotype in some strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we performed mutagenic analyses of the C-terminal region of the catalytic core domain of HIV-1 IN in order to delineate the critical amino acid(s) and/or motif(s) required for the induction of the lethal phenotype in the yeast strain HP16, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanism which causes this phenotype. Our study identified three HIV-1 IN mutants, V165A, A179P and KR186,7AA, located in the C-terminal region of the catalytic core domain of IN that do not induce the lethal phenotype in yeast. Chromatin binding assays in yeast and mammalian cells demonstrated that these IN mutants were impaired for the ability to bind chromatin. Additionally, we determined that while these IN mutants failed to interact with LEDGF/p75, they retained the ability to bind Integrase interactor 1. Furthermore, we observed that VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 containing these IN mutants was unable to replicate in the C8166 T cell line and this defect was partially rescued by complementation with the catalytically inactive D64E IN mutant. Overall, this study demonstrates that three mutations located in the C-terminal region of the catalytic core domain of HIV-1 IN inhibit the IN-induced lethal phenotype in yeast by inhibiting the binding of IN to the host chromatin. These results demonstrate that the C-terminal region of the catalytic core domain of HIV-1 IN is important for binding to host chromatin and is crucial for both viral replication and the promotion of the IN-induced lethal phenotype in yeast.
3 The extracellular matrix as an adhesion checkpoint for mammary epithelial function. The development of the mammary gland is spatially regulated by the interaction of the mammary epithelium with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Cells receive cues from the ECM through a family of adhesion receptors called integrins, consisting of alpha- and beta-chain dimers. Integrins assist cells in sensing their appropriate developmental context in response to both hormones and growth factors. Here we argue that cell adhesion to the ECM plays a key role in specific developmental checkpoints, particularly in alveolar survival, morphogenesis and function. Specific ablation of alphabeta1-integrins in the luminal epithelium of the mammary gland shows that this sub-type of receptors is required for proliferation, accurate morphological organisation, as well as milk secretion. Downstream, small Rho GTPases mediate cellular polarisation and differentiation. Current challenges in studying the integration of signals in checkpoints of mammary gland development are discussed.
3 Inhalative exposure to vanadium pentoxide causes DNA damage in workers: results of a multiple end point study. Inhalative exposure to vanadium pentoxide (V(2)O(5)) causes lung cancer in rodents. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of V(2)O(5) on DNA stability in workers from a V(2)O(5) factory. We determined DNA strand breaks in leukocytes of 52 workers and controls using the alkaline comet assay. We also investigated different parameters of chromosomal instability in lymphocytes of 23 workers and 24 controls using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (MN) cytome method. Seven of eight biomarkers were increased in blood cells of the workers, and vanadium plasma concentrations in plasma were 7-fold higher than in the controls (0.31 microg/L). We observed no difference in DNA migration under standard conditions, but we found increased tail lengths due to formation of oxidized purines (7%) and pyrimidines (30%) with lesion-specific enzymes (formamidopyrimidine glycosylase and endonuclease III) in the workers. Bleomycin-induced DNA migration was higher in the exposed group (25%), whereas the repair of bleomycin-induced lesions was reduced. Workers had a 2.5-fold higher MN frequency, and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and nuclear buds (Nbuds) were increased 7-fold and 3-fold, respectively. Also, apoptosis and necrosis rates were higher, but only the latter parameter reached statistical significance. V(2)O(5) causes oxidation of DNA bases, affects DNA repair, and induces formation of MNs, NPBs, and Nbuds in blood cells, suggesting that the workers are at increased risk for cancer and other diseases that are related to DNA instability.
1 The relationship between inflammation and new bone formation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Spinal inflammation as detected by magnetic resonance imaging and new bone formation as identified by conventional radiographs are characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. Whether and how spondylitis and syndesmophyte formation are linked are unclear. Our objective was to investigate whether and how spinal inflammation are associated with new bone formation in ankylosing spondylitis. Spinal magnetic resonance images and conventional radiographs from 39 ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents at baseline and after 2 years were analysed for syndesmophyte formation at vertebral edges with or without inflammatory lesions at baseline. Overall, 922 vertebral edges at the cervical and lumbar spine were analysed. At baseline, the proportion of vertebral edges with and without inflammation (magnetic resonance imaging) that showed structural changes (conventional radiographs) was similar (in total, 16.6% of all vertebral edges in 71.4% of patients). From the perspective of syndesmophyte formation (n = 26, 2.9%) after 2 years, there were more vertebral edges without (62%) than with (38%) inflammation at baseline (P = 0.03). From the perspective of spinal inflammation at baseline (n = 153 vertebral edges), more syndesmophytes developed at vertebral edges with (6.5%) than without (2.1%) inflammation (P = 0.002, odds ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 7.4). Inflammation persisted in 31% of the initially inflamed vertebral edges (n = 132), and new lesions developed in 8% of the vertebral edges without inflammation at baseline (n = 410). From the perspective of spinal inflammation after 2 years (n = 72 vertebral edges), 5.6% of the vertebral edges showed syndesmophyte development in contrast to 1.9% of the vertebral edges with new syndesmophytes without inflammation (P = 0.06). These findings obtained in patients treated with anti-TNF agents suggest linkage and some dissociation of inflammation and new bone formation in ankylosing spondylitis. Although syndesmophytes were also found to develop at sites where no inflammation had been seen by magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, it was more likely that syndesmophytes developed in inflamed vertebral edges. More effective suppression of spinal inflammation may be required to inhibit structural damage in ankylosing spondylitis.
1 More on direct estimates of low-level radiation risks. In an epidemiologic study of mortality at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) found no evidence of excess deaths due to leukemia or other cancers among workers exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation [1]. In a subsequent analysis, Bross and Driscoll [2] identified excess lung cancer mortality in PNS workers with lifetime radiation dose of 1 rem or greater and with more than 15 years' latency since first radiation exposure. Although that observation may be important and is currently being examined through case-control analyses, it must be recognized that Bross and Driscoll extracted their observation from matrices of over 4,000 data cells apparently by recombination of innumerable possible permutations of dosage and latency intervals. For that reason, their finding can be regarded as no more than a suggestion for further study. It certainly does not represent a proper scientific conclusion. Bross and Driscoll's analysis illustrates the hazard of performing multiple statistical comparisons on complex data sets in the absence of a priori hypotheses.
0 Olig2-induced neural stem cell differentiation involves downregulation of Wnt signaling and induction of Dickkopf-1 expression. Understanding stem cell-differentiation at the molecular level is important for clinical applications of stem cells and for finding new therapeutic approaches in the context of cancer stem cells. To investigate genome-wide changes involved in differentiation, we have used immortalized neural stem cell (NSC) line (HB1.F3) and Olig2-induced NSC differentiation model (F3.Olig2). Using microarray analysis, we revealed that Olig2-induced NSC differentiation involves downregulation of Wnt pathway, which was further confirmed by TOPflash/FOPflash reporter assay, RT-PCR analysis, immunoblots, and immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, we found that Olig2-induced differentiation induces the expression of Dickkopf-1(Dkk1), a potent antagonist of Wnt signaling. Dkk1 treatment blocked Wnt signaling in HB1.F3 in a dosage-dependent manner, and induced differentiation into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Our results support cancer stem cell hypothesis which implies that signaling pathway for self-renewal and proliferation of stem cells is maintained till the late stage of differentiation. In our proposed model, Dkk1 may play an important role in downregulating self-renewal and proliferation pathway of stem cells at the late stage of differentiation, and its failure may lead to carcinogenesis.
3 The effect of insecticide synergists on the response of scabies mites to pyrethroid acaricides. Permethrin is the active component of topical creams widely used to treat human scabies. Recent evidence has demonstrated that scabies mites are becoming increasingly tolerant to topical permethrin and oral ivermectin. An effective approach to manage pesticide resistance is the addition of synergists to counteract metabolic resistance. Synergists are also useful for laboratory investigation of resistance mechanisms through their ability to inhibit specific metabolic pathways. To determine the role of metabolic degradation as a mechanism for acaricide resistance in scabies mites, PBO (piperonyl butoxide), DEF (S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate) and DEM (diethyl maleate) were first tested for synergistic activity with permethrin in a bioassay of mite killing. Then, to investigate the relative role of specific metabolic pathways inhibited by these synergists, enzyme assays were developed to measure esterase, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (cytochrome P450) activity in mite extracts. A statistically significant difference in median survival time of permethrin-resistant Sarcoptes scabiei variety canis was noted when any of the three synergists were used in combination with permethrin compared to median survival time of mites exposed to permethrin alone (p<0.0001). Incubation of mite homogenates with DEF showed inhibition of esterase activity (37%); inhibition of GST activity (73%) with DEM and inhibition of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity (81%) with PBO. A 7-fold increase in esterase activity, a 4-fold increase in GST activity and a 2-fold increase in cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity were observed in resistant mites compared to sensitive mites. These findings indicate the potential utility of synergists in reversing resistance to pyrethroid-based acaricides and suggest a significant role of metabolic mechanisms in mediating pyrethroid resistance in scabies mites.
3 Deranged tyrosine metabolism in cirrhosis. In normal individuals, the main route for tyrosine degradation is the hepatic pathway tyrosine→4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid→homogentisic acid→CO(2). Quantitatively minor pathways, in large part extrahepatic, are: tyrosine→tyramine→octopamine and tyrosine→dopa→catecholamines.In cirrhosis, the main hepatic pathway is blocked to varying degrees at the first three stages. This appears to be due to lack of activity of the enzymes tyrosine transaminase, PHPA oxidase, and HGA oxidase, the first step being rate limiting. Hypertyrosinemia and tyrosine intolerance result.With the main hepatic pathway partially blocked, an abnormally large amount of tyrosine passes into the normally minor extrahepatic pathway leading to the false neurotransmitters tyramine and octopamine. Overproduction of these amines ensues and they accumulate in the body fluid.The false neurotransmitters can displace catecholamines from their storage sites in the peripheral and central nervous system, and thereby disrupt adrenergic processes in arterioles, kidneys, and brain. Their accumulation in cirrhotic patients may play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and hyperdynamic circulation.
1 Vancomycin-resistant enterococci outbreak, Germany, and calculation of outbreak start. On the basis of a large outbreak of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in a German university hospital, we estimated costs ( approximately 1 million Euros) that could have been avoided by early detection of the imminent outbreak. For this purpose, we demonstrate an easy-to-use statistical method.
2 Pacemaker patients' perception of unsafe activities: a survey. Cardiac pacing is a recognized and widely used treatment for patients presenting with bradycardia. Physicians expect patients to return to normal activities almost immediately post implantation. However, patients themselves may perceive interference to pacemaker function by various routine activities and devices, and hence continue to lead restricted, disabled lives. The aim of this study is to determine if routine activities are perceived by pacemaker patients to interfere with their device function. A descriptive cross sectional survey was carried out on consecutive patients at the pacemaker clinic at a public hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. A 47-question tool was developed and tested. Patients' perceptions of safety of performing various routine activities, along with socio-demographic data were recorded. The final sample included 93 adult patients (45% males). 41% were illiterate. 77.4% recalled receiving counselling at implantation, predominantly from the implanting physician and house staff. A considerable proportion of patients considered many routine activities unsafe including driving automobiles (28%), passing through metal detectors (31%), bending over (37%), and sleeping on the side of the pacemaker (30%). Also considered unsafe were operation of household appliances--TV/VCR (television/video cassette recorders) (53%), irons (55%)) and electrical wall switches (56%). For nearly all variables neither literacy nor history of counselling improved incorrect perceptions. This study shows that our pacemaker patients perceive many routine activities as unsafe, potentially leading to disabling life style modifications. The tremendous investment in pacemaker technology to improve patient performance is not going to pay dividends if patients continue to remain disabled due to incorrect perceptions. Further studies are required to determine the reasons for these misperceptions, and to determine if these problems also exist in, and hinder, other patient populations.
1 Spatial analysis of tuberculosis cases in migrants and permanent residents, Beijing, 2000-2006. To determine the role of the migrant population in the transmission of tuberculosis (TB), we investigated the distribution and magnitude of TB in permanent residents and migrant populations of Beijing, People's Republic of China, from 2000 through 2006. An exploratory spatial data analysis was applied to detect the "hot spots" of TB among the 2 populations. Results, using the data obtained from 2004-2006, showed that people who migrated from the western, middle, and eastern zones of China had a significantly higher risk of having TB than did permanent residents. These findings indicate that population fluctuations have affected the rate of TB prevalence in Beijing, and interventions to control TB should include the migrant population.
0 Protein evolution in deep sea bacteria: an analysis of amino acids substitution rates. Abyssal microorganisms have evolved particular features that enable them to grow in their extreme habitat. Genes belonging to specific functional categories are known to be particularly susceptible to high-pressure; therefore, they should show some evidence of positive selection. To verify this hypothesis we computed the amino acid substitution rates between two deep-sea microorganisms, Photobacterium profundum SS9 and Shewanella benthica KT99, and their respective shallow water relatives. A statistical analysis of all the orthologs, led to the identification of positive selected (PS) genes, which were then used to evaluate adaptation strategies. We were able to establish "Motility" and "Transport" as two classes significantly enriched with PS genes. The prevalence of transporters led us to analyze variable amino acids (PS sites) by mapping them according to their membrane topology, the results showed a higher frequency of substitutions in the extra-cellular compartment. A similar analysis was performed on soluble proteins, mapping the PS sites on the 3D structure, revealing a prevalence of substitutions on the protein surface. Finally, the presence of some flagellar proteins in the Vibrionaceae PS list confirms the importance of bacterial motility as a SS9 specific adaptation strategy. The approach presented in this paper is suitable for identifying molecular adaptations to particular environmental conditions. The statistical method takes into account differences in the ratio between non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, thus allowing the detection of the genes that underwent positive selection. We found that positive selection in deep-sea adapted bacteria targets a wide range of functions, for example solute transport, protein translocation, DNA synthesis and motility. From these data clearly emerges an involvement of the transport and metabolism processes in the deep-sea adaptation strategy of both bathytypes considered, whereas the adaptation of other biological processes seems to be specific to either one or the other. An important role is hypothesized for five PS genes belonging to the transport category that had been previously identified as differentially expressed in microarray experiments. Strikingly, structural mapping of PS sites performed independently on membrane and soluble proteins revealed that residues under positive selection tend to occur in specific protein regions.
3 Rickettsial Seroepidemiology among farm workers, Tianjin, People's Republic of China. High seroprevalence rates for Anaplasma phagocytophilum (8.8%), Coxiella burnetii (6.4%), Bartonella henselae (9.6%), and Rickettsia typhi (4.1%) in 365 farm workers near Tianjin, People's Republic of China, suggest that human infections with these zoonotic bacteria are frequent and largely unrecognized. Demographic features of seropositive persons suggest distinct epidemiology, ecology, and risks.
3 Evidence against bicarbonate reabsorption in the ascending limb, particularly as disclosed by free-water clearance studies. Bicarbonate reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop was examined by studies of free-water clearance (CH2O) and free-water reabsorption (TcH2O). During maximal water diuresis in the dog, CH2O/GFR was taken as an indes of sodium reabsorption in, and urine flow (V/GFR) as an index of delivery of filtrate to, this scarbonate, infusion of a nonreabsorbable solute (hypotonic mannitol) and administration of an inhibitor of bicarbonate reabsorption (acetaent, but less than that achieved with hypotonic saline infusion. This suggests that sodium that sodium bicarbonate is not reabsorbed in the ascending limb. Rather, it is the sodium chloride, swept out of the proximal tubule by osmotic diuresis due to nonreabsorbed mannitol or sodium bicarbonate, that is reabsorbed in the ascending limb thereby increasing CH2O, whereas the nonreabsorption of mannitol and sodium bicarbonate results in a depressed CH20 per unit V when compared with hypotonic saline. V/GFR is not a satisfactory index of delivery to the ascending limb during osmotic diuresis, since it includes water obligated by nonreabsorbable solutes. When a better index of delivery, the sum of the clearances of chloride (CC1) and free-water (CH2O) is used, hypotonic bicarbonate infusion, hypotonic mannitol infusion and acetazolamide administration increase CH2O/GFR per unit delivery to the same extent as odes hypotonic saline infusion. Studies in dogs and rats on TcH2O also indicate that sodium bicarbonate is an impermeant solute in the ascending limb. Osmotic diuresis due to sodium bicarbonate diuresis, produced either by inhibition of sodium bicarbonate reabsorption (acetazolamide, L-lysine mono-hydrochloride) or infusion of sodium bicarbonate, or mannitol diuresis both produced marked chloruresis and increased TcH2O to the same extent as did hypertonic saline infusion. If chloride excretion was almost eliminated by hemodialysis against a chloride-free dialysate (dogs) or prolonged feeding of a salt-free diet (rats), TcH2O formation was unimpaired if hypertonic saline was infused but virtually obliterated during mannitol or sodium bicarbonate diuresis. Sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb, therefore, appears to be dependent upon chloride as the accompanying anion. At any given rate of bicarbonate excretion, more cloride is delivered out of the proximal tubule (as estimated from CC1 + CH2O) with hypotonic sodium bicarbonate infusion than with acetazolamide administration. This suggests that magnitude of the chlorutesis accompanying bicarbonate diuresis depends, not only on osmotic diuresis due to nonreabsorbed sodium bicarbonate, but also on the extent to which concomitant changes in effective extracellular volume influence overall sodium chloride reabsorption.
0 Intellectual development in children whose mothers received propylthiouracil during pregnancy. Standard intelligence tests were administered to twenty-eight children who had been exposed to PTU in utero and thirty-two non-exposed siblings. There was no significant difference in results between the two groups. The present study suggests that with careful attention, pregnant women with thyrotoxicosis can be treated with propylthiouracil without interfering with subsequent intellectual development in the offspring.
3 Invasive bacterial diseases in northern Canada. International Circumpolar Surveillance (ICS) is a population-based invasive bacterial disease surveillance network. Participating Canadian regions include Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and northern regions of Québec and Labrador (total population 132,956, 59% aboriginal). Clinical and demographic information were collected by using standardized surveillance forms. Bacterial isolates were forwarded to reference laboratories for confirmation and serotyping. After pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction, crude annual incidence rates of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae decreased from 34.0/100,000 population (1999-2002) to 23.6/100,000 population (2003-2005); substantial reductions were shown among aboriginals. However, incidence rates of S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and group A streptococci were higher in aboriginal populations than in non-aboriginal populations. H. influenzae type b was rare; 52% of all H. influenzae cases were caused by type a. Data collected by ICS contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of invasive bacterial diseases among northern populations, which assists in formulation of prevention and control strategies, including immunization recommendations.
3 Case management used to optimize cancer care pathways: a systematic review. Reports of inadequate cancer patient care have given rise to various interventions to support cancer care pathways which, overall, seem poorly studied. Case management (CM) is one method that may support a cost-effective, high-quality patient-centred treatment and care.The purpose of this article was to summarise intervention characteristics, outcomes of interest, results, and validity components of the published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining CM as a method for optimizing cancer care pathways. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched for RCTs published all years up to August 2008. Identified papers were included if they passed the following standards. 1) The intervention should meet the criteria for CM which includes multidisciplinary collaboration, care co-ordination, and it should include in-person meetings between patient and the case manager aimed at supporting, informing and educating the patient. 2) The intervention should focus on cancer patient care. 3) The intervention should aim to improve subjective or objective quality outcomes, and effects should be reported in the paper. Studies centred on cancer screening or palliative cancer care.Data extraction was conducted in order to obtain a descriptive overview of intervention characteristics, outcomes of interest and findings. Elements of CONSORT guidelines and checklists were used to assess aspects of study validity. The searches identified 654 unique papers, of which 25 were retrieved for scrutiny. Seven papers were finally included. Intervention characteristics, outcomes studied, findings and methodological aspects were all very diverse. Due to the scarcity of papers included (seven), significant heterogeneity in target group, intervention setting, outcomes measured and methodologies applied, no conclusions can be drawn about the effect of CM on cancer patient care.It is a major challenge that CM shrouds in a "black box", which means that it is difficult to determine which aspect(s) of interventions contribute to overall effects. More trials on rigorously developed CM interventions (opening up the "black box") are needed as is the re-testing of interventions and outcomes studied in various settings.
0 Gaze strategy in the free flying zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Fast moving animals depend on cues derived from the optic flow on their retina. Optic flow from translational locomotion includes information about the three-dimensional composition of the environment, while optic flow experienced during a rotational self motion does not. Thus, a saccadic gaze strategy that segregates rotations from translational movements during locomotion will facilitate extraction of spatial information from the visual input. We analysed whether birds use such a strategy by highspeed video recording zebra finches from two directions during an obstacle avoidance task. Each frame of the recording was examined to derive position and orientation of the beak in three-dimensional space. The data show that in all flights the head orientation was shifted in a saccadic fashion and was kept straight between saccades. Therefore, birds use a gaze strategy that actively stabilizes their gaze during translation to simplify optic flow based navigation. This is the first evidence of birds actively optimizing optic flow during flight.
0 Ectopic Cushing's syndrome in cloacogenic carcinoma of the anal canal: a case demonstrating APUD characteristics. A patient found to have ectopic Cushing's syndrome three months after surgical resection of cloacogenic carcinoma of the anal canal was studied with serial plasma cortisol and ACTH measurements. The effects of therapy on plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were noted. An autopsy was performed immediately after death and liver metastatic tumor tissue was assayed for "small" ACTH, "big" ACTH, PTH, and alpha sub-unit of hCG, Clinical Cushing's syndrome was observed along with nonsuppressible plasma cortisol level. Plasma ACTH only reached the highest normal level but tumor ACTH ("small"), "big" ACTH, alpha sub-unit and PTH were markedly elevated. It was concluded that a case of classic cloacogenic carcinoma of the anal canal produced ectopic Cushing's syndrome. Elevated tumor alpha sub-unit and PTH were not associated with appreciable biologic activity. Ectopic Cushing's syndrome in this disease may imply poorer prognosis.
3 Does ATP cross the cell plasma membrane. Although there is an abundance of evidence which indicates that ATP is released as well as taken up by cells, the concept that ATP cannot cross the cell membrane has tended to prevail. This article reviews the evidence for the release as well as uptake of ATP by cells. The evidence presented by various investigators clearly indicates that ATP can cross the cell membrane and suggests that the release and uptake of ATP are physiological processes.
0 An upstream open reading frame controls translation of var2csa, a gene implicated in placental malaria. Malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is responsible for substantial morbidity, mortality and economic losses in tropical regions of the world. Pregnant women are exceptionally vulnerable to severe consequences of the infection, due to the specific adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a unique variant of PfEMP1, a parasite encoded, hyper-variable antigen placed on the surface of infected cells. This variant, called VAR2CSA, binds to chondroitin sulfate A on syncytiotrophoblasts in the intervillous space of placentas. VAR2CSA appears to only be expressed in the presence of a placenta, suggesting that its expression is actively repressed in men, children or non-pregnant women; however, the mechanism of repression is not understood. Using cultured parasite lines and reporter gene constructs, we show that the gene encoding VAR2CSA contains a small upstream open reading frame that acts to repress translation of the resulting mRNA, revealing a novel form of gene regulation in malaria parasites. The mechanism underlying this translational repression is reversible, allowing high levels of protein translation upon selection, thus potentially enabling parasites to upregulate expression of this variant antigen in the presence of the appropriate host tissue.
0 Sexually antagonistic "zygotic drive" of the sex chromosomes. Genomic conflict is perplexing because it causes the fitness of a species to decline rather than improve. Many diverse forms of genomic conflict have been identified, but this extant tally may be incomplete. Here, we show that the unusual characteristics of the sex chromosomes can, in principle, lead to a previously unappreciated form of sexual genomic conflict. The phenomenon occurs because there is selection in the heterogametic sex for sex-linked mutations that harm the sex of offspring that does not carry them, whenever there is competition among siblings. This harmful phenotype can be expressed as an antagonistic green-beard effect that is mediated by epigenetic parental effects, parental investment, and/or interactions among siblings. We call this form of genomic conflict sexually antagonistic "zygotic drive", because it is functionally equivalent to meiotic drive, except that it operates during the zygotic and postzygotic stages of the life cycle rather than the meiotic and gametic stages. A combination of mathematical modeling and a survey of empirical studies is used to show that sexually antagonistic zygotic drive is feasible, likely to be widespread in nature, and that it can promote a genetic "arms race" between the homo- and heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This new category of genomic conflict has the potential to strongly influence other fundamental evolutionary processes, such as speciation and the degeneration of the Y and W sex chromosomes. It also fosters a new genetic hypothesis for the evolution of enigmatic fitness-reducing traits like the high frequency of spontaneous abortion, sterility, and homosexuality observed in humans.
3 Forest fragmentation as cause of bacterial transmission among nonhuman primates, humans, and livestock, Uganda. We conducted a prospective study of bacterial transmission among humans, nonhuman primates (primates hereafter), and livestock in western Uganda. Humans living near forest fragments harbored Escherichia coli bacteria that were approximately 75% more similar to bacteria from primates in those fragments than to bacteria from primates in nearby undisturbed forests. Genetic similarity between human/livestock and primate bacteria increased approximately 3-fold as anthropogenic disturbance within forest fragments increased from moderate to high. Bacteria harbored by humans and livestock were approximately twice as similar to those of red-tailed guenons, which habitually enter human settlements to raid crops, than to bacteria of other primate species. Tending livestock, experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms, and residing near a disturbed forest fragment increased genetic similarity between a participant's bacteria and those of nearby primates. Forest fragmentation, anthropogenic disturbance within fragments, primate ecology, and human behavior all influence bidirectional, interspecific bacterial transmission. Targeted interventions on any of these levels should reduce disease transmission and emergence.
0 AIDS patient death caused by novel Cryptococcus neoformans x C. gattii hybrid. Interspecies hybrids of Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii have only recently been reported. We describe a novel C. neoformans x C. gattii hybrid strain (serotype AB) that was previously described as C. gattii and that caused a lethal infection in an AIDS patient from Canada.
1 Ceftriaxone-resistant salmonella enterica serotype Newport, France. The multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serotype Newport strain that produces CMY-2 beta-lactamase (Newport MDR-AmpC) was the source of sporadic cases and outbreaks in humans in France during 2000-2005. Because this strain was not detected in food animals, it was most likely introduced into France through imported food products.
2 Vaccine control of poliomyelitis in the 1980s. The main challenge of vaccine control of poliomyelitis in the 1980s is in the subtropical and tropical regions of the world where "lameness" surveys in recent years have shown how very high the average annual incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis can be in both rural and urban areas in the absence of epidemics. The procedures by which oral polio vaccine (OPV) rapidly eliminated all or almost all paralytic disease caused by polioviruses from the economically developed temperate climate countries have been inadequate in tropical and subtropical countries, except in some small countries with good health services, largely because there is much more year-round circulation of "wild" polioviruses which continue to produce the disease in the unvaccinated and incompletely vaccinated children. Not even a cheap, hypothetically 100 percent effective, one-dose vaccine could eliminate poliomyelitis in the tropics if, for a variety of reasons, it would reach only a portion of the infant population. Paralytic disease caused by polioviruses has been quickly eliminated from both small and large tropical countries by OPV in well-organized programs of annual mass vaccinations of almost all children under a certain age.
3 Effect of TNF-alpha on human ARPE-19-secreted proteins. To identify cytokine-induced changes in the secretome of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and their potential implication in age-related macular degeneration pathogenesis. Stable isotope labeling by amino in cell culture (SILAC) was used in combination with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure differential protein secretion from tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) treated ARPE-19 versus untreated ARPE-19 cells. Typically, one set of cells was subcultured in a medium in which Arg and Lys were replaced by (13)C(6)-Arg and (15)N(2,) (13)C(6)-Lys while the other set of cells was grown in unlabeled medium. The fully labeled cells were then treated with TNF-alpha, while unlabeled cells were left untreated. Spent media from both treated and untreated cells were collected, mixed at 1:1 ratio, and processed for LC-MS/MS analysis. Labeled and unlabeled peptide pairs were identified and their intensities were used to determine protein ratios in TNF-alpha treated cells versus untreated cells. To validate the data, we performed a reverse experiment in which unlabeled cells were treated with TNF-alpha while labeled cells were kept untreated. A total of 146 proteins were identified as putatively secreted proteins in the spent medium of ARPE-19 cells and only six among these were differentially secreted following TNF-alpha treatment. Secretion of complement 3 and sulfhydryl oxidase-1 was increased by twofold, fibronectin by 1.7 fold, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 by 1.9 fold and syndecan-4 by 4.35 fold while secretion of trans-golgi network protein-2 was decreased by twofold. TNF-alpha modulates secretion of specific proteins in ARPE-19 cells. These proteins are involved in pathways relevant to AMD pathogenesis (e.g., extracellular matrix remodeling, complement pathway, and angiogenesis).
3 Hepatic heme metabolism and its control. This review summarizes heme metabolism and focuses especially upon the control of hepatic heme biosynthesis. Activity of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase, the first enzyme of heme biosynthesis, is of primary importance in controlling the overall activity of this biosynthetic pathway. Δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase is subject to inhibition and repression by heme, and numerous basic and clinical studies support the concept that there exists within hepatocytes a "regulatory" heme pool which controls activity of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase. In addition, activity of this enzyme is repressed by feeding, especially by ingestion of carbohydrates (the so-called "glucose effect"). Studies pertaining to the mechanisms underlying this effect are also reviewed. The "glucose effect" appears to be mediated by glucose or perhaps by glucose-6-phosphate or uridine diphosphate glucose, rather than by metabolites further removed from glucose itself. Unlike the situation in E. coli, the "glucose effect" in liver of higher organisms is not mediated by alterations in intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP. Effects of heavy metals, especially iron, on hepatic heme metabolism are also considered. Iron has been found to inhibit formation and utilization of uroporphyrinogen III and to lead to decreased concentrations of microsomal heme and cytochrome P-450. Administration of large amounts of iron is also associated with an increase in activity of heme oxygenase, a property shared by several other metal ions, most notably cobalt. This effect of iron or cobalt administration is similar to the effect of heme administration in increasing heme oxygenase activity; however, we believe it is unlikely that iron, rather than heme itself, is a physiologic regulator of hepatic heme metabolism, although this hypothesis has lately been proposed.
2 Uptake of HIV and syphilis testing of pregnant women and their male partners in a programme for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission in Uganda. To describe uptake of HIV and syphilis testing in a prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission programme in Uganda. Analysis of data from routine HIV and syphilis testing at Entebbe Hospital antenatal services. A total of 20,738 women attended antenatal services. Exactly 62.8% of women, but only 1.8% of their male partners, accepted testing for HIV; 82.2% of women, but only 1.1% of their male partners accepted syphilis testing. Partners of women with positive HIV results were more likely to come for subsequent testing. Of 200 couples whose partners accepted HIV-testing within 30 days of one another, 19 (9.5%) were HIV-discordant, representing 65.5% of couples with at least one partner HIV-positive. HIV prevalence was 12.6% for women and 10.8% for men; syphilis prevalence was 4.0% for women and 6.2% for men. Uptake of HIV and syphilis testing was fairly good among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at Entebbe Hospital, but very low among their male partners. The level of HIV-discordant couples was high. These clinics should be made more couples-friendly to identify both HIV-positive men for treatment and discordant couples for HIV prevention.
2 Relationship between serum albumin and pulse wave velocity in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Hypoalbuminemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality in dialysis patients, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Meanwhile, increased pulse wave velocity (PWV), the marker of arterial stiffness, has been proved to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. The relationship between serum albumin and PWV in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients (CAPD) was studied. Sixty-two CAPD patients were studied. The average age was 63 +/- 12 years and dialysis duration was 23 +/- 22 months. Serum albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotidfemoral PWV were measured. Among these patients, 43.5% were men. The mean serum albumin concentration was 37 +/- 4 g/L and PWV was 11.9 +/- 2.3 m/s. PWV positively correlated with age (r = 0.35, P < 0.01), diabetes (yes=1, no=0; r = 0.292, P < 0.05), systolic blood pressure (SBP; r = 0.493, P < 0.001) and CRP (r = 0.295, P < 0.05), but negatively correlated with serum albumin (r = -0.357, P < 0.01). In multiple regression analysis, SBP (beta = 0.615, P < 0.001), age (beta = 0.414, P < 0.01), albumin (beta = -0.315, P < 0.05) and total cholesterol (beta = 0.275, P < 0.05) were independent determinants of PWV. In a non-inflamed subgroup (CRP < 3 mg/L, n=30), albumin still negatively correlated with PWV (r = -0.66, P < 0.001). Serum albumin inversely correlated with increased PWV in CAPD patients, suggesting that increased arterial stiffness might be the link between hypoalbuminemia and increased cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients.
2 Year in review 2007: Critical Care--shock. The research papers on shock published in Critical Care throughout 2007 are related to three major subjects: the modulation of the macrocirculation and microcirculation during shock, focusing on arginine vasopressin, erythropoietin and nitric oxide; studies on metabolic homeostasis (acid-base status, energy expenditure and gastrointestinal motility); and basic supportive measures in critical illness (fluid resuscitation and sedation, and body-temperature management). The present review summarizes the key results of these studies and provides a brief discussion in the context of the relevant scientific and clinical background.
2 Apocynin: molecular aptitudes. Apocynin is a naturally occurring methoxy-substituted catechol, experimentally used as an inhibitor of NADPH-oxidase. It can decrease the production of superoxide (O(2)(-)) from activated neutrophils and macrophages while the ability of phagocytosis remains unaffected. The anti-inflammatory activity of apocynin has been demonstrated in a variety of cell and animal models of inflammation. Apocynin, after metabolic conversion, inhibits the assembly of NADPH-oxidase that is responsible for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It is, therefore, extensively used to reveal the role of this enzyme in cell and experimental models. Although some of the ROS serve as signaling molecules in the cells, excessive production is damaging and has been implicated to play an important role in the progression of many disease processes. This is why in many studies apocynin presents a promising potential treatment for some disorders; however, its utility with inflammatory diseases remains to be determined. Since its mode of action is not well defined, we tried to get a more precise insight into the mechanisms by which apocynin exerts its activity. Considering the anti-inflammatory activities of apocynin, we may conclude that this compound definitely deserves further study.
1 Imputation methods for missing outcome data in meta-analysis of clinical trials. Missing outcome data from randomized trials lead to greater uncertainty and possible bias in estimating the effect of an experimental treatment. An intention-to-treat analysis should take account of all randomized participants even if they have missing observations. To review and develop imputation methods for missing outcome data in meta-analysis of clinical trials with binary outcomes. We review some common strategies, such as simple imputation of positive or negative outcomes, and develop a general approach involving ;informative missingness odds ratios' (IMORs). We describe several choices for weighting studies in the meta-analysis, and illustrate methods using a meta-analysis of trials of haloperidol for schizophrenia. IMORs describe the relationship between the unknown risk among missing participants and the known risk among observed participants. They are allowed to differ between treatment groups and across trials. Application of IMORs and other methods to the haloperidol trials reveals the overall conclusion to be robust to different assumptions about the missing data. The methods are based on summary data from each trial (number of observed positive outcomes, number of observed negative outcomes and number of missing outcomes) for each intervention group. This limits the options for analysis, and greater flexibility would be available with individual participant data. We propose that available reasons for missingness be used to determine appropriate IMORs. We also recommend a strategy for undertaking sensitivity analyses, in which the IMORs are varied over plausible ranges.
3 Epidemiology of group A streptococcal infections--their changing frequency and severity. The frequency and severity of streptococcal infections and their sequelae have declined dramatically in the past century, yet the prevalence of streptococcal infections is still high. The reasons for this decline must be intimately related to host resistance, virulence of the agent, and environmental factors, especially crowding. Close examination of these fundamental influences does not reveal any evidence that humans have become less resistant to streptococcal infections, but they react less violently. There is some evidence that the agent may have lost a degree of its virulence. The decline in morbidity and mortality due to streptococcal infections began long before antibiotics, especially penicillin, were available. However, penicillin has proved to be an important factor in prevention of streptococcal infections, especially in rheumatic fever prophylaxis. There are certain indications that repeated streptococcal infections due to similar M types, occurring in young children over the past several decades, have resulted in some degree of immunity as well as the possible evolution of less virulent, but not less infectious, strains of group A streptococci. Also, a decrease in crowding would be expected to result in fewer streptococcal infections. Although there are more people in the world than at any other time in the history of man, urban population density in the western world, at least, is less than in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
1 Underreported threat of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Africa. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in Africa may be more prevalent than previously appreciated. Factors leading to development of drug resistance need to be understood to develop appropriate control strategies for national programs. We gathered estimates of MDR TB rates for 39 of 46 countries in Africa. The relationship between MDR TB rates and independent factors was analyzed by using correlation and linear regression models. Our findings indicate that drug resistance surveys in Africa are critically needed. MDR TB rates must be assessed in countries without these surveys. In countries that have conducted a drug resistance survey, a new survey will determine evolution of drug resistance rates. We found no correlation between high MDR rates and TB incidence, HIV/TB co-infection rates, or year of introduction of rifampin. Results show that the retreatment failure rate was the most predictive indicator for MDR TB. Current category II drug regimens may increase MDR TB.
3 Non-natural and photo-reactive amino acids as biochemical probes of immune function. Wilms tumor protein (WT1) is a transcription factor selectively overexpressed in leukemias and cancers; clinical trials are underway that use altered WT1 peptide sequences as vaccines. Here we report a strategy to study peptide-MHC interactions by incorporating non-natural and photo-reactive amino acids into the sequence of WT1 peptides. Thirteen WT1 peptides sequences were synthesized with chemically modified amino acids (via fluorination and photo-reactive group additions) at MHC and T cell receptor binding positions. Certain new non-natural peptide analogs could stabilize MHC class I molecules better than the native sequences and were also able to elicit specific T-cell responses and sometimes cytotoxicity to leukemia cells. Two photo-reactive peptides, also modified with a biotin handle for pull-down studies, formed covalent interactions with MHC molecules on live cells and provided kinetic data showing the rapid clearance of the peptide-MHC complex. Despite "infinite affinity" provided by the covalent peptide bonding to the MHC, immunogenicity was not enhanced by these peptides because the peptide presentation on the surface was dominated by catabolism of the complex and only a small percentage of peptide molecules covalently bound to the MHC molecules. This study shows that non-natural amino acids can be successfully incorporated into T cell epitopes to provide novel immunological, biochemical and kinetic information.
1 The responsiveness of the uterine fibroid symptom and health-related quality of life questionnaire (UFS-QOL). A number of noninvasive alternatives to hysterectomy have become available as treatments for uterine fibroids. These alternative therapies, however, may not relieve all symptoms. Consequently, the need for patient-reported outcomes to assess symptom reduction of uterine fibroids has become increasingly important to evaluate the clinical success of patients who choose these alternative therapies. The purpose of the study was to examine the responsiveness of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QOL) with treatment of uterine fibroids. The responsiveness of the UFS-QOL was assessed as a post-hoc analysis of patients treated with MRI-guided focused ultrasound thermal ablation (MRgFUS) for uterine fibroids. The UFS-QOL and SF-36 were completed at baseline and months 1, 3, and 6. Patient perceived overall treatment effect (OTE) was assessed at month 3, while satisfaction with treatment was collected at month 6. The responsiveness of the UFS-QOL was examined using effect sizes and change scores by patient-reported overall treatment effect and satisfaction. A total of 102 women with complete UFS-QOL data were included in the analysis; the mean age was 45 years and 79% were Caucasian. From baseline to 6 months, significant improvements were observed in UFS-QOL Symptom Severity and all Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) subscale scores (p < 0.0001). When examining change in general health status over the 6-month follow-up period, significant improvements were noted in all 8 SF-36 subscales. The UFS-QOL was highly responsive with subscale effect sizes ranging from 0.74 for Sexual Function to -1.9 for Symptom Severity. Improvements in UFS-QOL subscales were associated with patient perceptions of perceived benefit and treatment satisfaction. The UFS-QOL is responsive to treatment for uterine fibroids and is a useful outcome measure for uterine-sparing uterine fibroid treatments.
1 Wnts acting through canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways exert opposite effects on hippocampal synapse formation. Wnt proteins comprise a large class of signaling molecules that regulate a variety of developmental processes, including synapse formation. Previous studies have shown Wnts to be involved in both the induction and prevention of synapses in a number of different organisms. However, it is not clear whether the influence of Wnts on synapses is a result of Wnts' behavior in different organisms or differences in the activity of different Wnt ligands. We used in situ hybridization to show that several Wnt ligands (Wnt3, Wnt5a, Wnt7a, and Wnt7b) and their receptors, Frizzled, are expressed in the developing hippocampus during the period of synapse formation in rodents. We used recombinant Wnt protein or Wnt conditioned media to explore the effects of Wnts on synapses in hippocampal cultures. We found that Wnt7a and Wnt7b activate canonical signaling, whereas Wnt5a activates a noncanonical pathway. The activation of the canonical pathway, either through pathway manipulations or through Wnt stimulation, increases presynaptic inputs. In contrast, exposure to Wnt5a, which activates a noncanonical signaling pathway, decreases the number of presynaptic terminals. Our observations suggest that the pro- and antisynaptogenic effects of Wnt proteins are associated with the activation of the canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways.
3 Protein kinase CK2 contributes to the organization of sodium channels in axonal membranes by regulating their interactions with ankyrin G. In neurons, generation and propagation of action potentials requires the precise accumulation of sodium channels at the axonal initial segment (AIS) and in the nodes of Ranvier through ankyrin G scaffolding. We found that the ankyrin-binding motif of Na(v)1.2 that determines channel concentration at the AIS depends on a glutamate residue (E1111), but also on several serine residues (S1112, S1124, and S1126). We showed that phosphorylation of these residues by protein kinase CK2 (CK2) regulates Na(v) channel interaction with ankyrins. Furthermore, we observed that CK2 is highly enriched at the AIS and the nodes of Ranvier in vivo. An ion channel chimera containing the Na(v)1.2 ankyrin-binding motif perturbed endogenous sodium channel accumulation at the AIS, whereas phosphorylation-deficient chimeras did not. Finally, inhibition of CK2 activity reduced sodium channel accumulation at the AIS of neurons. In conclusion, CK2 contributes to sodium channel organization by regulating their interaction with ankyrin G.
1 Ovarian carcinoma subtypes are different diseases: implications for biomarker studies. Although it has long been appreciated that ovarian carcinoma subtypes (serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous) are associated with different natural histories, most ovarian carcinoma biomarker studies and current treatment protocols for women with this disease are not subtype specific. With the emergence of high-throughput molecular techniques, distinct pathogenetic pathways have been identified in these subtypes. We examined variation in biomarker expression rates between subtypes, and how this influences correlations between biomarker expression and stage at diagnosis or prognosis. In this retrospective study we assessed the protein expression of 21 candidate tissue-based biomarkers (CA125, CRABP-II, EpCam, ER, F-Spondin, HE4, IGF2, K-Cadherin, Ki-67, KISS1, Matriptase, Mesothelin, MIF, MMP7, p21, p53, PAX8, PR, SLPI, TROP2, WT1) in a population-based cohort of 500 ovarian carcinomas that was collected over the period from 1984 to 2000. The expression of 20 of the 21 biomarkers differs significantly between subtypes, but does not vary across stage within each subtype. Survival analyses show that nine of the 21 biomarkers are prognostic indicators in the entire cohort but when analyzed by subtype only three remain prognostic indicators in the high-grade serous and none in the clear cell subtype. For example, tumor proliferation, as assessed by Ki-67 staining, varies markedly between different subtypes and is an unfavourable prognostic marker in the entire cohort (risk ratio [RR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2%-2.4%) but is not of prognostic significance within any subtype. Prognostic associations can even show an inverse correlation within the entire cohort, when compared to a specific subtype. For example, WT1 is more frequently expressed in high-grade serous carcinomas, an aggressive subtype, and is an unfavourable prognostic marker within the entire cohort of ovarian carcinomas (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2%-2.3%), but is a favourable prognostic marker within the high-grade serous subtype (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3%-0.8%). The association of biomarker expression with survival varies substantially between subtypes, and can easily be overlooked in whole cohort analyses. To avoid this effect, each subtype within a cohort should be analyzed discretely. Ovarian carcinoma subtypes are different diseases, and these differences should be reflected in clinical research study design and ultimately in the management of ovarian carcinoma.
3 Studies on cholesterol ester formation and hydrolysis in liver disease: a selective review. Plasma cholesterol esters are formed within the circulation by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), an enzyme produced by the liver. Patients with hepatocellular disease have low plasma LCAT activity. This largely accounts for the decreased levels of cholesterol esters observed in such patients and appears due to impaired hepatic production of the enzyme. In contrast, activity of the LCAT reaction in patients with cholestasis seems variable and is the subject of controversy, largely because the influence of abnormal cholestatic lipoproteins on the reaction requires further clarification.Human liver contains a lysosomal cholesterol ester hydrolase (CEH) which may play an important role in hepatic cholesterol homeostasis. In patients with liver damage there is no concrete evidence of circulating CEH activity, but recent studies show elevated activity of hydrolase within the liver itself in acute hepatitis. Hepatic activity of another lysosomal enzyme, acid phosphatase, is not increased, suggesting that high CEH in hepatitic liver does not simply reflect a general increase in lysosomal enzymes. The pathogenesis and significance of altered CEH activity in liver disease require further study.
1 Associations of serum concentrations of persistent organic pollutants with the prevalence of periodontal disease and subpopulations of white blood cells. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which are endocrine disruptors that accumulate in adipose tissue, can increase the risk of periodontal disease through the disturbance of the immune system. We examined associations of background exposure to POPs with periodontal disease in the general population. Cross-sectional associations of concentrations of serum POPs with the prevalence of periodontal disease were investigated in 1,234 adults > or = 20 years of age in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002. Among several POPs, organochlorine (OC) pesticides were most strongly associated with periodontal disease. Adjusted odds ratios across quintiles of OC pesticides were 1.0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.4, and 2.7 (p for trend < 0.01) for the presence in any site of clinical attachment loss > or = 4 mm and 1.0, 1.7, 2.6, 3.4, and 3.7 (p for trend < 0.01) for the presence of pocket depth > or = 4 mm. Polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins also showed significant positive associations with one or both definitions of periodontal disease. Results did not materially change when continuous variables of clinical attachment loss or pocket depth were used as outcomes. Although participants with periodontal disease had higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts, neutrophil counts were inversely related to OC pesticides (p for trend < 0.01). These inverse associations did not change after excluding subjects with C-reactive protein >/= 3 mg/L. POPs, especially OC pesticides, were positively associated with periodontal disease, possibly through immunomodulation due to OC pesticides.
0 Differential gene repertoire in Mycobacterium ulcerans identifies candidate genes for patho-adaptation. Based on large genomic sequence polymorphisms, several haplotypes belonging to two major lineages of the human pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans could be distinguished among patient isolates from various geographic origins. However, the biological relevance of insertional/deletional diversity is not understood. Using comparative genomics, we have investigated the genes located in regions of difference recently identified by DNA microarray based hybridisation analysis. The analysed regions of difference comprise approximately 7% of the entire M. ulcerans genome. Several different mechanisms leading to loss of functional genes were identified, ranging from pseudogenization, caused by frame shift mutations or mobile genetic element interspersing, to large sequence polymorphisms. Four hot spot regions for genetic instability were unveiled. Altogether, 229 coding sequences were found to be differentially inactivated, constituting a repertoire of coding sequence variation in the rather monomorphic M. ulcerans. The differential gene inactivation patterns associated with the M. ulcerans haplotypes identified candidate genes that may confer enhanced adaptation upon ablation of expression. A number of gene conversions confined to the classical lineage may contribute to particular virulence of this group comprising isolates from Africa and Australia. Identification of this spectrum of anti-virulence gene candidates expands our understanding of the pathogenicity and ecology of the emerging infectious disease Buruli ulcer.
1 Timeliness of enteric disease surveillance in 6 US states. We reviewed timeline information for a sample of Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli O157:H7 cases and all confirmed foodborne outbreaks reported in 6 states during 2002. Increasing the timeliness of case follow-up, molecular subtyping, and linkage of results are critical to reducing delays in the investigation of foodborne outbreaks.
0 Experimental evidence for splicing of intron-containing transcripts of plant LTR retrotransposon Ogre. Ogre elements are a distinct group of plant Ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposons characterized by several specific features, one of which is a separation of the gag-pol region into two non-overlapping open reading frames: ORF2 coding for Gag-Pro, and ORF3 coding for RT/RH-INT proteins. Previous characterization of Ogre elements from several plant species revealed that part of their transcripts lacks the region between ORF2 and ORF3, carrying one uninterrupted ORF instead. In this work, we investigated a hypothesis that this region represents an intron that is spliced out from part of the Ogre transcripts as a means for preferential production of ORF2-encoded proteins over those encoded by the complete ORF2-ORF3 region. The experiments involved analysis of transcription patterns of well-defined Ogre populations in a model plant Medicago truncatula and examination of transcripts carrying dissected pea Ogre intron expressed within a coding sequence of chimeric reporter gene. Both experimental approaches proved that the region between ORF2 and ORF3 is spliced from Ogre transcripts and showed that this process is only partial, probably due to weak splice signals. This is one of very few known cases of spliced LTR retrotransposons and the only one where splicing does not involve parts of the element's coding sequences, thus resembling intron splicing found in most cellular genes.
2 Minimal access surgery compared with medical management for chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: UK collaborative randomised trial. To determine the relative benefits and risks of laparoscopic fundoplication surgery as an alternative to long term drug treatment for chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Multicentre, pragmatic randomised trial (with parallel preference groups). 21 hospitals in the United Kingdom. 357 randomised participants (178 surgical, 179 medical) and 453 preference participants (261, 192); mean age 46; 66% men. All participants had documented evidence of GORD and symptoms for >12 months. The type of laparoscopic fundoplication used was left to the discretion of the surgeon. Those allocated to medical treatment had their treatment reviewed and adjusted as necessary by a local gastroenterologist, and subsequent clinical management was at the discretion of the clinician responsible for care. The disease specific REFLUX quality of life score (primary outcome), SF-36, EQ-5D, and medication use, measured at time points equivalent to three and 12 months after surgery, and surgical complications. Randomised participants had received drugs for GORD for median of 32 months before trial entry. Baseline REFLUX scores were 63.6 (SD 24.1) and 66.8 (SD 24.5) in the surgical and medical randomised groups, respectively. Of those randomised to surgery, 111 (62%) actually had total or partial fundoplication. Surgical complications were uncommon with a conversion rate of 0.6% and no mortality. By 12 months, 38% (59/154) randomised to surgery (14% (14/104) among those who had fundoplication) were taking reflux medication versus 90% (147/164) randomised medical management. The REFLUX score favoured the randomised surgical group (14.0, 95% confidence interval 9.6 to 18.4; P<0.001). Differences of a third to half of 1 SD in other health status measures also favoured the randomised surgical group. Baseline scores in the preference for surgery group were the worst; by 12 months these were better than in the preference for medical treatment group. At least up to 12 months after surgery, laparoscopic fundoplication significantly increased measures of health status in patients with GORD. ISRCTN15517081.
0 An early look at the therapeutic uses of some new vasopressin analogs in gastroenterology. Natural vasopressins have been used, with varying success, in attempts to stop bleeding from esophageal varices for over two decades. Reasons for lack of success include (a) failure to induce a sufficiently prolonged and constant vasoconstrictor effect at the bleeding site, (b) dangerous side-effects, and (c) release of plasminogen activator induced by the peptides which can lyse any clot as it forms.IN THE LAST DECADE ANALOGS OF VASOPRESSIN HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED WITH A PROLONGED ACTION, USING TWO SEPARATE PRINCIPLES OF CHEMICAL MODIFICATION: (1) hormonogens, and (2) blockage of sites of inactivating enzymatic cleavage (in particular "carba" analogs without a disulfide bridge). These two categories of analog are compared here: the carba analogs have the advantages of high potency (higher than the parent hormone) with prolongation, but are also very active on the plasminogen activator release system. The hormonogens combine prolongation with low potency, but have lost not only a releasing action on plasminogen activator, but also, by virtue of altered release kinetics, have effectively lost cardiovascular toxicity.Mechanisms of analog action and receptor interaction are presented, along with initial clinical experiences.
3 Spatial and temporal evolution of bluetongue virus in wild ruminants, Spain. We confirmed the emergence of bluetongue virus (BTV) in 5 wild ruminant species in Spain. BTV seroprevalence was high and dispersed with time, with a south-to-north gradient. Our results suggest a complex epidemiology of BTV and underline the need for additional research on wildlife in Europe.
1 The tree of genomes: an empirical comparison of genome-phylogeny reconstruction methods. In the past decade or more, the emphasis for reconstructing species phylogenies has moved from the analysis of a single gene to the analysis of multiple genes and even completed genomes. The simplest method of scaling up is to use familiar analysis methods on a larger scale and this is the most popular approach. However, duplications and losses of genes along with horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can lead to a situation where there is only an indirect relationship between gene and genome phylogenies. In this study we examine five widely-used approaches and their variants to see if indeed they are more-or-less saying the same thing. In particular, we focus on Conditioned Reconstruction as it is a method that is designed to work well even if HGT is present. We confirm a previous suggestion that this method has a systematic bias. We show that no two methods produce the same results and most current methods of inferring genome phylogenies produce results that are significantly different to other methods. We conclude that genome phylogenies need to be interpreted differently, depending on the method used to construct them.
1 Quantitative EEG findings in patients with acute, brief depression combined with other fluctuating psychiatric symptoms: a controlled study from an acute psychiatric department. Patients with brief depressive episodes and concurrent rapidly fluctuating psychiatric symptoms do not fit current diagnostic criteria and they can be difficult to diagnose and treat in an acute psychiatric setting. We wanted to study whether these patients had signs of more epileptic or organic brain dysfunction than patients with depression without additional symptomatology. Sixteen acutely admitted patients diagnosed with a brief depressive episode as well as another concurrent psychiatric diagnosis were included. Sixteen patients with major depression served as controls. Three electroencephalographic studies (EEG) were visually interpreted and the background activity was also analysed with quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). The group with brief depression and concurrent symptoms had multiple abnormal features in their standard EEG compared to patients with major depression, but they did not show significantly more epileptiform activity. They also had significantly higher temporal QEEG delta amplitude and interhemispheric temporal delta asymmetry. Organic brain dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of patients with brief depressive episodes mixed with rapidly fluctuating psychiatric symptoms. This subgroup of depressed patients should be investigated further in order to clarify the pathophysiology and to establish the optimal evaluation scheme and treatment in an acute psychiatric setting.
3 Sir William Osler revisited. The basis of Sir William Osler's fame is elusive to almost all and the appropriateness of such recognition is questioned by many. His many contributions as a practitioner, teacher, writer, and scientist in medicine do not adequately explain his prominence 60 years following his death. It was his participation in the covenant of medicine and the special components of that relationship that may account for his hold on his followers today.
3 Interleukin-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha impede neutral lipid turnover in macrophage-derived foam cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can affect intracellular lipid metabolism. A variety of effects have been described for different cell types; hepatocyte lipid turnover pathways are inhibited during inflammation, whereas interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) reduces intracellular cholesterol levels in fibroblasts. Levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are up-regulated at sites of formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Plaque formation is though to begin with infiltration of monocytes to the intimal layer of the vascular wall, followed by differentiation to macrophages and macrophage uptake of modified lipoproteins, resulting in accumulation of intracellular lipids. The lipid-filled cells are referred to as macrophage foam cells, a key feature of atherosclerotic plaques. We have investigated the effects of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha on macrophage foam cells in order to assess whether presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokines improves or aggravates macrophage foam cell formation by affecting lipid accumulation and lipid turn-over in the cells. Differentiated primary human macrophages or THP-1 cells were lipid loaded by uptake of aggregated low density lipoproteins (AgLDL) or very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and then incubated with IL-1beta (0 - 5000 pg/ml) in lipoprotein-free media for 24 h. Cells incubated in absence of cytokine utilized accumulated neutral lipids, in particular triglycerides. Addition of exogenous IL-1beta resulted in a dose-dependent retention of intracellular cholesterol and triglycerides. Exchanging IL-1beta with TNF-alpha gave a similar response. Analysis of fatty acid efflux and intracellular fatty acid activation revealed a pattern of decreased lipid utilization in cytokine-stimulated cells. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha enhance macrophage foam cell formation, in part by inhibition of macrophage intracellular lipid catabolism. If present in vivo, these mechanisms will further augment the pro-atherogenic properties of the two cytokines.
2 Recent advances in the understanding of acupuncture. The controversy about acupuncture is familiar to us since its recent reintroduction into this country. Much of its philosophical concepts were taken at their face values as the bases for condemnation. Since I last reviewed these antiquated concepts in the light of modern medicine, much has developed. It seems that if the effects of acupuncture were transmitted along the peripheral nerves to the central nervous system, it would be more effective if applied segmentally to the site of noxious stimulation. Disruption of extralamniscal pathways would abolish its analgesic effect. The distant and nonsegmentally located acupuncture points exert their influences through the integrative efforts of the reticular formation and the thalamus. The demonstration of transmissibility of acupuncture analgesia through blood and cerebrospinal fluid in animals implicates the involvement of humoral factors. Since such an effect can be suppressed by naloxone or by hypophysectomy, endorphins are thought to be involved. Such laboratory evidences indeed begin to shed some light on a possible neurohumoral mechanism of acupuncture. The differences between acupuncture and hypnosis are discussed. Acupuncture points were compared with referred pain, trigger points and motor points of the skeletal muscles. Its possible uses for other than pain, such as drug addiction, alcoholism, etc. are also reviewed.
1 Guidelines to evaluate human observational studies for quantitative risk assessment. Careful evaluation of the quality of human observational studies (HOS) is required to assess the suitability of HOS for quantitative risk assessment (QRA). In particular, the quality of quantitative exposure assessment is a crucial aspect of HOS to be considered for QRA. We aimed to develop guidelines for the evaluation of HOS for QRA and to apply these guidelines to case-control and cohort studies on the relation between exposure to benzene and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We developed a three-tiered framework specific for the evaluation of HOS for QRA and used it to evaluate HOS on the relation between exposure to benzene and AML. The developed framework consists of 20 evaluation criteria. A specific focus of the framework was on the quality of exposure assessment applied in HOS. Seven HOS on the relation of benzene and AML were eligible for evaluation. Of these studies, five were suitable for QRA and were ranked based on the quality of the study design, conduct, and reporting on the study. The developed guidelines facilitate a structured evaluation that is transparent in its application and harmonizes the evaluation of HOS for QRA. With the application of the guidelines, it was possible to identify studies suitable for QRA of benzene and AML and rank these studies based on their quality. Application of the guidelines in QRA will be a valuable addition to the assessment of the weight of evidence of HOS for QRA.
3 The incidence of carcinoma in solitary "cold" thyroid nodules. Two hundred and three patients with single thyroid nodules were referred for radioactive scan of the thyroid. Solitary "cold" nodules were identified in 130 patients and 68 of these patients came to surgery. Of this group, 12 patients were found to have carcinoma. There was no obvious selection process which distinguished the 68 patients who underwent surgery from the 62 who did not. There is a significant risk of thyroid neoplasms occurring in patients with solitary "cold" nodules, and this is particularly true in patients under forty.
0 The use of D-penicillamine in cystinuria: efficacy and untoward reactions. A retrospective study was conducted to assess the efficacy of D-penicillamine in the management of cystinuria, as well as to define the frequency and nature of untoward reactions to this drug. Fifty-six individuals were identified who, by stone analysis and/or biochemical studies, met the accepted diagnostic criteria for phenotypic cystinuria. The majority of these patients presented in the second decade of life with evidence of stone formation: renal colic, hematuria, and/or stone passage. Thirty-five individuals were considered to have clinically advanced cystinuria because they had required at least one urinary tract lithotomy. In these advanced cases, frequency of subsequent lithotomies and episodes of renal colic per 100 patient-years of observation were used as indices to measure the efficacy of D-penicillamine treatment. By both measurements, D-penicillamine significantly improved the clinical course of patients. The incidence of acute drug sensitivity reactions (rash, fever, and/or arthropathy) was in excess of 40 percent. Delayed drug-induced proteinuria occurred in 34 percent of treated patients. We conclude that D-penicillamine is useful in the treatment of cystinuria. Because of the significant number of untoward drug reactions, however, we believe the drug should be instituted only in selected, high-risk patients.
1 Tissues from routine pathology archives are suitable for microRNA analyses by quantitative PCR. MicroRNAs have recently taken centre stage as short non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNA expression. To assess the feasibility of using microRNA techniques on routinely processed tissues, the accessibility of two representative microRNAs was examined by real-time quantitative PCR in 86 human formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from liver, breast, bone marrow, lymphatic tissues and colon. Murine liver was used to analyse the influence of fixation time and different fixatives. High-quality microRNA was successfully extracted from routinely processed formalin-fixed tissues, resembling PCR amplification results from snap-frozen material analysed in parallel. While fixation time did not affect microRNA accessibility, non-buffered formalin or fixative supplements such as glutaraldehyde influenced PCR results. Storage of human tissues for up to 7 years did not cause a significant deterioration of microRNA. However, microRNA quality in human archival material following routine processing 10-20 years ago was decreased. Oxidation by ambient air during storage and fixation in non-buffered formalin is a possible reason for loss of microRNA quality. The assessment of microRNAs in readily obtained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples is a highly promising tool in molecular pathology when similarly treated samples are analysed. Therefore, microRNA analyses will gain wider acceptance as an adjunct to morphological tissue assessment in routine pathology and retrospective studies.
0 Genetic variation in PNPLA3 confers susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a burgeoning health problem of unknown etiology that varies in prevalence among ancestry groups. To identify genetic variants contributing to differences in hepatic fat content, we carried out a genome-wide association scan of nonsynonymous sequence variations (n = 9,229) in a population comprising Hispanic, African American and European American individuals. An allele in PNPLA3 (rs738409[G], encoding I148M) was strongly associated with increased hepatic fat levels (P = 5.9 x 10(-10)) and with hepatic inflammation (P = 3.7 x 10(-4)). The allele was most common in Hispanics, the group most susceptible to NAFLD; hepatic fat content was more than twofold higher in PNPLA3 rs738409[G] homozygotes than in noncarriers. Resequencing revealed another allele of PNPLA3 (rs6006460[T], encoding S453I) that was associated with lower hepatic fat content in African Americans, the group at lowest risk of NAFLD. Thus, variation in PNPLA3 contributes to ancestry-related and inter-individual differences in hepatic fat content and susceptibility to NAFLD.
3 Effect of carnosine, aminoguanidine, and aspirin drops on the prevention of cataracts in diabetic rats. To investigate the effect of carnosine (CA), aminoguanidine (AG), and aspirin (ASA) drops, all inhibitors of glycation, on the development of diabetic cataract in rat. Rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin, and based on the level of plasma glucose, they were assigned as non-diabetic rats (<14 mmol/l plasma glucose) and diabetic rats (>14 mmol/l plasma glucose). Animals in the treated groups received CA, AG, and ASA as drops to the left eyes starting from the day of streptozotocin injection. Progression of lens opacification was recorded using the slit lamp at regular time intervals. All the rats were killed after the week 13, and the levels of advanced glycation end products (AGE), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) were determined. Lens opacification progressed in a biphasic manner in the diabetic rats, an initial slow increase during the first eight weeks of diabetes followed by a steep increase in the next five weeks. Carnosine treatment delayed the progression of cataracts in diabetic rats, and the delay was statistically significant on the fourth week of diabetes (p<0.05, when compared with untreated moderately diabetic rats). A decrease in the antioxidant enzymes of CAT and the level of GSH was found in the lens of the untreated diabetic rats at 13 weeks after injection. Some protection was provided in the treated eyes. The level of glycation in the untreated diabetic rats was significantly higher than that in the normal rats (p<0.001). After treatment with CA, AG, and ASA, those diabetic rats had a lower level of glycated lens protein compared to the untreated diabetic rats (p<0.001). These results thus suggest that the effect of CA, AG, and ASA is indeed inhibition of the formation of AGEs. However, the effect of CA, AG, and ASA is overwhelmed by the excessive accumulation of AGEs in the severely diabetic rats. CA compared with AG and ASA treatment can delay the progression of lens opacification in the diabetic rats only during the earlier stages. It also protects against the inactivation of enzymes.
0 A systematic survey of mini-proteins in bacteria and archaea. Mini-proteins, defined as polypeptides containing no more than 100 amino acids, are ubiquitous in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. They play significant roles in various biological processes, and their regulatory functions gradually attract the attentions of scientists. However, the functions of the majority of mini-proteins are still largely unknown due to the constraints of experimental methods and bioinformatic analysis. In this article, we extracted a total of 180,879 mini-proteins from the annotations of 532 sequenced genomes, including 491 strains of Bacteria and 41 strains of Archaea. The average proportion of mini-proteins among all genomic proteins is approximately 10.99%, but different strains exhibit remarkable fluctuations. These mini-proteins display two notable characteristics. First, the majority are species-specific proteins with an average proportion of 58.79% among six representative phyla. Second, an even larger proportion (70.03% among all strains) is hypothetical proteins. However, a fraction of highly conserved hypothetical proteins potentially play crucial roles in organisms. Among mini-proteins with known functions, it seems that regulatory and metabolic proteins are more abundant than essential structural proteins. Furthermore, domains in mini-proteins seem to have greater distributions in Bacteria than Eukarya. Analysis of the evolutionary progression of these domains reveals that they have diverged to new patterns from a single ancestor. Mini-proteins are ubiquitous in bacterial and archaeal species and play significant roles in various functions. The number of mini-proteins in each genome displays remarkable fluctuation, likely resulting from the differential selective pressures that reflect the respective life-styles of the organisms. The answers to many questions surrounding mini-proteins remain elusive and need to be resolved experimentally.
1 Pulmonary dysfunction in ultramarathon runners. To assess the effects of extreme exercise on lung function we measured maximal expiratory flow volume (MEFV) curves in fifteen runners (mean age, 35.3 years; range, 26-46) before and after an 80.6 to 100 km (50-62.2 mile) road race. Mean running time for 80.6 km was 7 hr, 42 min. Post-race testing showed significant decreases of 12.4 percent in forced vital capacity (FVC), 9.5 percent in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 13.7 percent in peak expiratory flow (PF), and 28.4 percent in flow at 50 percent of FVC (MEF50). By 2.5 hours after the race lung function had improved. The reduction in flow rates after ultramarathon running may be due to airway obstruction. In contrast, the decrease in FVC with gradual recovery of lung function after rest and nourishment suggests the development of respiratory muscle fatigue.
2 The influence of age on the response to renal parenchymal loss. The effect of age on compensatory hypertrophy and functional adaptation to loss of 75 percent of renal mass was studied in canine puppies. In one group of animals the surgery was done between 1-5 days after birth and in another group, at two months of age. All animals were studied six weeks later. Shamoperated littermates served as controls. The newborn puppies in the experimental group were able to grow and maintain homeostasis as well as their controls, whereas the older experimental animals grew poorly and had significantly higher levels of plasma creatinine than their sham-operated counterparts (p < .05). The increase in mass of the remaining kidney was twice as much in the newborn as in the older dogs. Functional adaptation, as expressed by GFR, was nearly complete in the young, but reached only about 45 percent of controls in the older age group (p<.005). The intrarenal blood flow distribution was similar for experimental and control animals in both groups studied. There were, however, marked differences in the pattern of single glomerular perfusion rates: whereas in the older dogs the increase was confined to the deeper nephrons, in the newborn an increase occurred in all zones of the kidney. These studies demonstrate that compensation for massive loss of renal tissue is complete when the injury is sustained in the immediate postnatal period but only partial when it occurs later on in life. A loss in the adaptive capacity of the superficial nephrons appears to account for this age-related difference.
2 Pressure support ventilation attenuates ventilator-induced protein modifications in the diaphragm. Controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) induces profound modifications of diaphragm protein metabolism, including muscle atrophy and severe ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction. Diaphragmatic modifications could be decreased by spontaneous breathing. We hypothesized that mechanical ventilation in pressure support ventilation (PSV), which preserves diaphragm muscle activity, would limit diaphragmatic protein catabolism. Forty-two adult Sprague-Dawley rats were included in this prospective randomized animal study. After intraperitoneal anesthesia, animals were randomly assigned to the control group or to receive 6 or 18 hours of CMV or PSV. After sacrifice and incubation with 14C-phenylalanine, in vitro proteolysis and protein synthesis were measured on the costal region of the diaphragm. We also measured myofibrillar protein carbonyl levels and the activity of 20S proteasome and tripeptidylpeptidase II. Compared with control animals, diaphragmatic protein catabolism was significantly increased after 18 hours of CMV (33%, P = 0.0001) but not after 6 hours. CMV also decreased protein synthesis by 50% (P = 0.0012) after 6 hours and by 65% (P < 0.0001) after 18 hours of mechanical ventilation. Both 20S proteasome activity levels were increased by CMV. Compared with CMV, 6 and 18 hours of PSV showed no significant increase in proteolysis. PSV did not significantly increase protein synthesis versus controls. Both CMV and PSV increased protein carbonyl levels after 18 hours of mechanical ventilation from +63% (P < 0.001) and +82% (P < 0.0005), respectively. PSV is efficient at reducing mechanical ventilation-induced proteolysis and inhibition of protein synthesis without modifications in the level of oxidative injury compared with continuous mechanical ventilation. PSV could be an interesting alternative to limit ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction.
3 Systemic resistance and lipoxygenase-related defence response induced in tomato by Pseudomonas putida strain BTP1. Previous studies showed the ability of Pseudomonas putida strain BTP1 to promote induced systemic resistance (ISR) in different host plants. Since ISR is long-lasting and not conducive for development of resistance of the targeted pathogen, this phenomenon can take part of disease control strategies. However, in spite of the numerous examples of ISR induced by PGPR in plants, only a few biochemical studies have associated the protective effect with specific host metabolic changes. In this study, we showed the protective effect of this bacterium in tomato against Botrytis cinerea. Following treatment by P. putida BTP1, analyses of acid-hydrolyzed leaf extracts showed an accumulation of antifungal material after pathogen infection. The fungitoxic compounds thus mainly accumulate as conjugates from which active aglycones may be liberated through the activity of hydrolytic enzymes. These results suggest that strain BTP1 can elicit systemic phytoalexin accumulation in tomato as one defence mechanism. On another hand, we have shown that key enzymes of the lipoxygenase pathway are stimulated in plants treated with the bacteria as compared with control plants. Interestingly, this stimulation is observed only after pathogen challenge in agreement with the priming concept almost invariably associated with the ISR phenomenon. Through the demonstration of phytoalexin accumulation and LOX pathway stimulation in tomato, this work provides new insights into the diversity of defence mechanisms that are inducible by non-pathogenic bacteria in the context of ISR.
3 In vitro susceptibility of selected bacteria to cefaclor. Cefaclor is an orally absorbed cephalosporin antibiotic chemically and pharmacologically similar to cephalexin. It appears to be more active than cephalexin against susceptible strains. The in vitro sensitivity of 230 clinical bacterial isolates to cefaclor was studied. Most isolates of S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and indole negative Proteus species were inhibited at clinically attainable serum and urine concentrations. Like cephalexin, cefaclor was less active against isolates of Enterobacter species, indole positive Proteus species and enterococci although many of these isolates were inhibited at concentrations achievable in urine.
0 Exon creation and establishment in human genes. A large proportion of species-specific exons are alternatively spliced. In primates, Alu elements play a crucial role in the process of exon creation but many new exons have appeared through other mechanisms. Despite many recent studies, it is still unclear which are the splicing regulatory requirements for de novo exonization and how splicing regulation changes throughout an exon's lifespan. Using comparative genomics, we have defined sets of exons with different evolutionary ages. Younger exons have weaker splice-sites and lower absolute values for the relative abundance of putative splicing regulators between exonic and adjacent intronic regions, indicating a less consolidated splicing regulation. This relative abundance is shown to increase with exon age, leading to higher exon inclusion. We show that this local difference in the density of regulators might be of biological significance, as it outperforms other measures in real exon versus pseudo-exon classification. We apply this new measure to the specific case of the exonization of anti-sense Alu elements and show that they are characterized by a general lack of exonic splicing silencers. Our results suggest that specific sequence environments are required for exonization and that these can change with time. We propose a model of exon creation and establishment in human genes, in which splicing decisions depend on the relative local abundance of regulatory motifs. Using this model, we provide further explanation as to why Alu elements serve as a major substrate for exon creation in primates. Finally, we discuss the benefits of integrating such information in gene prediction.
3 Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 malaria vaccine adjuvanted with Alhydrogel, Montanide ISA 720 or AS02. Plasmodium falciparum Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (PfAMA1) is a candidate vaccine antigen expressed by merozoites and sporozoites. It plays a key role in red blood cell and hepatocyte invasion that can be blocked by antibodies. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of recombinant PfAMA1 in a dose-escalating, phase Ia trial. PfAMA1 FVO strain, produced in Pichia pastoris, was reconstituted at 10 microg and 50 microg doses with three different adjuvants, Alhydrogel, Montanide ISA720 and AS02 Adjuvant System. Six randomised groups of healthy male volunteers, 8-10 volunteers each, were scheduled to receive three immunisations at 4-week intervals. Safety and immunogenicity data were collected over one year. Transient pain was the predominant injection site reaction (80-100%). Induration occurred in the Montanide 50 microg group, resulting in a sterile abscess in two volunteers. Systemic adverse events occurred mainly in the AS02 groups lasting for 1-2 days. Erythema was observed in 22% of Montanide and 59% of AS02 group volunteers. After the second dose, six volunteers in the AS02 group and one in the Montanide group who reported grade 3 erythema (>50 mm) were withdrawn as they met the stopping criteria. All adverse events resolved. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Humoral responses were highest in the AS02 groups. Antibodies showed activity in an in vitro growth inhibition assay up to 80%. Upon stimulation with the vaccine, peripheral mononuclear cells from all groups proliferated and secreted IFNgamma and IL-5 cytokines. All formulations showed distinct reactogenicity profiles. All formulations with PfAMA1 were immunogenic and induced functional antibodies. (Clinicaltrials.gov) NCT00730782.
0 Gamma-tocotrienol suppresses prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion through multiple-signalling pathways. Tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) has demonstrated antiproliferative effect on prostate cancer (PCa) cells. To elucidate this anticancer property in PCa cells, this study aimed, first, to identify the most potent isomer for eliminating PCa cells; and second, to decipher the molecular pathway responsible for its activity. Results showed that the inhibitory effect of gamma-tocotrienol was most potent, which resulted in induction of apoptosis as evidenced by activation of pro-caspases and the presence of sub-G(1) cell population. Examination of the pro-survival genes revealed that the gamma-tocotrienol-induced cell death was associated with suppression of NF-kappaB, EGF-R and Id family proteins (Id1 and Id3). Meanwhile, gamma-tocotrienol treatment also resulted in the induction of JNK-signalling pathway and inhibition of JNK activity by a specific inhibitor (SP600125) was able to partially block the effect of gamma-tocotrienol. Interestingly, gamma-tocotrienol treatment led to suppression of mesenchymal markers and the restoration of E-cadherin and gamma-catenin expression, which was associated with suppression of cell invasion capability. Furthermore, a synergistic effect was observed when cells were co-treated with gamma-tocotrienol and Docetaxel. Our results suggested that the antiproliferative effect of gamma-tocotrienol act through multiple-signalling pathways, and demonstrated for the first time the anti-invasion and chemosensitisation effect of gamma-tocotrienol against PCa cells.
0 Evolutionary rate and gene expression across different brain regions. The evolutionary rate of a protein is a basic measure of evolution at the molecular level. Previous studies have shown that genes expressed in the brain have significantly lower evolutionary rates than those expressed in somatic tissues. We study the evolutionary rates of genes expressed in 21 different human brain regions. We find that genes highly expressed in the more recent cortical regions of the brain have lower evolutionary rates than genes highly expressed in subcortical regions. This may partially result from the observation that genes that are highly expressed in cortical regions tend to be highly expressed in subcortical regions, and thus their evolution faces a richer set of functional constraints. The frequency of mammal-specific and primate-specific genes is higher in the highly expressed gene sets of subcortical brain regions than in those of cortical brain regions. The basic inverse correlation between evolutionary rate and gene expression is significantly stronger in brain versus nonbrain tissues, and in cortical versus subcortical regions. Extending upon this cortical/subcortical trend, this inverse correlation is generally more marked for tissues that are located higher along the cranial vertical axis during development, giving rise to the possibility that these tissues are also more evolutionarily recent. We find that cortically expressed genes are more conserved than subcortical ones, and that gene expression levels exert stronger constraints on sequence evolution in cortical versus subcortical regions. Taken together, these findings suggest that cortically expressed genes are under stronger selective pressure than subcortically expressed genes.
3 Swine trichinella infection and geographic information system tools. Pastured pigs are vulnerable to Trichinella spiralis infection through exposure to wild reservoir hosts. To evaluate the potential impact of the expanding production of pork from pasture-raised pigs, we mapped locations of T. spiralis occurrence and pastured-pig farms in the United States. Twenty-eight farms were located within 50 km of previous infection.
1 MAL promoter hypermethylation as a novel prognostic marker in gastric cancer. T-lymphocyte maturation associated protein, MAL, has been described as a tumour-suppressor gene with diagnostic value in colorectal and oesophageal cancers, and can be inactivated by promoter hypermethylation. The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of MAL promoter hypermethylation and the association with mRNA expression in gastric cancers and to correlate methylation status to clinicopathological data. Bisulphite-treated DNA isolated from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples of 202 gastric adenocarcinomas and 22 normal gastric mucosae was subjected to real-time methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP). Two regions within the MAL promoter (M1 and M2) were analysed. In addition, 17 frozen gastric carcinomas and two gastric cancer cell lines were analysed both by Q-MSP and real-time RT-PCR. Methylation of M1 and M2 occurred in 71 and 80% of the gastric cancers, respectively, but not in normal gastric mucosa tissue. Hypermethylation of M2, but not M1, correlated with significantly better disease-free survival in a univariate (P=0.03) and multivariate analysis (P=0.03) and with downregulation of expression (P=0.01). These results indicate that MAL has a putative tumour-suppressor gene function in gastric cancer, and detection of promoter hypermethylation may be useful as a prognostic marker.
1 CrossHybDetector: detection of cross-hybridization events in DNA microarray experiments. DNA microarrays contain thousands of different probe sequences represented on their surface. These are designed in such a way that potential cross-hybridization reactions with non-target sequences are minimized. However, given the large number of probes, the occurrence of cross hybridization events cannot be excluded. This problem can dramatically affect the data quality and cause false positive/false negative results. CrossHybDetector is a software package aimed at the identification of cross-hybridization events occurred during individual array hybridization, by using the probe sequences and the array intensity values. As output, the software provides the user with a list of array spots potentially 'corrupted' and their associated p-values calculated by Monte Carlo simulations. Graphical plots are also generated, which provide a visual and global overview of the quality of the microarray experiment with respect to cross-hybridization issues. CrossHybDetector is implemented as a package for the statistical computing environment R and is freely available under the LGPL license within the CRAN project.
3 Role of Cajal bodies and nucleolus in the maturation of the U1 snRNP in Arabidopsis. The biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs takes place in both the cytoplasm where Sm core proteins are added and snRNAs are modified at the 5' and 3' termini and in the nucleus where snRNP-specific proteins associate. U1 snRNP consists of U1 snRNA, seven Sm proteins and three snRNP-specific proteins, U1-70K, U1A, and U1C. It has been shown previously that after import to the nucleus U2 and U4/U6 snRNP-specific proteins first appear in Cajal bodies (CB) and then in splicing speckles. In addition, in cells grown under normal conditions U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs/snRNPs are abundant in CBs. Therefore, it has been proposed that the final assembly of these spliceosomal snRNPs takes place in this nuclear compartment. In contrast, U1 snRNA in both animal and plant cells has rarely been found in this nuclear compartment. Here, we analysed the subnuclear distribution of Arabidopsis U1 snRNP-specific proteins fused to GFP or mRFP in transiently transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts. Irrespective of the tag used, U1-70K was exclusively found in the nucleus, whereas U1A and U1C were equally distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the nucleus all three proteins localised to CBs and nucleoli although to different extent. Interestingly, we also found that the appearance of the three proteins in nuclear speckles differ significantly. U1-70K was mostly found in speckles whereas U1A and U1C in approximately 90% of cells showed diffuse nucleoplasmic in combination with CBs and nucleolar localisation. Our data indicate that CBs and nucleolus are involved in the maturation of U1 snRNP. Differences in nuclear accumulation and distribution between U1-70K and U1A and U1C proteins may indicate that either U1-70K or U1A and U1C associate with, or is/are involved, in other nuclear processes apart from pre-mRNA splicing.
3 Phosphorylation by Cdk1 increases the binding of Eg5 to microtubules in vitro and in Xenopus egg extract spindles. Motor proteins from the kinesin-5 subfamily play an essential role in spindle assembly during cell division of most organisms. These motors crosslink and slide microtubules in the spindle. Kinesin-5 motors are phosphorylated at a conserved site by Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) during mitosis. Xenopus laevis kinesin-5 has also been reported to be phosphorylated by Aurora A in vitro. We investigate here the effect of these phosphorylations on kinesin-5 from Xenopus laevis, called Eg5. We find that phosphorylation at threonine 937 in the C-terminal tail of Eg5 by Cdk1 does not affect the velocity of Eg5, but strongly increases its binding to microtubules assembled in buffer. Likewise, this phosphorylation promotes binding of Eg5 to microtubules in Xenopus egg extract spindles. This enhancement of binding elevates the amount of Eg5 in spindles above a critical level required for bipolar spindle formation. We find furthermore that phosphorylation of Xenopus laevis Eg5 by Aurora A at serine 543 in the stalk is not required for spindle formation. These results show that phosphorylation of Eg5 by Cdk1 has a direct effect on the interaction of this motor with microtubules. In egg extract, phosphorylation of Eg5 by Cdk1 ensures that the amount of Eg5 in the spindle is above a level that is required for spindle formation. This enhanced targeting to the spindle appears therefore to be, at least in part, a direct consequence of the enhanced binding of Eg5 to microtubules upon phosphorylation by Cdk1. These findings advance our understanding of the regulation of this essential mitotic motor protein.
2 Nosocomial Outbreaks Caused by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides. From July 2003 through October 2004, 42 patients became infected by strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (genotype 1) in different departments of Juan Canalejo Hospital in northwest Spain. During 2006, 6 inpatients, also in different departments of the hospital, became infected (genotypes 2-4). Parenteral nutrition was the likely source.
2 Managing potential laboratory exposure to ebola virus by using a patient biocontainment care unit. In 2004, a scientist from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) was potentially exposed to a mouse-adapted variant of the Zaire species of Ebola virus. The circumstances surrounding the case are presented, in addition to an update on historical admissions to the medical containment suite at USAMRIID. Research facilities contemplating work with pathogens requiring Biosafety Level 4 laboratory precautions should be mindful of the occupational health issues highlighted in this article.
0 Segmentation-based detection of allelic imbalance and loss-of-heterozygosity in cancer cells using whole genome SNP arrays. We present a strategy for detection of loss-of-heterozygosity and allelic imbalance in cancer cells from whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping data. Using a dilution series of a tumor cell line mixed with its paired normal cell line and data generated on Affymetrix and Illumina platforms, including paired tumor-normal samples and tumors characterized by fluorescent in situ hybridization, we demonstrate a high sensitivity and specificity of the strategy for detecting both minute and gross allelic imbalances in heterogeneous tumor samples.
3 Sandfly fever Sicilian virus, Algeria. To determine whether sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) is present in Algeria, we tested sandflies for phlebovirus RNA. A sequence closely related to that of SFSV was detected in a Phlebotomus ariasi sandfly. Of 60 human serum samples, 3 contained immunoglobulin G against SFSV. These data suggest SFSV is present in Algeria.
1 The estimation of low-dose hazards by extrapolation from high doses. Empirical information on the effects of low doses of ionizing radiation is beset by severe limitations. Theoretical considerations of biophysics can guide the analysis of epidemiological data by indicating certain dose-response relations or eliminating others. Thus, it can be shown that at low doses there must be proportionality between dose and effect on non-interacting cells and that one must anticipate different dose-effect relations upon exposure to markedly different types of radiation.
0 Assembly of the PtdIns 4-kinase Stt4 complex at the plasma membrane requires Ypp1 and Efr3. The phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) is an essential signaling lipid that regulates secretion and polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the PtdIns 4-kinase Stt4 catalyzes the synthesis of PtdIns4P at the plasma membrane (PM). In this paper, we identify and characterize two novel regulatory components of the Stt4 kinase complex, Ypp1 and Efr3. The essential gene YPP1 encodes a conserved protein that colocalizes with Stt4 at cortical punctate structures and regulates the stability of this lipid kinase. Accordingly, Ypp1 interacts with distinct regions on Stt4 that are necessary for the assembly and recruitment of multiple copies of the kinase into phosphoinositide kinase (PIK) patches. We identify the membrane protein Efr3 as an additional component of Stt4 PIK patches. Efr3 is essential for assembly of both Ypp1 and Stt4 at PIK patches. We conclude that Ypp1 and Efr3 are required for the formation and architecture of Stt4 PIK patches and ultimately PM-based PtdIns4P signaling.

2 Effects of inhaled iloprost on right ventricular contractility, right ventriculo-vascular coupling and ventricular interdependence: a randomized placebo-controlled trial in an experimental model of acute pulmonary hypertension. Prostacyclin inhalation is increasingly used to treat acute pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure, although its pharmacodynamic properties remain controversial. Prostacyclins not only affect vasomotor tone but may also have cAMP-mediated positive inotropic effects and modulate autonomic nervous system tone. We studied the role of these different mechanisms in the overall haemodynamic effects produced by iloprost inhalation in an experimental model of acute pulmonary hypertension. In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled animal study, twenty-six pigs (mean weight 35 +/- 2 kg) were instrumented with biventricular conductance catheters, a pulmonary artery flow probe and a high-fidelity pulmonary artery pressure catheter. The effects of inhaled iloprost (50 microg) were studied in the following groups: animals with acute hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, and healthy animals with and without blockade of the autonomic nervous system. During pulmonary hypertension, inhalation of iloprost resulted in a 51% increase in cardiac output compared with placebo (5.6 +/- 0.7 versus 3.7 +/- 0.8 l/minute; P = 0.0013), a selective reduction in right ventricular afterload (effective pulmonary arterial elastance: 0.6 +/- 0.3 versus 1.2 +/- 0.5 mmHg/ml; P = 0.0005) and a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (91 +/- 12 versus 70 +/- 20 ml; P = 0.006). Interestingly, right ventricular contractility was reduced after iloprost-treatment (slope of preload recruitable stroke work: 2.2 +/- 0.5 versus 3.4 +/- 0.8 mWatt.s/ml; P = 0.0002), whereas ventriculo-vascular coupling remained essentially preserved (ratio of right ventricular end-systolic elastance to effective pulmonary arterial elastance: 0.97 +/- 0.33 versus 1.03 +/- 0.15). In healthy animals, inhaled iloprost had only minimal haemodynamic effects and produced no direct effects on myocardial contractility, even after pharmacological blockade of the autonomic nervous system. In animals with acute pulmonary hypertension, inhaled iloprost improved global haemodynamics primarily via selective pulmonary vasodilatation and restoration of left ventricular preload. The reduction in right ventricular afterload is associated with a paradoxical decrease in right ventricular contractility. Our data suggest that this reflects an indirect mechanism by which ventriculo-vascular coupling is maintained at the lowest possible energetic cost. We found no evidence for a direct negative inotropic effect of iloprost.
3 SUMO-specific protease 2 is essential for modulating p53-Mdm2 in development of trophoblast stem cell niches and lineages. SUMO-specific protease 2 (SENP2) modifies proteins by removing SUMO from its substrates. Although SUMO-specific proteases are known to reverse sumoylation in many defined systems, their importance in mammalian development and pathogenesis remains largely elusive. Here we report that SENP2 is highly expressed in trophoblast cells that are required for placentation. Targeted disruption of SENP2 in mice reveals its essential role in development of all three trophoblast layers. The mutation causes a deficiency in cell cycle progression. SENP2 has a specific role in the G-S transition, which is required for mitotic and endoreduplication cell cycles in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, respectively. SENP2 ablation disturbs the p53-Mdm2 pathway, affecting the expansion of trophoblast progenitors and their maturation. Reintroducing SENP2 into the mutants can reduce the sumoylation of Mdm2, diminish the p53 level and promote trophoblast development. Furthermore, downregulation of p53 alleviates the SENP2-null phenotypes and stimulation of p53 causes abnormalities in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, resembling those of the SENP2 mutants. Our data reveal a key genetic pathway, SENP2-Mdm2-p53, underlying trophoblast lineage development, suggesting its pivotal role in cell cycle progression of mitosis and endoreduplication.
1 Exploring TAR-RNA aptamer loop-loop interaction by X-ray crystallography, UV spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance. In HIV-1, trans-activation of transcription of the viral genome is regulated by an imperfect hairpin, the trans-activating responsive (TAR) RNA element, located at the 5' untranslated end of all viral transcripts. TAR acts as a binding site for viral and cellular proteins. In an attempt to identify RNA ligands that would interfere with the virus life-cycle by interacting with TAR, an in vitro selection was previously carried out. RNA hairpins that formed kissing-loop dimers with TAR were selected [Ducongé F. and Toulmé JJ (1999) RNA, 5:1605-1614]. We describe here the crystal structure of TAR bound to a high-affinity RNA aptamer. The two hairpins form a kissing complex and interact through six Watson-Crick base pairs. The complex adopts an overall conformation with an inter-helix angle of 28.1 degrees , thus contrasting with previously reported solution and modelling studies. Structural analysis reveals that inter-backbone hydrogen bonds between ribose 2' hydroxyl and phosphate oxygens at the stem-loop junctions can be formed. Thermal denaturation and surface plasmon resonance experiments with chemically modified 2'-O-methyl incorporated into both hairpins at key positions, clearly demonstrate the involvement of this intermolecular network of hydrogen bonds in complex stability.
0 Functional characterization of alternatively spliced human SECISBP2 transcript variants. Synthesis of selenoproteins depends on decoding of the UGA stop codon as the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). This process requires the presence of a Sec insertion sequence element (SECIS) in the 3'-untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNAs and its interaction with the SECIS binding protein 2 (SBP2). In humans, mutations in the SBP2-encoding gene Sec insertion sequence binding protein 2 (SECISBP2) that alter the amino acid sequence or cause splicing defects lead to abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism. Herein, we present the first in silico and in vivo functional characterization of alternative splicing of SECISBP2. We report a complex splicing pattern in the 5'-region of human SECISBP2, wherein at least eight splice variants encode five isoforms with varying N-terminal sequence. One of the isoforms, mtSBP2, contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence and localizes to mitochondria. Using a minigene-based in vivo splicing assay we characterized the splicing efficiency of several alternative transcripts, and show that the splicing event that creates mtSBP2 can be modulated by antisense oligonucleotides. Moreover, we show that full-length SBP2 and some alternatively spliced variants are subject to a coordinated transcriptional and translational regulation in response to ultraviolet type A irradiation-induced stress. Overall, our data broadens the functional scope of a housekeeping protein essential to selenium metabolism.
3 Antibodies against Lagos bat virus in megachiroptera from West Africa. To investigate the presence of Lagos bat virus (LBV)-specific antibodies in megachiroptera from West Africa, we conducted fluorescent antibody virus neutralization tests. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in Eidolon helvum (37%), Epomophorus gambianus (3%), and Epomops buettikoferi (33%, 2/6) from Ghana. These findings confirm the presence of LBV in West Africa.
1 NetGrep: fast network schema searches in interactomes. NetGrep (http://genomics.princeton.edu/singhlab/netgrep/) is a system for searching protein interaction networks for matches to user-supplied 'network schemas'. Each schema consists of descriptions of proteins (for example, their molecular functions or putative domains) along with the desired topology and types of interactions among them. Schemas can thus describe domain-domain interactions, signaling and regulatory pathways, or more complex network patterns. NetGrep provides an advanced graphical interface for specifying schemas and fast algorithms for extracting their matches.
3 Rabies-related viruses. Five viruses related to rabies occur in Africa. Two of these, Obodhiang from Sudan and kotonkan from Nigeria, were found in insects and are only distantly related to rabies virus. The other three are antigenically more closely related to rabies. Mokola virus was isolated from shrews in Nigeria, Lagos bat virus from fruit bats in Nigeria, and Duvenhage virus from brain of a man bitten by a bat in South Africa. The public health significance of the rabies-related viruses was emphasized in Zimbabwe where in 1981 a rabies-related virus became epizootic in the dog and cat population. It is postulated that the ancestral origin of rabies virus was Africa where the greatest antigenic diversity occurs and that the ancestor may have been an insect virus. Questions are raised why rabies has not evolved more rapidly in the New World, given the frequency and ease with which antigenic changes can be induced in the laboratory, and how the virus became so extensively established in New World bats.
1 Polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the Cyclophilin A gene influence the susceptibility for HIV-1 infection. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of Cyclophilin A (CypA) and susceptibility to both HIV-1 infection and disease progression. Here we studied whether these polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and disease progression in the Amsterdam Cohort on HIV-1 infection and AIDS (ACS) in a group of men having sex with men (MSM) and drug users (DU). We screened participants of the ACS for the C1604G and A1650G polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of CypA. The prevalence of the 1650G allele was significantly higher in high risk seronegative MSM than in HIV-1 infected MSM. However, C1604G or A1650G were not associated with the clinical course of infection in MSM of the ACS. Interestingly, participants of the ACS-DU who carried the 1604G allele showed a significantly accelerated progression when viral RNA load above 10(4.5) copies per ml plasma was used as an endpoint in survival analysis. The results obtained in this study suggest that the A1650G polymorphism in the regulatory region of the CypA gene may be associated with protection from HIV-1 infection, while the 1604G allele may have a weak association with the clinical course of infection in DU.
3 Rabies postexposure prophylaxis, Marseille, France, 1994-2005. The administration of human rabies postexposure prophylaxis near Marseille (southern France) has changed since the eradication of terrestrial mammal rabies in 2001. Most injuries were associated with indigenous dogs; rabies vaccine was overprescribed. We suggest that the World Health Organization guidelines be adapted for countries free of terrestrial mammal rabies.
0 Binding interactions control SNARE specificity in vivo. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two SNAP25 paralogues, Sec9 and Spo20, which mediate vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane and the prospore membrane, respectively. Fusion at the prospore membrane is sensitive to perturbation of the central ionic layer of the SNARE complex. Mutation of the central glutamine of the t-SNARE Sso1 impaired sporulation, but does not affect vegetative growth. Suppression of the sporulation defect of an sso1 mutant requires expression of a chimeric form of Spo20 carrying the SNARE helices of Sec9. Mutation of two residues in one SNARE domain of Spo20 to match those in Sec9 created a form of Spo20 that restores sporulation in the presence of the sso1 mutant and can replace SEC9 in vegetative cells. This mutant form of Spo20 displayed enhanced activity in in vitro fusion assays, as well as tighter binding to Sso1 and Snc2. These results demonstrate that differences within the SNARE helices can discriminate between closely related SNAREs for function in vivo.
1 Outbreak of dengue and Chikungunya fevers, Toamasina, Madagascar, 2006. An outbreak of dengue-like syndrome occurred in Toamasina from January through March 2006. Dengue type l or chikungunya viruses were detected in 38 of 55 patients sampled. Aedes albopictus was the only potential vector collected. Of 4,242 randomly selected representative residents interviewed retrospectively, 67.5% reported a dengue-like syndrome during this period.
1 Pituitary-adrenal function in patients with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage: a prospective cohort study. Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) may damage the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) axis and disturb cortisol metabolism. There are no available data that relates to the response of the HPA axis in the acute phase of SAH. We aimed to characterise the behavior of serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), total cortisol, stimulated total cortisol and free cortisol concentrations in acute aneurysmal SAH. A prospective cohort study was conducted of patients with acute aneurysmal SAH (n = 30) admitted to a tertiary university hospital. Patients admitted for elective aneurysmal surgery (n = 16) served as the control group. An ACTH stimulation test was performed twice during the first week and at three months. The main outcome measure was description of the ACTH-cortisol response by calculating serum free cortisol and measuring total cortisol and ACTH concentrations. A mixed models method was used for testing between the groups, allowing heterogeneity between the groups. Patients with SAH had higher initial serum total cortisol (mean +/- SD; 793 +/- 312 nmol/L) and free cortisol concentrations (83 +/- 55 nmol/L) than control patients (535 +/- 193 nmol/L, p = 0.001 and 33 +/- 18 nmol/L, p < 0.001, respectively). Thereafter, there were no differences in this respect. Serum free and total cortisol concentrations correlated but were unaffected by the severity of SAH. ACTH concentrations were comparable between SAH and control groups. Patients with Hunt-Hess grades IV to V had higher ACTH concentrations at day one (10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol/l/L) and day five (8.2 +/- 7.7 pmol/L) than patients with grade I-III (day one: 3.8 +/- 2.0 pmol/L, p = 0.002; day five: 4.7 +/- 1.8 pmol/L, p = 0.04). Calculation of serum free cortisol concentration was not helpful in identifying patients with potential hypocortisolism. SAH severity did not affect cortisol concentrations, possibly indicating relative pituitary-adrenal insufficiency in patients with more severe bleeding. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00614887.
1 Clinical knee findings in floor layers with focus on meniscal status. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of self-reported and clinical knee morbidity among floor layers compared to a group of graphic designers, with special attention to meniscal status. We obtained information about knee complaints by questionnaire and conducted a bilateral clinical and radiographic knee examination in 134 male floor layers and 120 male graphic designers. After the exclusion of subjects with reports of earlier knee injuries the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of knee complaints and clinical findings were computed among floor layers compared to graphic designers, using logistic regression. Estimates were adjusted for effects of body mass index, age and knee straining sports. Using radiographic evaluations, we conducted side-specific sensitivity analyses regarding clinical signs of meniscal lesions after the exclusion of participants with tibiofemoral (TF) osteoarthritis (OA). Reports of knee pain (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.5-4.6), pain during stair walking (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.3-3.9) and symptoms of catching of the knee joint (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.4-5.7) were more prevalent among floor layers compared to graphic designers. Additionally, significant more floor layers than graphic designers had clinical signs suggesting possible meniscal lesions: a positive McMurray test (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1-5.0) and TF joint line tenderness (OR = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.4-12.0). Excluding floor layers (n = 22) and graphic designers (n = 15) with radiographic TF OA did not alter this trend between the two study groups: a positive McMurray test (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.0-4.9), TF joint line tenderness (OR = 5.0, 95% CI = 2.0-12.5). Results indicate that floor layers have a high prevalence of both self-reported and clinical knee morbidity. Clinical knee findings suggesting possible meniscal lesions were significant more prevalent among floor layers compared to a group of low-level exposed graphic designers and an association with occupational kneeling could be possible. However, causality cannot be confirmed due to the cross-sectional study design.
3 A system for cost and reimbursement control in hospitals. This paper approaches the design of a regional or statewide hospital rate-setting system as the underpinning of a larger system which permits a regulatory agency to satisfy the requirements of various public laws now on the books or in process. It aims to generate valid interinstitutional monitoring on the three parameters of cost, utilization, and quality review. Such an approach requires the extension of the usual departmental cost and budgeting system to include consideration of the mix of patients treated and the utilization of various resources, including patient days, in the treatment of these patients. A sampling framework for the application of process-based quality studies and the generation of selected performance measurements is also included.
1 Proficiency of nucleic acid tests for avian influenza viruses, Australasia. An avian influenza quality assurance program was used to provide information for laboratories on the sensitivity and specificity of their avian influenza nucleic acid testing. Most laboratories were able to correctly detect clinically relevant amounts of influenza virus (H5N1), and results improved as each subsequent panel was tested.
1 New opportunities for development of safe, effective live virus vaccines. Effective vaccines are not available for most viral diseases. This situation may soon change when the full force of contemporary molecular biology is applied to immunoprophylaxis. In certain viral diseases, particularly those affecting the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, live attenuated vaccines are needed to confer effective protection. Until now the major obstacle to success has been genetic instability. It may be possible to construct stable, satisfactorily attenuated mutants by cloning viral DNA or RNA and then subjecting the cloned DNA to enzyme surgery to create viable deletion mutations. Modified cloned DNA derived from positive-strand viral RNA could then be transferred back into its virus by transfection of cells. Conversion of mutant cloned DNA into negative-strand RNA and transfer into its virus will require a more elaborate type of rescue.
3 An incremental approach to automated protein localisation. The subcellular localisation of proteins in intact living cells is an important means for gaining information about protein functions. Even dynamic processes can be captured, which can barely be predicted based on amino acid sequences. Besides increasing our knowledge about intracellular processes, this information facilitates the development of innovative therapies and new diagnostic methods. In order to perform such a localisation, the proteins under analysis are usually fused with a fluorescent protein. So, they can be observed by means of a fluorescence microscope and analysed. In recent years, several automated methods have been proposed for performing such analyses. Here, two different types of approaches can be distinguished: techniques which enable the recognition of a fixed set of protein locations and methods that identify new ones. To our knowledge, a combination of both approaches--i.e. a technique, which enables supervised learning using a known set of protein locations and is able to identify and incorporate new protein locations afterwards--has not been presented yet. Furthermore, associated problems, e.g. the recognition of cells to be analysed, have usually been neglected. We introduce a novel approach to automated protein localisation in living cells. In contrast to well-known techniques, the protein localisation technique presented in this article aims at combining the two types of approaches described above: After an automatic identification of unknown protein locations, a potential user is enabled to incorporate them into the pre-trained system. An incremental neural network allows the classification of a fixed set of protein location as well as the detection, clustering and incorporation of additional patterns that occur during an experiment. Here, the proposed technique achieves promising results with respect to both tasks. In addition, the protein localisation procedure has been adapted to an existing cell recognition approach. Therefore, it is especially well-suited for high-throughput investigations where user interactions have to be avoided. We have shown that several aspects required for developing an automatic protein localisation technique--namely the recognition of cells, the classification of protein distribution patterns into a set of learnt protein locations, and the detection and learning of new locations--can be combined successfully. So, the proposed method constitutes a crucial step to render image-based protein localisation techniques amenable to large-scale experiments.
0 Unique Cryptosporidium population in HIV-infected persons, Jamaica. A cryptosporidiosis survey showed the presence of Cryptosporidium hominis, C. parvum, C. canis, and C. felis in 25, 7, 1, and 1 HIV-positive persons from Jamaica, respectively; 1 person had both C. hominis and C. felis. Multilocus sequence typing indicated the presence of a homogeneous but geographically distinct C. hominis population in Jamaica.
1 Cost-effectiveness of antiviral stockpiling and near-patient testing for potential influenza pandemic. A decision analytical model was developed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of stockpiling antiviral (AV) drugs for a potential influenza pandemic in the United Kingdom and the possible role of near-patient testing in conserving AV drug stocks. Under base-case assumptions (including a fixed stockpile that was smaller than the clinical attack rate), the treat-only option (treating all symptomatic patients with AV drugs) would be considered cost-effective ( pound1,900- pound13,700 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained, depending on the fatality scenario), compared with no intervention (nonintervention but management of cases as they arise). The test-treat option (testing all symptomatic patients but treating those with positive tests results only) would result in moderate gains in QALYs over the treat-only option but at relatively large additional costs. Stockpiling sufficient AV drugs (but not near-patient tests) to treat all patients with clinical cases would be cost-effective, provided AV drugs are effective at preventing deaths from pandemic influenza.
2 The sequential external counter pulsator: a circulatory assist device. THE THREE GOALS OF CARDIAC ASSISTANCE ARE: (1) To maintain systemic blood flow; (2) To reduce cardiac work and tension development; and (3) To increase oxygen availability to the heart. Toward these ends, various devices and techniques have been developed, including several different types of vascular shunts in combination with or without extracorporeal oxygenation of blood, implantable auxiliary ventricle and augmentation of diastolic pressure by direct counter pulsation of blood through femoral cannulae or intra-aortic balloon.The sequenced counter pulsator is an external cardiac assist device being developed for the therapy of low output syndromes. Investigation in the laboratory has shown that it is capable of increasing cardiac output and diastolic systemic pressure with concomitant reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Therefore, it appears to be clinically useful in patients with low cardiac output syndromes.
1 Identification and recovery of minor HIV-1 variants using the heteroduplex tracking assay and biotinylated probes. We describe a method to identify and recover minor human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequence variants from a complex population. The original heteroduplex tracking assay (HTA) was modified by incorporating a biotin tag into the probe to allow for direct sequence determination of the query strand. We used this approach to recover sequences from minor HIV-1 variants in the V3 region of the env gene, and to identify minor drug-resistant variants in pro. The biotin-HTA targeting of the V3 region of env allowed us to detect minor V3 variants, of which 45% were classified as CXCR4-using viruses. In addition, the biotin-protease HTA was able to detect mixtures of wild-type sequence and drug-resistance mutations in four subjects that were not detected by bulk sequence analysis. The biotin-HTA is a robust assay that first separates genetic variants then allows direct sequence analysis of major and minor variants.
3 Q fever update, Maritime Canada. Since the 1990s, reports of Q fever in Nova Scotia, Canada, have declined. Passive surveillance for Q fever in Nova Scotia and its neighboring provinces in eastern Canada indicates that the clinical manifestation of Q fever in the Maritime provinces is pneumonia and that incidence of the disease may fluctuate.
3 Virus transfer from personal protective equipment to healthcare employees' skin and clothing. We evaluated a personal protective equipment removal protocol designed to minimize wearer contamination with pathogens. Following this protocol often resulted in virus transfer to hands and clothing. An altered protocol or other measures are needed to prevent healthcare worker contamination.
2 FMRI connectivity analysis of acupuncture effects on an amygdala-associated brain network. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that the primary acupuncture effects are mediated by the central nervous system. However, specific brain networks underpinning these effects remain unclear. In the present study using fMRI, we employed a within-condition interregional covariance analysis method to investigate functional connectivity of brain networks involved in acupuncture. The fMRI experiment was performed before, during and after acupuncture manipulations on healthy volunteers at an acupuncture point, which was previously implicated in a neural pathway for pain modulation. We first identified significant fMRI signal changes during acupuncture stimulation in the left amygdala, which was subsequently selected as a functional reference for connectivity analyses. Our results have demonstrated that there is a brain network associated with the amygdala during a resting condition. This network encompasses the brain structures that are implicated in both pain sensation and pain modulation. We also found that such a pain-related network could be modulated by both verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture. Furthermore, compared with a sham acupuncture, the verum acupuncture induced a higher level of correlations among the amygdala-associated network. Our findings indicate that acupuncture may change this amygdala-specific brain network into a functional state that underlies pain perception and pain modulation.
3 Risk factors for sporadic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections in children, Argentina. We evaluated risk factors for sporadic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection among children in Argentina. We conducted a prospective case-control study in 2 sites and enrolled 150 case-patients and 299 controls. The median age of case-patients was 1.8 years; 58% were girls. Serotype O157:H7 was the most commonly isolated STEC. Exposures associated with infection included eating undercooked beef, living in or visiting a place with farm animals, and contact with a child <5 years of age with diarrhea. Protective factors included the respondent reporting that he or she always washed hands after handling raw beef and the child eating more than the median number of fruits and vegetables. Many STEC infections in children could be prevented by avoiding consumption of undercooked beef, limiting exposure to farm animals and their environment, not being exposed to children with diarrhea, and washing hands after handling raw beef.
1 Acute effects of ambient particulate matter on mortality in Europe and North America: results from the APHENA study. THE APHENA (AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTH: A Combined European and North American Approach) study is a collaborative analysis of multicity time-series data on the effect of air pollution on population health, bringing together data from the European APHEA (Air Pollution and Health: A European Approach) and U.S. NMMAPS (National Morbidity, Mortality and Air Pollution Study) projects, along with Canadian data. The main objective of APHENA was to assess the coherence of the findings of the multicity studies carried out in Europe and North America, when analyzed with a common protocol, and to explore sources of possible heterogeneity. We present APHENA results on the effects of particulate matter (PM) < or = 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)) on the daily number of deaths for all ages and for those < 75 and > or = 75 years of age. We explored the impact of potential environmental and socioeconomic factors that may modify this association. In the first stage of a two-stage analysis, we used Poisson regression models, with natural and penalized splines, to adjust for seasonality, with various degrees of freedom. In the second stage, we used meta-regression approaches to combine time-series results across cites and to assess effect modification by selected ecologic covariates. Air pollution risk estimates were relatively robust to different modeling approaches. Risk estimates from Europe and United States were similar, but those from Canada were substantially higher. The combined effect of PM(10) on all-cause mortality across all ages for cities with daily air pollution data ranged from 0.2% to 0.6% for a 10-microg/m(3) increase in ambient PM(10) concentration. Effect modification by other pollutants and climatic variables differed in Europe and the United States. In both of these regions, a higher proportion of older people and higher unemployment were associated with increased air pollution risk. Estimates of the increased mortality associated with PM air pollution based on the APHENA study were generally comparable with results of previous reports. Overall, risk estimates were similar in Europe and in the United States but higher in Canada. However, PM(10) effect modification patterns were somewhat different in Europe and the United States.
0 Beta-catenin is required for memory consolidation. beta-catenin has been implicated in neuronal synapse regulation and remodeling. Here we have examined beta-catenin expression in the adult mouse brain and its role in amygdala-dependent learning and memory. We found alterations in beta-catenin mRNA and protein phosphorylation during fear-memory consolidation. Such alterations correlated with a change in the association of beta-catenin with cadherin. Pharmacologically, this consolidation was enhanced by lithium-mediated facilitation of beta-catenin. Genetically, the role of beta-catenin was confirmed with site-specific deletions of loxP-flanked Ctnnb1 (encoding beta-catenin) in the amygdala. Baseline locomotion, anxiety-related behaviors and acquisition or expression of conditioned fear were normal. However, amygdala-specific deletion of Ctnnb1 prevented the normal transfer of newly formed fear learning into long-term memory. Thus, beta-catenin may be required in the amygdala for the normal consolidation, but not acquisition, of fear memory. This suggests a general role for beta-catenin in the synaptic remodeling and stabilization underlying long-term memory in adults.
3 Hepatic copper accumulation in primary biliary cirrhosis. Hepatic copper accumulation is a regular feature of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The levels are directly related to the clinical stage of the disease. Since the copper values in PBC are comparable to Wilson's disease, there is the potential for copper toxicity, although this is speculative since the two diseases differ in the binding, distribution, and intracellular localization of the copper. The involvement of copper toxicity in the progression of PBC is supported by the observation that the highest values occur in association with the hepatic failure that occurs in the advanced stage.Corticosteroid therapy appears to decrease hepatic copper levels in PBC. Although this therapy does not invariably lower the hepatic Cu content in patients with PBC, it does so in many individuals. Therapeutic trials with d-penicillamine are in progress. When results are available they will guide us in the management of individual patients with PBC. In the meantime, dietary copper should be restricted as is done in management of Wilson's disease.
0 Acute toxicity and prothrombotic effects of quantum dots: impact of surface charge. Quantum dots (QDs) have numerous possible applications for in vivo imaging. However, toxicity data are scarce. To determine the acute in vivo toxicity of QDs with carboxyl surface coating (carboxyl-QDs) and QDs with amine surface coating (amine-QDs), we investigated the inflammatory properties, tissue distribution, and prothrombotic effects after intravenous injection. We performed particle characterization by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Carboxyl-QDs and amine-QDs were intravenously injected in mice (1.44-3,600 pmol/mouse). At different time intervals, analyses included fluorescence microscopy, blood cell analysis, bronchoalveolar lavage, wet and dry organ weights, and cadmium concentration in various organs. We examined the prothrombotic effects in vivo by assessing the effect of pretreatment with the anticoagulant heparin and by measuring platelet activation (P-selectin), and in vitro by platelet aggregation in murine and human platelet-rich plasma exposed to QDs (1.44-1,620 pmol/mL). At doses of 3,600 and 720 pmol/mouse, QDs caused marked vascular thrombosis in the pulmonary circulation, especially with carboxyl-QDs. We saw an effect of surface charge for all the parameters tested. QDs were mainly found in lung, liver, and blood. Thrombotic complications were abolished, and P-selectin was not affected by pretreatment of the animals with heparin. In vitro, carboxyl-QDs and amine-QDs enhanced adenosine-5'-diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation. At high doses, QDs caused pulmonary vascular thrombosis, most likely by activating the coagulation cascade via contact activation. Our study highlights the need for careful safety evaluation of QDs before their use in human applications. Furthermore, it is clear that surface charge is an important parameter in nanotoxicity.
2 Chemotherapy of lung cancer. The potential for substantial improvement in the outcome of patients with carcinoma of the lung seem most likely to develop in the field of chemotherapy. In the past decade, striking advances in the management of small cell carcinoma have yielded response rates and longer survival. While the greatest improvement can be predicted for patients whose disease is limited in extent, combination chemotherapy and combined modality therapy generally are effective in causing tumor regression for the majority of patients. About 20 percent of patients with disease limited to the thorax and lymph nodes will survive two years. In non-small cell tumors, response rates are improved with intensive drug combinations, although the majority of cases are unresponsive to present regimens. Careful staging and evaluation of patients indicates that patients with good performance status and limited extent of disease appear to obtain the most benefit from intensive treatment. The considerable morbidity of some treatments often influences the choice for or against chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell carcinomas. For the future, problems of particular interest will be in investigation of factors-biologic, pharmacokinetic, immunologic-that are related to the failure to cure small cell carcinoma, the most therapeutically responsive pulmonary tumor. Additionally, in the non-small cell tumors, more effective therapies as well as clarification of the basis for relative resistance to cytotoxic agents are areas for intensive investigation.
1 Self-interest versus group-interest in antiviral control. Antiviral agents have been hailed to hold considerable promise for the treatment and prevention of emerging viral diseases like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS. However, antiviral drugs are not completely harmless, and the conditions under which individuals are willing to participate in a large-scale antiviral drug treatment program are as yet unknown. We provide population dynamical and game theoretical analyses of large-scale prophylactic antiviral treatment programs. Throughout we compare the antiviral control strategy that is optimal from the public health perspective with the control strategy that would evolve if individuals make their own, rational decisions. To this end we investigate the conditions under which a large-scale antiviral control program can prevent an epidemic, and we analyze at what point in an unfolding epidemic the risk of infection starts to outweigh the cost of antiviral treatment. This enables investigation of how the optimal control strategy is moulded by the efficacy of antiviral drugs, the risk of mortality by antiviral prophylaxis, and the transmissibility of the pathogen. Our analyses show that there can be a strong incentive for an individual to take less antiviral drugs than is optimal from the public health perspective. In particular, when public health asks for early and aggressive control to prevent or curb an emerging pathogen, for the individual antiviral drug treatment is attractive only when the risk of infection has become non-negligible. It is even possible that from a public health perspective a situation in which everybody takes antiviral drugs is optimal, while the process of individual choice leads to a situation where nobody is willing to take antiviral drugs.
1 Probe signal correction for differential methylation hybridization experiments. Non-biological signal (or noise) has been the bane of microarray analysis. Hybridization effects related to probe-sequence composition and DNA dye-probe interactions have been observed in differential methylation hybridization (DMH) microarray experiments as well as other effects inherent to the DMH protocol. We suggest two models to correct for non-biologically relevant probe signal with an overarching focus on probe-sequence composition. The estimated effects are evaluated and the strengths of the models are considered in the context of DMH analyses. The majority of estimated parameters were statistically significant in all considered models. Model selection for signal correction is based on interpretation of the estimated values and their biological significance.
2 Association between inflammatory mediators and response to inhaled nitric oxide in a model of endotoxin-induced lung injury. Inhaled nitric oxide (INO) allows selective pulmonary vasodilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome and improves PaO2 by redistribution of pulmonary blood flow towards better ventilated parenchyma. One-third of patients are nonresponders to INO, however, and it is difficult to predict who will respond. The aim of the present study was to identify, within a panel of inflammatory mediators released during endotoxin-induced lung injury, specific mediators that are associated with a PaO2 response to INO. After animal ethics committee approval, pigs were anesthetized and exposed to 2 hours of endotoxin infusion. Levels of cytokines, prostanoid, leucotriene and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were sampled prior to endotoxin exposure and hourly thereafter. All animals were exposed to 40 ppm INO: 28 animals were exposed at either 4 hours or 6 hours and a subgroup of nine animals was exposed both at 4 hours and 6 hours after onset of endotoxin infusion. Based on the response to INO, the animals were retrospectively placed into a responder group (increase in PaO2 > or = 20%) or a nonresponder group. All mediators increased with endotoxin infusion although no significant differences were seen between responders and nonresponders. There was a mean difference in ET-1, however, with lower levels in the nonresponder group than in the responder group, 0.1 pg/ml versus 3.0 pg/ml. Moreover, five animals in the group exposed twice to INO switched from responder to nonresponder and had decreased ET-1 levels (3.0 (2.5 to 7.5) pg/ml versus 0.1 (0.1 to 2.1) pg/ml, P < 0.05). The pulmonary artery pressure and ET-1 level were higher in future responders to INO. ET-1 may therefore be involved in mediating the response to INO.
0 A fatal hyperpyrexial response to bleomycin following prior therapy: a case report and literature review. Bleomycin is an effective drug used in the therapy of many malignant diseases. Such toxicities as fever, chills, and pulmonary fibrosis are well known to occur following administration of this drug. A rare fatal hyperpyrexial response has also been noted with this agent. We describe a case of fatal hyperthermia after an injection of bleomycin. Unlike earlier reported cases, our patient developed her reaction following prior uneventful therapy with bleomycin rather than as a response to initial treatment. Factors that may be related to the hyperpyrexial response to bleomycin are discussed and the relevant literature reviewed.
3 Comparison of human and bovine protoporphyria. Protoporphyria (PP) is an inherited disorder of porphyrin metabolism in man in which there is excessive accumulation and excretion of protoporphyrin. Recently, a similar disorder has been described in cattle. In this report, the clinical, biochemical, and genetic features of bovine and human PP are compared. Human and bovine PP are characterized by photosensitivity and elevation of erythrocyte and fecal protoporphyrin levels. In both disorders, a deficiency of heme synthase activity is present in all tissues which have been examined. The diseases differ clinically in that hepatobiliary disease has been found thus far only in human PP. They also have different inheritance patterns. Human PP is an autosomal dominant disease, while initial studies strongly suggest that there is an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance in bovine PP.
0 Role for perinuclear chromosome tethering in maintenance of genome stability. Repetitive DNA sequences, which constitute half the genome in some organisms, often undergo homologous recombination. This can instigate genomic instability resulting from a gain or loss of DNA. Assembly of DNA into silent chromatin is generally thought to serve as a mechanism ensuring repeat stability by limiting access to the recombination machinery. Consistent with this notion is the observation, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that stability of the highly repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences requires a Sir2-containing chromatin silencing complex that also inhibits transcription from foreign promoters and transposons inserted within the repeats by a process called rDNA silencing. Here we describe a protein network that stabilizes rDNA repeats of budding yeast by means of interactions between rDNA-associated silencing proteins and two proteins of the inner nuclear membrane (INM). Deletion of either the INM or silencing proteins reduces perinuclear rDNA positioning, disrupts the nucleolus-nucleoplasm boundary, induces the formation of recombination foci, and destabilizes the repeats. In addition, artificial targeting of rDNA repeats to the INM suppresses the instability observed in cells lacking an rDNA-associated silencing protein that is typically required for peripheral tethering of the repeats. Moreover, in contrast to Sir2 and its associated nucleolar factors, the INM proteins are not required for rDNA silencing, indicating that Sir2-dependent silencing is not sufficient to inhibit recombination within the rDNA locus. These findings demonstrate a role for INM proteins in the perinuclear localization of chromosomes and show that tethering to the nuclear periphery is required for the stability of rDNA repeats. The INM proteins studied here are conserved and have been implicated in chromosome organization in metazoans. Our results therefore reveal an ancient mechanism in which interactions between INM proteins and chromosomal proteins ensure genome stability.
2 Effects of circulating red cell mass on diet-induced atrial thrombosis in mice. Atrial thrombosis is a common lesion in female Taconic Swiss mice fed a high-fat (28%), low-protein (8%), hypolipotropic diet for 10 wk or longer. After the third week of such feeding the mice studied here were injected with either erythropoietin, washed, packed red blood cells, lysed red blood cells, plasma or physiological saline.In mice receiving injections of lysed red cells, plasma or saline, respectively 75, 54 and 82% of those surviving for 10 wk had developed atrial thrombosis. Hematocrits were 9.3% or below in these groups. Hematocrits were maintained at an average of 33.0% in the erythropoietin group and 32.4% in the transfused (packed erythrocytes) group. Only one of the erythropoietin injected animals and none of the transfused animals developed atrial thrombosis. The evidence indicates that the anemia induced by the experimental diet results from lack of erythropoietin production or activity and that the hypoxia of anemia plays a role in the development of atrial thrombosis.
0 Immortalization of human lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr virus. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) confers upon normal lymphocytes derived from bone marrow the ability to proliferate indefinitely in a test tube. This process, called immortalization, is crucial to the pathogenesis of EBV infections. Inside the immortalized lymphocyte the EBV genome exists as a complete multicopy circular plasmid which is probably not integrated into the cell chromosome. Most of the viral genetic information is not expressed. However, at least six to eight separate regions of the EBV genome encode viral products which are made in the immortalized cell. The identification of the function of these few genes holds some interesting answers to questions concerning the biochemical mechanisms of control of lymphocyte growth and differentiation.
1 Gamma power is phase-locked to posterior alpha activity. Neuronal oscillations in various frequency bands have been reported in numerous studies in both humans and animals. While it is obvious that these oscillations play an important role in cognitive processing, it remains unclear how oscillations in various frequency bands interact. In this study we have investigated phase to power locking in MEG activity of healthy human subjects at rest with their eyes closed. To examine cross-frequency coupling, we have computed coherence between the time course of the power in a given frequency band and the signal itself within every channel. The time-course of the power was calculated using a sliding tapered time window followed by a Fourier transform. Our findings show that high-frequency gamma power (30-70 Hz) is phase-locked to alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) in the ongoing MEG signals. The topography of the coupling was similar to the topography of the alpha power and was strongest over occipital areas. Interestingly, gamma activity per se was not evident in the power spectra and only became detectable when studied in relation to the alpha phase. Intracranial data from an epileptic subject confirmed these findings albeit there was slowing in both the alpha and gamma band. A tentative explanation for this phenomenon is that the visual system is inhibited during most of the alpha cycle whereas a burst of gamma activity at a specific alpha phase (e.g. at troughs) reflects a window of excitability.
0 Utility of ranolazine in chronic stable angina patients. Chronic stable angina is a debilitating illness affecting at least 6.6 million US residents. Despite being optimally treated by pharmacotherapy and revascularization up to 26% of patients still experience angina. Diabetes mellitus is a common co-morbid condition in angina patients. Several new investigational medications are being tested for chronic angina. Advances in understanding of myocardial ischemia have prompted evaluation of a number of new antianginal strategies. In this review we discuss the utility of ranolazine, a recently approved novel antianginal agent and its efficacy in the diabetic patient population. In addition to its antianginal action in diabetic patients with chronic angina, ranolazine may have favorable effects on glycated hemoglobin levels.
1 Determination of RBC membrane and serum lipid composition in Trinidadian type II diabetics with and without nephropathy. The rheological properties of erythrocytes are impaired in diabetes mellitus, especially because of changes in their membrane lipid composition.The aim of this study was to determine and examine the relationship between red blood cell (RBC) membrane and serum lipid composition in type II diabetes subjects with and without nephropathy. Trinidadian subjects aged 18-65 years were recruited for the study regardless of gender and ethnicity. Fasting blood samples were collected from 60 subjects of whom 20 were healthy individuals, 20 had type II diabetes without complications, and 20 were type II diabetics with nephropathy. Weight, height, waist/hip ratio, and blood pressure were recorded. All the blood samples were analysed to determine the serum lipid concentration, membrane lipid composition and plasma glucose concentration. The body mass index and the systolic blood pressure of the diabetics (28.17 +/- 4.98 kg/m2, 153.21 +/- 22.10 mmHg) and those with nephropathy (25.87 +/- 4.68, 158.60 +/- 22.49 mmHg) were higher when compared with controls (24.67 +/- 5.18, 119.15 +/- 13.03 mmHg). The diabetic (175.89 +/- 102.73 microg/mgprotein) and diabetic nephropathy (358.80 +/- 262.66) subjects showed significantly higher levels of RBC membrane cholesterol compared with controls (132.27 +/- 66.47). The membrane phospholipids, protein and Na+/K+ATPase concentrations were altered in diabetics and diabetic nephropathy patients when compared with controls. The trends of increased serum cholesterol and decreased high-density lipoprotein in diabetics and diabetic nephropathy patients were noted as compared with controls but they are not significant as expected. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly higher in diabetics when compared with diabetic nephropathy and control subjects. Our data suggest that there is a relationship between RBC membrane and serum lipid composition in subjects with type II diabetes with and without nephropathy. This relationship shows that diet and lifestyle plays a significant role in the alterations of the lipids both in serum and RBC membrane. The membrane and serum lipid composition may be used as possible indicators for type II diabetic patients with and without nephropathy to control their diet in the beginning stages to prevent them from further complications.
0 Causation and disease: the Henle-Koch postulates revisited. The Henle-Koch postulates are reviewed in terms of their full validity in Koch's day and in light of subsequent developments. The changing guidelines developed for viral diseases, for viruses in relation to cancer and to chronic central nervous system infection, and for causative agents in chronic diseases are discussed chronologically. A set of guidelines for both acute infectious and chronic diseases is presented. The need for recognizing the role of the host and the spectrum of host responses, for sound biologic sense in evaluating causal roles of agents in disease, and for flexibility in adapting our guidelines to new knowledge are emphasized.
1 Magpies as hosts for West Nile virus, southern France. European magpies (Pica pica) from southern France were tested for antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) and viral shedding in feces during spring-autumn 2005. Results suggest that this peridomestic species may be a suitable sentinel species and a relevant target for additional investigations on WNV ecology in Europe.
1 Fractional differentiation by neocortical pyramidal neurons. Neural systems adapt to changes in stimulus statistics. However, it is not known how stimuli with complex temporal dynamics drive the dynamics of adaptation and the resulting firing rate. For single neurons, it has often been assumed that adaptation has a single time scale. We found that single rat neocortical pyramidal neurons adapt with a time scale that depends on the time scale of changes in stimulus statistics. This multiple time scale adaptation is consistent with fractional order differentiation, such that the neuron's firing rate is a fractional derivative of slowly varying stimulus parameters. Biophysically, even though neuronal fractional differentiation effectively yields adaptation with many time scales, we found that its implementation required only a few properly balanced known adaptive mechanisms. Fractional differentiation provides single neurons with a fundamental and general computation that can contribute to efficient information processing, stimulus anticipation and frequency-independent phase shifts of oscillatory neuronal firing.
3 Radon and risk of extrapulmonary cancers: results of the German uranium miners' cohort study, 1960-2003. Data from the German miners' cohort study were analysed to investigate whether radon in ambient air causes cancers other than lung cancer. The cohort includes 58,987 men who were employed for at least 6 months from 1946 to 1989 at the former Wismut uranium mining company in Eastern Germany. A total of 20,684 deaths were observed in the follow-up period from 1960 to 2003. The death rates for 24 individual cancer sites were compared with the age and calendar year-specific national death rates. Internal Poisson regression was used to estimate the excess relative risk (ERR) per unit of cumulative exposure to radon in working level months (WLM). The number of deaths observed (O) for extrapulmonary cancers combined was close to that expected (E) from national rates (n=3340, O/E=1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98-1.05). Statistically significant increases in mortality were recorded for cancers of the stomach (O/E=1.15; 95% CI: 1.06-1.25) and liver (O/E=1.26; 95% CI: 1.07-1.48), whereas significant decreases were found for cancers of the tongue, mouth, salivary gland and pharynx combined (O/E=0.80; 95% CI: 0.65-0.97) and those of the bladder (O/E=0.82; 95% CI: 0.70-0.95). A statistically significant relationship with cumulative radon exposure was observed for all extrapulmonary cancers (ERR/WLM=0.014%; 95% CI: 0.006-0.023%). Most sites showed positive exposure-response relationships, but these were insignificant or became insignificant after adjustment for potential confounders such as arsenic or dust exposure. The present data provide some evidence of increased risk of extrapulmonary cancers associated with radon, but chance and confounding cannot be ruled out.
3 Phenobarbital increases spontaneous transmitter release at the frog neuromuscular junction. Phenobarbital (1-2 × 10(-4)M) markedly increases the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials at the neuromuscular synapse of the frog. This effect was seen in calcium free media containing EGTA. The drug probably acts presynaptically at an intracellular locus to increase the presynaptic free calcium concentration.
0 Phosphorylation regulates SIRT1 function. SIR2 is an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase [1]-[3] implicated in the regulation of lifespan in species as diverse as yeast [4], worms [5], and flies [6]. We previously reported that the level of SIRT1, the mammalian homologue of SIR2 [7], [8], is coupled to the level of mitotic activity in cells both in vitro and in vivo[9]. Cells from long-lived mice maintained SIRT1 levels of young mice in tissues that undergo continuous cell replacement by proliferating stem cells. Changes in SIRT1 protein level were not associated with changes in mRNA level, suggesting that SIRT1 could be regulated post-transcriptionally. However, other than a recent report on sumoylation [10] and identification of SIRT1 as a nuclear phospho-protein by mass spectrometry [11], post-translational modifications of this important protein have not been reported. We identified 13 residues in SIRT1 that are phosphorylated in vivo using mass spectrometry. Dephosphorylation by phosphatases in vitro resulted in decreased NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase activity. We identified cyclinB/Cdk1 as a cell cycle-dependent kinase that forms a complex with and phosphorylates SIRT1. Mutation of two residues phosphorylated by Cyclin B/Cdk1 (threonine 530 and serine 540) disturbs normal cell cycle progression and fails to rescue proliferation defects in SIRT1-deficient cells [12], [13]. Pharmacological manipulation of SIRT1 activity is currently being tested as a means of extending lifespan in mammals. Treatment of obese mice with resveratrol, a pharmacological activator of SIRT1, modestly but significantly improved longevity and, perhaps more importantly, offered some protection against the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome [14]-[16]. Understanding the endogenous mechanisms that regulate the level and activity of SIRT1, therefore, has obvious relevance to human health and disease. Our results identify phosphorylation by cell cycle dependent kinases as a major mechanism controlling the level and function of this sirtuin and complement recent reports of factors that inhibit [17], [18] and activate [19] SIRT1 by protein-protein interactions.
1 Molecular typing of Trypanosoma cruzi isolates, United States. Studies have characterized Trypanosoma cruzi from parasite-endemic regions. With new human cases, increasing numbers of veterinary cases, and influx of potentially infected immigrants, understanding the ecology of this organism in the United States is imperative. We used a classic typing scheme to determine the lineage of 107 isolates from various hosts.
1 Evaluation of regression methods when immunological measurements are constrained by detection limits. The statistical analysis of immunological data may be complicated because precise quantitative levels cannot always be determined. Values below a given detection limit may not be observed (nondetects), and data with nondetects are called left-censored. Since nondetects cannot be considered as missing at random, a statistician faced with data containing these nondetects must decide how to combine nondetects with detects. Till now, the common practice is to impute each nondetect with a single value such as a half of the detection limit, and to conduct ordinary regression analysis. The first aim of this paper is to give an overview of methods to analyze, and to provide new methods handling censored data other than an (ordinary) linear regression. The second aim is to compare these methods by simulation studies based on real data. We compared six new and existing methods: deletion of nondetects, single substitution, extrapolation by regression on order statistics, multiple imputation using maximum likelihood estimation, tobit regression, and logistic regression. The deletion and extrapolation by regression on order statistics methods gave biased parameter estimates. The single substitution method underestimated variances, and logistic regression suffered loss of power. Based on simulation studies, we found that tobit regression performed well when the proportion of nondetects was less than 30%, and that taken together the multiple imputation method performed best. Based on simulation studies, the newly developed multiple imputation method performed consistently well under different scenarios of various proportion of nondetects, sample sizes and even in the presence of heteroscedastic errors.
0 Growth on an arteriovenous malformation: a case report. A case of an intracerebral arteriovenous malformation that grew is presented. On the initial arteriogram only one early filling vein was seen in the region where a large arteriovenous malformation was present eight years later. The patient's headaches were relieved by antihypertensive medications. The authors speculate that distension of the AVM caused the headaches.
2 Declining artesunate-mefloquine efficacy against falciparum malaria on the Cambodia-Thailand border. Resistance to many antimalaria drugs developed on the Cambodia-Thailand border long before developing elsewhere. Because antimalaria resistance is now a global problem, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the first-line therapies in most malaria-endemic countries. However, recent clinical and molecular studies suggest the emergence of ACT-resistant Plasmodium falciparum infections in the Cambodia-Thailand border area, where standard ACT is artesunate and mefloquine. These ACT failures might be caused by high-level mefloquine resistance because mefloquine was used for monotherapy long before the introduction of ACT. This observation raises 2 questions. First, how can existing P. falciparum-resistant strains be controlled? Second, how can the evolution of new ACT- resistant strains be avoided elsewhere, e.g., in Africa? Enforcement of rational drug use and improved diagnostic capacity are among the measures needed to avoid and contain ACT resistance.
1 The 'cardiac-lung mass' artifact: an echocardiographic sign of lung atelectasis and/or pleural effusion. We conducted an ultrasound study to investigate echocardiographic artifacts in mechanically ventilated patients with lung pathology. A total of 205 mechanically ventilated patients who exhibited lung atelectasis and/or pleural effusion were included in this 36-month study. The patients underwent lung echography and transthoracic echocardiography, with a linear 5 to 10 MHz and with a 1.5 to 3.6 MHz wide-angle phased-array transducer, respectively. Patients were examined by two experienced observers who were blinded to each other's interpretation. A total of 124 patients (60,48%) were hospitalized because of multiple trauma; 60 patients (29,26%) because of respiratory insufficiency, and 21 (10,24%) because of recent postoperative surgery. The mean duration ( +/- standard deviation) of hospitalization was 35 +/- 27 days. An intracardiac artifact was documented in 17 out of 205 patients (8.29%) by echocardiography. It was visible only in the apical views, whereas subsequent transesophageal echocardiography revealed no abnormalities. The artifact consisted of a mobile component that exhibited, on M-mode, a pattern of respiratory variation similar to the lung 'sinusoid sign'. Lung echography revealed lung atelectasis and/or pleural effusion adjacent to the heart, and a similar M-mode pattern was observed. The artifact was recorded within the left cardiac chambers in 11 cases and within the right cardiac chambers in six. Lung atelectasis and/or pleural effusion may create a mirror image, intracardiac artifact in mechanically ventilated patients. The latter was named the 'cardiac-lung mass' artifact to underline the important diagnostic role of both echocardiography and lung echography in these patients. This trial is ISRCTN registered: ISRCTN 49216096.
3 Bacteremia due to Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium or Lactobacillus; twenty-one cases and review of the literature. Twenty-one cases of bacteremia due to Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium and Lactobacillus are described. Transient bacteremic episodes with these organisms may follow trauma to the mouth, intestine, or vagina. The majority of the patients were female and most had an underlying condition that may have predisposed to bacteremia. Ten of the patients died despite antibiotic treatment.
0 Circulatory and temperature regulatory responses to exercise in a warm environment in insulin-dependent diabetics. Because diabetics are prone to the development of neuropathy and microvascular disease, abnormalities of cardiovascular reactivity and capillary permeability in response to acute exercise and/or an increase in environmental temperature might presage the development of clinically overt complications. In the present study insulin-dependent diabetics without evidence of microangiopathy or neuropathy and controls matched for the same level of physical fitness performed cycle ergometer exercise for 20 minutes at 65 percent VO2 max in a temperature maintained at 35 percent C. Ther rise in heart rate (82-85 beats min-1), the fall in plasma volume (11-13 percent), and the increase in total serum proteins (13-16 percent) induced by exercise were the same in the two groups. Furthermore, comparable increments in skin blood flow (two- to threefold) and in core and skin temperatures were observed. The relationship between increases in body core temperature and increases in skin blood flow and the vasodilatory threshold (37.0 percent C) were also the same in the diabetics and controls.
0 A novel gene, fudoh, in the SCCmec region suppresses the colony spreading ability and virulence of Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus colonies can spread on soft agar plates. We compared colony spreading of clinically isolated methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). All MSSA strains showed colony spreading, but most MRSA strains (73%) carrying SCCmec type-II showed little colony spreading. Deletion of the entire SCCmec type-II region from these MRSA strains restored colony spreading. Introduction of a novel gene, fudoh, carried by SCCmec type-II into Newman strain suppressed colony spreading. MRSA strains with high spreading ability (27%) had no fudoh or a point-mutated fudoh that did not suppress colony spreading. The fudoh-transformed Newman strain had decreased exotoxin production and attenuated virulence in mice. Most community-acquired MRSA strains carried SCCmec type-IV, which does not include fudoh, and showed high colony spreading ability. These findings suggest that fudoh in the SCCmec type-II region suppresses colony spreading and exotoxin production, and is involved in S. aureus pathogenesis.
3 Burkholderia pseudomallei antibodies in children, Cambodia. Antibodies to Burkholderia pseudomallei were detected in 16% of children in Siem Reap, Cambodia. This organism was isolated from 30% of rice paddies in the surrounding vicinity. Despite the lack of reported indigenous cases, melioidosis is likely to occur in Cambodia.
3 Ten years of addressing children's health through regulatory policy at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Executive Order (EO) 13045, Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks, directs each federal agency to ensure that its policies, programs, activities, and standards address disproportionate environmental health and safety risks to children. We reviewed regulatory actions published by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Federal Register from April 1998 through December 2006 to evaluate applicability of EO 13045 to U.S. EPA actions and consideration of children's health issues in U.S. EPA rulemakings. Although virtually all actions discussed EO 13045, fewer than two regulations per year, on average, were subject to the EO requirement to evaluate children's environmental health risks. Nonetheless, U.S. EPA considered children's environmental health in all actions addressing health or safety risks that may disproportionately affect children. The EO does not apply to a broad enough set of regulatory actions to ensure protection of children's health and safety risks, largely because of the small number of rules that are economically significant. However, given the large number of regulations that consider children's health issues despite not being subject to the EO, other statutory requirements and agency policies reach a larger set of regulations to ensure protection of children's environmental health.
3 Intensive care for the adult population in Ireland: a multicentre study of intensive care population demographics. This prospective observational study was conducted to describe the nature of the intensive care population across Ireland, identify adherence to international benchmarks of practice, and describe patient outcomes in critically ill patients. A prospective observational multicentre study of demographics and organ failure incidence was carried out over a 10-week period in 2006 across the intensive care units (ICUs) of 14 hospitals in both the Republic and Northern Ireland. In total, there were 1,029 patient episodes entered across 14 ICUs. Emergency admissions accounted for 70% of episodes. Admissions after major elective surgery accounted for 20.5% of admissions. The mean length of ICU stay was 5.7 days, with a median of 2 days. Severe sepsis was identified in 35% of patients during their ICU admission. Mechanical ventilation was used in 70.7% of all patients admitted, of whom 26.9% had acute lung injury. Acute kidney injury occurred in 28% of all patients. Interhospital transfers were undertaken in 85 (8.3%) patients. The overall intensive care mortality of the study population was 19%. Intensive care medicine in Ireland serves a patient population with high requirement for mechanical ventilation and support of the function of multiple organs. The overall mortality compares favourably with international benchmarks.
0 Neuropeptide Y gene polymorphisms confer risk of early-onset atherosclerosis. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a strong candidate gene for coronary artery disease (CAD). We have previously identified genetic linkage to familial CAD in the genomic region of NPY. We performed follow-up genetic, biostatistical, and functional analysis of NPY in early-onset CAD. In familial CAD (GENECARD, N = 420 families), we found increased microsatellite linkage to chromosome 7p14 (OSA LOD = 4.2, p = 0.004) in 97 earliest age-of-onset families. Tagged NPY SNPs demonstrated linkage to CAD of a 6-SNP block (LOD = 1.58-2.72), family-based association of this block with CAD (p = 0.02), and stronger linkage to CAD in the earliest age-of-onset families. Association of this 6-SNP block with CAD was validated in: (a) 556 non-familial early-onset CAD cases and 256 controls (OR 1.46-1.65, p = 0.01-0.05), showing stronger association in youngest cases (OR 1.84-2.20, p = 0.0004-0.09); and (b) GENECARD probands versus non-familial controls (OR 1.79-2.06, p = 0.003-0.02). A promoter SNP (rs16147) within this 6-SNP block was associated with higher plasma NPY levels (p = 0.04). To assess a causal role of NPY in atherosclerosis, we applied the NPY1-receptor-antagonist BIBP-3226 adventitially to endothelium-denuded carotid arteries of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice; treatment reduced atherosclerotic neointimal area by 50% (p = 0.03). Thus, NPY variants associate with atherosclerosis in two independent datasets (with strong age-of-onset effects) and show allele-specific expression with NPY levels, while NPY receptor antagonism reduces atherosclerosis in mice. We conclude that NPY contributes to atherosclerosis pathogenesis.
2 Field application of a subunit vaccine against an enteric protozoan disease. Coccidiosis is a major global veterinary health problem in intensively reared chickens. It is caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Eimeria. A subunit vaccine composed of purified antigens from the gametocytes of Eimeria maxima was used to stimulate the production and transfer of maternal antibodies between breeding hens and their hatchlings. The vaccine was injected into hens twice before they began laying eggs. Immunization had no adverse affects on egg laying or health of the hens and resulted in high antibody levels throughout the life of the hens. Progeny of immunized hens excreted significantly less oocysts of various species of Eimeria in their faeces than chicks from unvaccinated hens. Furthermore, the offspring of vaccinated hens developed stronger natural immunity to Eimeria, so that they were resistant to challenge infection even at 8 weeks of age, well after all maternal antibodies had left their circulation. Field trials were conducted in South Africa, Brazil and Thailand, involving at least 1 million progeny of vaccinated hens and at least 1 million positive control birds (raised on feed containing anticoccidial drugs or immunized with a live vaccine) in each country. Additionally, trials were carried out in Israel involving 60 million progeny of vaccinated hens and 112 million positive control birds. There were no significant differences in growth rate, feed conversion ratios or mortality in the offspring of vaccinated hens compared with the positive control chickens in any of these countries regardless of different management practices, different breeds of chickens or climate. These results demonstrate that a vaccine composed of antigens purified from the gametocytes of Eimeria can be used safely and effectively to prevent the deleterious effects of coccidiosis. It is the first subunit vaccine against any protozoan parasite to be successfully applied on a commercial scale.
0 The genetic architecture of fitness in a seed beetle: assessing the potential for indirect genetic benefits of female choice. Quantifying the amount of standing genetic variation in fitness represents an empirical challenge. Unfortunately, the shortage of detailed studies of the genetic architecture of fitness has hampered progress in several domains of evolutionary biology. One such area is the study of sexual selection. In particular, the evolution of adaptive female choice by indirect genetic benefits relies on the presence of genetic variation for fitness. Female choice by genetic benefits fall broadly into good genes (additive) models and compatibility (non-additive) models where the strength of selection is dictated by the genetic architecture of fitness. To characterize the genetic architecture of fitness, we employed a quantitative genetic design (the diallel cross) in a population of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, which is known to exhibit post-copulatory female choice. From reciprocal crosses of inbred lines, we assayed egg production, egg-to-adult survival, and lifetime offspring production of the outbred F1 daughters (F1 productivity). We used the bio model to estimate six components of genetic and environmental variance in fitness. We found sizeable additive and non-additive genetic variance in F1 productivity, but lower genetic variance in egg-to-adult survival, which was strongly influenced by maternal and paternal effects. Our results show that, in order to gain a relevant understanding of the genetic architecture of fitness, measures of offspring fitness should be inclusive and should include quantifications of offspring reproductive success. We note that our estimate of additive genetic variance in F1 productivity (CVA=14%) is sufficient to generate indirect selection on female choice. However, our results also show that the major determinant of offspring fitness is the genetic interaction between parental genomes, as indicated by large amounts of non-additive genetic variance (dominance and/or epistasis) for F1 productivity. We discuss the processes that may maintain additive and non-additive genetic variance for fitness and how these relate to indirect selection for female choice.
1 Early detection of erlotinib treatment response in NSCLC by 3'-deoxy-3'-[F]-fluoro-L-thymidine ([F]FLT) positron emission tomography (PET). Inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has shown clinical success in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Somatic mutations of EGFR were found in lung adenocarcinoma that lead to exquisite dependency on EGFR signaling; thus patients with EGFR-mutant tumors are at high chance of response to EGFR inhibitors. However, imaging approaches affording early identification of tumor response in EGFR-dependent carcinomas have so far been lacking. We performed a systematic comparison of 3'-Deoxy-3'-[(18)F]-fluoro-L-thymidine ([(18)F]FLT) and 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for their potential to identify response to EGFR inhibitors in a model of EGFR-dependent lung cancer early after treatment initiation. While erlotinib-sensitive tumors exhibited a striking and reproducible decrease in [(18)F]FLT uptake after only two days of treatment, [(18)F]FDG PET based imaging revealed no consistent reduction in tumor glucose uptake. In sensitive tumors, a decrease in [(18)F]FLT PET but not [(18)F]FDG PET uptake correlated with cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. The reduction in [(18)F]FLT PET signal at day 2 translated into dramatic tumor shrinkage four days later. Furthermore, the specificity of our results is confirmed by the complete lack of [(18)F]FLT PET response of tumors expressing the T790M erlotinib resistance mutation of EGFR. [(18)F]FLT PET enables robust identification of erlotinib response in EGFR-dependent tumors at a very early stage. [(18)F]FLT PET imaging may represent an appropriate method for early prediction of response to EGFR TKI treatment in patients with NSCLC.
0 p53-Repressed miRNAs are involved with E2F in a feed-forward loop promoting proliferation. Normal cell growth is governed by a complicated biological system, featuring multiple levels of control, often deregulated in cancers. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the control of gene expression is now increasingly appreciated, yet their involvement in controlling cell proliferation is still not well understood. Here we investigated the mammalian cell proliferation control network consisting of transcriptional regulators, E2F and p53, their targets and a family of 15 miRNAs. Indicative of their significance, expression of these miRNAs is downregulated in senescent cells and in breast cancers harboring wild-type p53. These miRNAs are repressed by p53 in an E2F1-mediated manner. Furthermore, we show that these miRNAs silence antiproliferative genes, which themselves are E2F1 targets. Thus, miRNAs and transcriptional regulators appear to cooperate in the framework of a multi-gene transcriptional and post-transcriptional feed-forward loop. Finally, we show that, similarly to p53 inactivation, overexpression of representative miRNAs promotes proliferation and delays senescence, manifesting the detrimental phenotypic consequence of perturbations in this circuit. Taken together, these findings position miRNAs as novel key players in the mammalian cellular proliferation network.
0 Pediatric osteomyelitis and septic arthritis: the pathology of neonatal disease. The morphologic and histologic examination of over fifty-five foci of metaphyseal/epiphyseal osteomyelitis and eleven septic joints from five cases of neonatal osteomyelitis and joint sepsis are described in detail. The severity of the bone and joint involvement varied considerably, allowing a better understanding of the pathophysiologic sequence of events in the disease in the neonatal time period. Of particular importance were (1) the multifocal nature of the disease, (2) the highly variable destruction of the growth plate (physis) by several discrete mechanisms, and (3) the invasion of the chondroepiphysis through the cartilage canal systems. Two of the cases died from respiratory complications several months following presumed successful treatment of their skeletal infections. S&pecimens showed significant growth plate damage continuing beyond the neonatal period. These findings support the need for rapid diagnosis and drainage, whenever feasible, to prevent long-term skeletal growth damage. The severity of involvement also should emphasize that this disease, especially in the neonate, is not an innocuous condition, as a recent review suggested.
3 Viral hepatitis: problems of incidence and control in military personnel. (A) Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is now the major cause of infectious viral hepatitis in U.S. military personnel and probably also in the civilian population over 15 years of age. (B) The incidence of icteric, viral hepatitis is much higher in U.S. military personnel than in comparable age groups in the civilian population. The 17-to 20-year-old enlisted men show the highest rates. (C) In parts of the world (e.g., U.S.A., Germany) where most of the inapparent infection is caused by the adw subtype of HBV, most of the acute clinical disease is caused by the ayw subtype. In the U.S.A. and Germany, 95% or more of HB(s) Ag isolates from U.S. military personnel with acute hepatitis is ayw. (D) It may be many years before one can expect to have sufficient data for a decision as to the possible availability of an effective HBV vaccine. Accordingly, a decision is urgently needed regarding either the immediate use of the best practically available hepatitis immune gamma globulin, that can be prepared by modern techniques, for the prevention of hepatitis in U.S. military personnel or postponement of such use until an adequate and properly controlled trial can be carried out in active duty military personnel in an area of high incidence.
3 The early years of coeducation at the Yale University School of Medicine. The Yale School of Medicine began accepting women as candidates for the degree of medicine in the fall of 1916. This decision was consistent with the trend in medical education at the time. While Yale was not the first prestigious Eastern medical school to admit women, joining Johns Hopkins (1893) and the University of Pennsylvania (1914), it was not one of the last. Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons admitted women a year later, but Harvard Medical School held out until 1945. The years 1916--1920 saw the number of women enrolled in medical school almost double. Yale's decision to admit women seems to have been made with little resistance from the faculty. The final decision was made through the encouragement and financial help of Henry Farnam, a professor of economics at Yale, who agreed to pay for the women's bathrooms. His daughter, Louise, was in the first class of women. At graduation she was awarded the highest scholastic honors, the Campbell Gold Prize. From Yale she travelled to the Yale-sponsored medical school in Changsha, China, where she became the first female faculty member, a position she held for twelve years. The impressions of Ella Clay Wakeman Calhoun, the only woman to graduate in the second class of women, are presented here. Since 1916 the Yale School of Medicine has undergone extensive physical and philosophical changes, developments in which women have participated.
3 A fasting inducible switch modulates gluconeogenesis via activator/coactivator exchange. During early fasting, increases in skeletal muscle proteolysis liberate free amino acids for hepatic gluconeogenesis in response to pancreatic glucagon. Hepatic glucose output diminishes during the late protein-sparing phase of fasting, when ketone body production by the liver supplies compensatory fuel for glucose-dependent tissues. Glucagon stimulates the gluconeogenic program by triggering the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2; also known as TORC2), while parallel decreases in insulin signalling augment gluconeogenic gene expression through the dephosphorylation and nuclear shuttling of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). Here we show that a fasting-inducible switch, consisting of the histone acetyltransferase p300 and the nutrient-sensing deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), maintains energy balance in mice through the sequential induction of CRTC2 and FOXO1. After glucagon induction, CRTC2 stimulated gluconeogenic gene expression by an association with p300, which we show here is also activated by dephosphorylation at Ser 89 during fasting. In turn, p300 increased hepatic CRTC2 activity by acetylating it at Lys 628, a site that also targets CRTC2 for degradation after its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase constitutive photomorphogenic protein (COP1). Glucagon effects were attenuated during late fasting, when CRTC2 was downregulated owing to SIRT1-mediated deacetylation and when FOXO1 supported expression of the gluconeogenic program. Disrupting SIRT1 activity, by liver-specific knockout of the Sirt1 gene or by administration of a SIRT1 antagonist, increased CRTC2 activity and glucose output, whereas exposure to SIRT1 agonists reduced them. In view of the reciprocal activation of FOXO1 and its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha, encoded by Ppargc1a) by SIRT1 activators, our results illustrate how the exchange of two gluconeogenic regulators during fasting maintains energy balance.
0 The enteroviruses: recent advances. New information accrues periodically in the ledger accounting for infections and diseases associated with the human enteroviruses. The discoveries of "new" serotypes and how they affect people are subjects of continuing attention. Some other relevant information on "old" serotypes relates to variations in age-specific attack rates and associated morbidity and mortality for neonates and older infants. Among the morbidity reports are recounts during outbreaks of virus-positive cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs) that initially may not have cytological or biochemical abnormalities. Prolonged enterovirus infections may develop in persons having agammaglobulinemia. Lastly, some provocative associations concern the pathologic expressions of enteroviruses in the development and persistence of injury to the heart (myocardiopathies) and the pancreas (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus).
0 The prevalence of mental disorders among the homeless in western countries: systematic review and meta-regression analysis. There are well over a million homeless people in Western Europe and North America, but reliable estimates of the prevalence of major mental disorders among this population are lacking. We undertook a systematic review of surveys of such disorders in homeless people. We searched for surveys of the prevalence of psychotic illness, major depression, alcohol and drug dependence, and personality disorder that were based on interviews of samples of unselected homeless people. We searched bibliographic indexes, scanned reference lists, and corresponded with authors. We explored potential sources of any observed heterogeneity in the estimates by meta-regression analysis, including geographical region, sample size, and diagnostic method. Twenty-nine eligible surveys provided estimates obtained from 5,684 homeless individuals from seven countries. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in prevalence estimates for mental disorders among the studies (all Cochran's chi(2) significant at p < 0.001 and all I(2) > 85%). The most common mental disorders were alcohol dependence, which ranged from 8.1% to 58.5%, and drug dependence, which ranged from 4.5% to 54.2%. For psychotic illness, the prevalence ranged from 2.8% to 42.3%, with similar findings for major depression. The prevalence of alcohol dependence was found to have increased over recent decades. Homeless people in Western countries are substantially more likely to have alcohol and drug dependence than the age-matched general population in those countries, and the prevalences of psychotic illnesses and personality disorders are higher. Models of psychiatric and social care that can best meet these mental health needs requires further investigation.
3 Clinical review: balancing the therapeutic, safety, and economic issues underlying effective antipseudomonal carbapenem use. Antipseudomonal carbapenems have played a useful role in our antimicrobial armamentarium for 20 years. However, a review of their use during that period creates concern that their clinical effectiveness is critically dependent on attainment of an appropriate dosing range. Unfortunately, adequate carbapenem dosing is missed for many reasons, including benefit/risk misconceptions, a narrow therapeutic window for imipenem and meropenem (due to an increased rate of seizures at higher doses), increasingly resistant pathogens requiring higher doses than are typically given, and cost containment issues that may limit their use. To improve the use of carbapenems, several initiatives should be considered: increase awareness about appropriate treatment with carbapenems across hospital departments; determine optimal dosing regimens for settings where multidrug resistant organisms are more likely encountered; use of, or combination with, an alternative antimicrobial agent having more favorable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, or adverse event profile; and administer a newer carbapenem with lower propensity for resistance development (for example, reduced expression of efflux pumps or greater stability against carbapenemases).
3 Cancer induction by restriction of oncogene expression to the stem cell compartment. In human cancers, all cancerous cells carry the oncogenic genetic lesions. However, to elucidate whether cancer is a stem cell-driven tissue, we have developed a strategy to limit oncogene expression to the stem cell compartment in a transgenic mouse setting. Here, we focus on the effects of the BCR-ABLp210 oncogene, associated with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in humans. We show that CML phenotype and biology can be established in mice by restricting BCR-ABLp210 expression to stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1)(+) cells. The course of the disease in Sca1-BCR-ABLp210 mice was not modified on STI571 treatment. However, BCR-ABLp210-induced CML is reversible through the unique elimination of the cancer stem cells (CSCs). Overall, our data show that oncogene expression in Sca1(+) cells is all that is required to fully reprogramme it, giving rise to a full-blown, oncogene-specified tumour with all its mature cellular diversity, and that elimination of the CSCs is enough to eradicate the whole tumour.
0 Viral hepatitis in the Air Force. The reported incidence of viral hepatitis in the Air Force has increased over the past 10 years. The total number of days lost from duty has declined as has the average number of days lost per case. Distribution of USAF reported cases has been roughly equally divided among the three diagnostic categories, in contrast to the total United States reported distribution. Relatively few USAF cases have had a documented history of drug abuse since we began collecting this information, and the proportion of these cases has steadily declined. Finally, these diseases still represent significant economic and operational costs to the Air Force so that prevention and control remain important items of concern to commanders and the medical service.
0 Interplay of factors leading to adverse drug reactions in the liver, a personal viewpoint. Adverse drug reactions in liver involve formation of a reactive metabolic intermediary of the drug, binding of the intermediary to macromolecules in the cell, notably proteins in the plasma membrane, immunological response to these altered proteins and attack against hepatocytes bearing these altered proteins by immune mechanisms. At each step in this complex process many factors act to enhance or depress drug metabolism, metabolite disposition, macromolecular binding, neoantigen formation, and the cell mediated and humoral immune attack. The extent and direction of each step may be dose dependent but the complexity of the overall mechanism is so immense that predictability of hepatic drug reactions is unlikely in most instances.
3 Are perceived neighbourhood problems associated with the likelihood of smoking? To explore associations between residents' perceptions of the local residential environment and the likelihood of their smoking. Using data (n = 2615) from the West of Scotland Twenty-07 Study, separately by gender, cross-sectional associations between respondents' perceptions of neighbourhood (perceived absence of goods, incivilities and physical environmental problems) and the likelihood of being a current smoker and the amount smoked were examined. Perceived neighbourhood problems are associated with the likelihood of smoking but mainly among those with the most negative view of the local neighbourhood. Perceptions of the provision of neighbourhood amenities seems to be more strongly associated with women's than men's smoking status, whereas the perceived quality of the local neighbourhood appears to be a better predictor of men's smoking. Efforts to reduce smoking levels among more deprived groups may need to pay more attention to the role of local environmental conditions in influencing smoking behaviour.
0 Looking for myself: current multisensory input alters self-face recognition. How do I know the person I see in the mirror is really me? Is it because I know the person simply looks like me, or is it because the mirror reflection moves when I move, and I see it being touched when I feel touch myself? Studies of face-recognition suggest that visual recognition of stored visual features inform self-face recognition. In contrast, body-recognition studies conclude that multisensory integration is the main cue to selfhood. The present study investigates for the first time the specific contribution of current multisensory input for self-face recognition. Participants were stroked on their face while they were looking at a morphed face being touched in synchrony or asynchrony. Before and after the visuo-tactile stimulation participants performed a self-recognition task. The results show that multisensory signals have a significant effect on self-face recognition. Synchronous tactile stimulation while watching another person's face being similarly touched produced a bias in recognizing one's own face, in the direction of the other person included in the representation of one's own face. Multisensory integration can update cognitive representations of one's body, such as the sense of ownership. The present study extends this converging evidence by showing that the correlation of synchronous multisensory signals also updates the representation of one's face. The face is a key feature of our identity, but at the same time is a source of rich multisensory experiences used to maintain or update self-representations.
1 Correction: PAIS: paracetamol (acetaminophen) in stroke; protocol for a randomized, double blind clinical trial. [ISCRTN74418480]. The Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) In Stroke (PAIS) study is a phase III multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of high-dose acetaminophen in patients with acute stroke. The trial compares treatment with a daily dose of 6 g acetaminophen, started within 12 hours after the onset of symptoms, with matched placebo. The purpose of this study is to assess whether treatment with acetaminophen for 3 days will result in improved functional outcome through a modest reduction in body temperature and prevention of fever.The previously planned statistical analysis based on a dichotomization of the scores on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) may not make the most efficient use of the available baseline information. Therefore, the planned primary analysis of the PAIS study has been changed from fixed dichotomization of the mRS to a sliding dichotomy analysis. Instead of taking a single definition of good outcome for all patients, the definition is tailored to each individual patient's baseline prognosis on entry into the trial. The protocol change was initiated because of both advances in statistical approaches and to increase the efficiency of the trial by improving statistical power. Current Controlled Trials [ISCRTN74418480].
3 Myocardial hypertrophy overrides the angiogenic response to hypoxia. Cyanosis and myocardial hypertrophy frequently occur in combination. Hypoxia or cyanosis can be potent inducers of angiogenesis, regulating the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), and VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and 2); in contrast, pressure overload hypertrophy is often associated with impaired pro-angiogenic signaling and decreased myocardial capillary density. We hypothesized that the physiological pro-angiogenic response to cyanosis in the hypertrophied myocardium is blunted through differential HIF and VEGF-associated signaling. Newborn rabbits underwent aortic banding and, together with sham-operated littermates, were transferred into a hypoxic chamber (FiO(2) = 0.12) at 3 weeks of age. Control banded or sham-operated rabbits were housed in normoxia. Systemic cyanosis was confirmed (hematocrit, arterial oxygen saturation, and serum erythropoietin). Myocardial tissue was assayed for low oxygen concentrations using a pimonidazole adduct. At 4 weeks of age, HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha protein levels, HIF-1alpha DNA-binding activity, and expression of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGF were determined in hypoxic and normoxic rabbits. At 6 weeks of age, left-ventricular capillary density was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Under normoxia, capillary density was decreased in the banded rabbits compared to non-banded littermates. As expected, non-hypertrophied hearts responded to hypoxia with increased capillary density; however, banded hypoxic rabbits demonstrated no increase in angiogenesis. This blunted pro-angiogenic response to hypoxia in the hypertrophied myocardium was associated with lower HIF-2alpha and VEGFR-2 levels and increased HIF-1alpha activity and VEGFR-1 expression. In contrast, non-hypertrophied hearts responded to hypoxia with increased HIF-2alpha and VEGFR-2 expression with lower VEGFR-1 expression. The participation of HIF-2alpha and VEGFR-2 appear to be required for hypoxia-stimulated myocardial angiogenesis. In infant rabbit hearts with pressure overload hypertrophy, this pro-angiogenic response to hypoxia is effectively uncoupled, apparently in part due to altered HIF-mediated signaling and VEGFR subtype expression.
1 Rapid diagnostic methods for influenza virus in clinical specimens: a comparative study. A comparison of five rapid viral diagnostic techniques for identifying influenza virus in nasopharyngeal aspirates has been made on patients with influenza-like illnesses. Initial results with immune electron microscopy were positive in only one of 11 specimens from which virus was isolated and further work abandoned. Four other rapid tests were carried out on 39 specimens from which influenza virus had been isolated in tissue culture in 28. Of these 28 specimens yielding virus, 24 (85.7 percent) were positive by an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) on nasopharyngeal cells; 18 (64.3 percent) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 19 (67.8 percent) by enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA), and 26 (92.8 percent) by a rapid tissue culture amplification method (TCA) in a continuous Rhesus monkey kidney line (LLC-MK2) with identification of virus by fluorescent antibody. In terms of sensitivity, simplicity, and rapidity, a combination of the IFAT and TCA methods seems to be very useful.
1 Severe Streptococcus pyogenes infections, United Kingdom, 2003-2004. As part of a Europe-wide initiative to explore current epidemiologic patterns of severe disease caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, the United Kingdom undertook enhanced population-based surveillance during 2003-2004. A total of 3,775 confirmed cases of severe S. pyogenes infection were identified over 2 years, 3.33/100,000 population, substantially more than previously estimated. Skin/soft tissue infections were the most common manifestation (42%), followed by respiratory tract infections (17%). Injection drug use was identified as a risk factor for 20% of case-patients. One in 5 infected case-patients died within 7 days of diagnosis; the highest mortality rate was for cases of necrotizing fasciitis (34%). Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, alcoholism, young age, and infection with emm/M3 types were independently associated with increased risk for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Understanding the pattern of these diseases and predictors of poor patient outcome will help with identification and assessment of the potential effect of targeted interventions.
1 Repetitive architecture of the Haemophilus influenzae Hia trimeric autotransporter. The Hia autotransporter of Haemophilus influenzae belongs to the trimeric autotransporter subfamily and mediates bacterial adherence to the respiratory epithelium. In this report, we show that the structure of Hia is characterized by a modular architecture containing repeats of structurally distinct domains. Comparison of the structures of HiaBD1 and HiaBD2 adhesive repeats and a nonadhesive repeat (a novel fold) shed light on the structural determinants of Hia adhesive function. Examination of the structure of an extended version of the Hia translocator domain revealed the structural transition between the C-terminal translocator domain and the N-terminal passenger domain, highlighting a highly intertwined domain that is ubiquitous among trimeric autotransporters. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanism of Hia adhesive activity and the overall structure of trimeric autotransporters.
1 Alternatives to project-specific consent for access to personal information for health research: insights from a public dialogue. The role of consent for research use of health information is contentious. Most discussion has focused on when project-specific consent may be waived but, recently, a broader range of consent options has been entertained, including broad opt-in for multiple studies with restrictions and notification with opt-out. We sought to elicit public values in this matter and to work toward an agreement about a common approach to consent for use of personal information for health research through deliberative public dialogues. We conducted seven day-long public dialogues, involving 98 participants across Canada. Immediately before and after each dialogue, participants completed a fixed-response questionnaire rating individuals' support for 3 approaches to consent in the abstract and their consent choices for 5 health research scenarios using personal information. They also rated how confident different safeguards made them feel that their information was being used responsibly. Broad opt-in consent for use of personal information garnered the greatest support in the abstract. When presented with specific research scenarios, no one approach to consent predominated. When profit was introduced into the scenarios, consent choices shifted toward greater control over use. Despite lively and constructive dialogues, and considerable shifting in opinion at the individual level, at the end of the day, there was no substantive aggregate movement in opinion. Personal controls were among the most commonly cited approaches to improving people's confidence in the responsible use of their information for research. Because no one approach to consent satisfied even a simple majority of dialogue participants and the importance placed on personal controls, a mechanism should be developed for documenting consent choice for different types of research, including ways for individuals to check who has accessed their medical record for purposes other than clinical care. This could be done, for example, through a web-based patient portal to their electronic health record. Researchers and policy makers should continue to engage the public to promote greater public understanding of the research process and to look for feasible alternatives to existing approaches to project-specific consent for observational research.
2 Year in review 2007: Critical Care--respirology. All original research contributions published in Critical Care in 2007 in the field of respirology and critical care medicine are summarized in this article. Fifteen papers were grouped in the following categories: acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, ventilator-induced lung injury, imaging, and other topics.
0 Deciphering the ligand-binding sites in the Borrelia burgdorferi complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 2 required for interactions with the human immune regulators factor H and factor H-like protein 1. Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, employs sophisticated means to evade killing by its mammalian hosts. One important immune escape mechanism is the inhibition of complement activation mediated by interactions of the host-derived immune regulators factor H (CFH) and factor H-like protein 1 (CFHL1) with borrelial complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (BbCRASPs). BbCRASP-2 is a distinctive CFH- and CFHL1-binding protein that is produced by serum-resistant B. burgdorferi strains. Here we show that binding of CFH by BbCRASP-2 is due to electrostatic as well as hydrophobic forces. In addition, 14 individual amino acid residues of BbCRASP-2 were identified as being involved in CFH and CFHL1 binding. Alanine substitutions of most of those residues significantly inhibited binding of CFH and/or CFHL1 by recombinant BbCRASP-2 proteins. To conclusively define the effects of BbCRASP-2 residue substitutions on serum sensitivity in the bacterial context, a serum-sensitive Borrelia garinii strain was transformed with plasmids that directed production of either wild-type or mutated BbCRASP-2 proteins. Critical amino acid residues within BbCRASP-2 were identified, with bacteria producing distinct mutant proteins being unable to bind either CFH or CFHL1, showing high levels of complement components C3, C6, and C5b-9 deposited on their surfaces and being highly sensitive to killing by normal serum. Collectively, we mapped a structurally sensitive CFH/CFHL1 binding site within borrelial BbCRASP-2 and identified single amino acid residues potentially involved in the interaction with both complement regulators.
0 The vertebrate urinary bladder: osmoregulatory and other uses. The bladder may serve more biological uses than simple storage. The importance of bladder functions can be inferred from its presence among vertebrates, its anatomy and histology. From an evolutionary perspective, bladders have evolved at least twice in the vertebrates. The variability of permeability of the urinary bladder to water and solutes among species is discussed. Finally, the urinary bladder may play an osmoregulatory role.
3 The influence of postural changes on the glomerular filtration rate in nephroptosis. The influence of postural changes on renal function was determined in 13 patients with nephroptosis and in 5 normal subjects by measuring GFR in the erect and supine positions. The results indicate that GFR was reduced in the erect position in 10 of 13 patients with either unilateral or bilateral nephroptosis whereas GFR was increased in the erect position in 4 of 5 patients without renal disease. One patient with bilateral nephroptosis and renovascular hypertension was studied before and after surgical correction of his disease. These observations indicate that patients with nephroptosis may have significant reductions in renal function when they assume an upright position, and suggest that GFR measurements in the supine and erect position in patients with nephroptosis can be helpful in evaluating this disease.
0 Targeting histone deacetylase activity in rheumatoid arthritis and asthma as prototypes of inflammatory disease: should we keep our HATs on? Cellular activation, proliferation and survival in chronic inflammatory diseases is regulated not only by engagement of signal trans-duction pathways that modulate transcription factors required for these processes, but also by epigenetic regulation of transcription factor access to gene promoter regions. Histone acetyl transferases coordinate the recruitment and activation of transcription factors with conformational changes in histones that allow gene promoter exposure. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) counteract histone acetyl transferase activity through the targeting of both histones as well as nonhistone signal transduction proteins important in inflammation. Numerous studies have indicated that depressed HDAC activity in patients with inflammatory airway diseases may contribute to local proinflammatory cytokine production and diminish patient responses to corticosteroid treatment. Recent observations that HDAC activity is depressed in rheumatoid arthritis patient synovial tissue have predicted that strategies restoring HDAC function may be therapeutic in this disease as well. Pharmacological inhibitors of HDAC activity, however, have demonstrated potent therapeutic effects in animal models of arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. In the present review we assess and reconcile these outwardly paradoxical study results to provide a working model for how alterations in HDAC activity may contribute to pathology in rheumatoid arthritis, and highlight key questions to be answered in the preclinical evaluation of compounds modulating these enzymes.
3 Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is a disease of worldwide distribution which occurs in endemic and epidemic form and is transmitted primarily by person-to-person contact through the fecal-oral route. Common source epidemics due to contamination of food are relatively common, and water-borne epidemics have been described less frequently. The presumed etiologic agent of hepatitis A has now been visualized by immune electron microscopic (IEM) techniques in early acute-illness-phase stools of humans with hepatitis A as well as in chimpanzees experimentally infected with material known to contain hepatitis A virus. In addition, several new serologic tests for the detection of antibody against hepatitis A virus have been described. These include complement fixation and immune adherence techniques. Current data suggest that hepatitis A is caused by a single viral agent lacking the morphologic heterogeneity of hepatitis B viral components and that there may be relative antigenic homogeneity between strains of virus recovered from various parts of the world. Serologic studies to date also indicate that hepatitis A virus is not a major contributing cause in post-transfusion hepatitis.
1 Temporal changes in sequential quantitative thallium-201 imaging following myocardial infarction in dogs: comparison of four- and twenty-four-hour infarct images. Thallium-201 ((201)T1) myocardial perfusion imaging allows definition of zones of myocardial infarction and ischemia. The temporal changes in sequential quantitative (201)T1 infarct imaging was studied 4 and 24 hours in dogs subjected to closed-chest anterior wall myocardial infarction. A temporal decrease in (201)T1 imaged infarct areas was noted in 10 of 13 animals. In no animal did the infarct area increase. The imaged infarct area decreased by an average of 30% from 12.9 ± 6.2 cm(2) at 4 hours to 9.1 ± 5.1 cm(2) at 24 hours (p < 0.001), and involved 34 ± 16% of the total (201)T1 left ventricular distribution at 4 hours and 22 ± 14% at 24 hours (p < 0.001). The magnitude of temporal change in imaged infarct area was not predicted by initial image defect or final histopathologic infarct size. Thus, the results of (201)T1 infarct imaging in the early period of infarction are clearly dependent upon the time at which the procedure is performed.
0 Direct inhibition of GSK3beta by the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of LRP6 in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays a central role in development and is also involved in a diverse array of diseases. Binding of Wnts to the coreceptors Frizzled and LRP6/5 leads to phosphorylation of PPPSPxS motifs in the LRP6/5 intracellular region and the inhibition of GSK3beta bound to the scaffold protein Axin. However, it remains unknown how GSK3beta is specifically inhibited upon Wnt stimulation. Here, we show that overexpression of the intracellular region of LRP6 containing a Ser/Thr rich cluster and a PPPSPxS motif impairs the activity of GSK3beta in cells. Synthetic peptides containing the PPPSPxS motif strongly inhibit GSK3beta in vitro only when they are phosphorylated. Microinjection of these peptides into Xenopus embryos confirms that the phosphorylated PPPSPxS motif potentiates Wnt-induced second body axis formation. In addition, we show that the Ser/Thr rich cluster of LRP6 plays an important role in LRP6 binding to GSK3beta. These observations demonstrate that phosphorylated LRP6/5 both recruits and directly inhibits GSK3beta using two distinct portions of its cytoplasmic sequence, and suggest a novel mechanism of activation in this signaling pathway.
0 Recently published papers: Pseudomonas, brain and bowel injury and novel cardiac therapies. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a familiar foe in intensive care units, but those associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa have a particularly adverse impact on outcome. Correct antibiotic therapy and a novel endotracheal tube may reduce this burden. Does activated protein C improve outcome from acute lung injury and what is the role played by hyperventilation therapy in traumatic brain injury? Recent research has attempted to answer these questions. Further novel approaches have been evaluated in the management of ischaemic heart disease, and more light has been shed on acute bowel injury.
3 A micropuncture study of HCO3 reabsorption by the hypertrophied proximal tubule. In rats with renal failure produced by excision of one kidney and infarction of large portions of the other kidney, given a low calcium, high phosphorus diet for 2-3 weeks, GFR was reduced by 80 percent, the fractional excretion of sodium increased from 7 to 23 percent, that of bicarbonate from 16 to 23 percent and that of water from 4 to 13 percent. Single nephron GFR in the remaining nephrons was nearly doubled and end-proximal TF/P(In) was depressed from 2.3 to 1.8, and proximal TF/P(HCO3) from 0.52 to 0.35, the latter figure corresponding to an increase of absolute proximal HCO(3) reabsorption from 1.7 to 3.5 nEq/min or from 2.8 to 3.2 Eq/L of single nephron glomerular filtrate. Acute parathyroidectomy had no influence on the fall of GFR or the rise of SNGFR in the remaining nephrons and failed to cause any significant changes in proximal tubular bicarbonate reabsorption. Parathyroidectomy, on the other hand, practically prevented the rise of the fractional excretion of sodium and of water and inverted the rise of the fractional excretion of bicarbonate to a fall. The data are interpreted to indicate that secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure impairs distal nephron bicarbonate and sodium reabsorption and, thus, contributes to the maintenance of sodium balance, but could possibly aggravate acidosis.
1 The population genetics of dN/dS. Evolutionary pressures on proteins are often quantified by the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites. The dN/dS ratio was originally developed for application to distantly diverged sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. Nevertheless, the dN/dS measure is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent segregating polymorphisms. Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population under selection, and we find that in this context, dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS>1, is violated within a population. For population samples, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples.
1 Population physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling for the human lactational transfer of PCB-153 with consideration of worldwide human biomonitoring results. One of the most serious human health concerns related to environmental contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is the presence of these chemicals in breast milk. We developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of PCB-153 in women, and predict its transfer via lactation to infants. The model is the first human, population-scale lactational model for PCB-153. Data in the literature provided estimates for model development and for performance assessment. We used physiologic parameters from a cohort in Taiwan and reference values given in the literature to estimate partition coefficients based on chemical structure and the lipid content in various body tissues. Using exposure data from Japan, we predicted acquired body burden of PCB-153 at an average childbearing age of 25 years and compared predictions to measurements from studies in multiple countries. We attempted one example of reverse dosimetry modeling using our PBPK model for possible exposure scenarios in Canadian Inuits, the population with the highest breast milk PCB-153 level in the world. Forward-model predictions agree well with human biomonitoring measurements, as represented by summary statistics and uncertainty estimates. The model successfully describes the range of possible PCB-153 dispositions in maternal milk, suggesting a promising option for back-estimating doses for various populations.
0 Lions and prions and deer demise. Contagious prion diseases--scrapie of sheep and chronic wasting disease of several species in the deer family--give rise to epidemics that seem capable of compromising host population viability. Despite this prospect, the ecological consequences of prion disease epidemics in natural populations have received little consideration. Using a cohort study design, we found that prion infection dramatically lowered survival of free-ranging adult (>2-year-old) mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus): estimated average life expectancy was 5.2 additional years for uninfected deer but only 1.6 additional years for infected deer. Prion infection also increased nearly fourfold the rate of mountain lions (Puma concolor) preying on deer, suggesting that epidemics may alter predator-prey dynamics by facilitating hunting success. Despite selective predation, about one fourth of the adult deer we sampled were infected. High prevalence and low survival of infected deer provided a plausible explanation for the marked decline in this deer population since the 1980s. Remarkably high infection rates sustained in the face of intense predation show that even seemingly complete ecosystems may offer little resistance to the spread and persistence of contagious prion diseases. Moreover, the depression of infected populations may lead to local imbalances in food webs and nutrient cycling in ecosystems in which deer are important herbivores.
3 Increased production of endogenous pyrogen and lysozyme by blood monocytes in sarcoidosis. Blood monocytes from patients with sarcoidosis were incubated in vitro, and secretion of endogenous pyrogen (EP), the protein which mediates fever, and lysozyme (L) were measured. After incubation with endotoxin, monocytes from 5 patients with sarcoidosis released twice as much EP as did monocytes from normal individuals (p < .001). Initial 24-hr secretion of L by monocytes from 6 of 11 additional patients with sarcoidosis exceeded the normal range of values for cells from 11 age- and sex-matched control individuals. Cells with initially augmented secretion rates continued to secrete increased amounts of L for 3 days. A correlation was noted between in vitro secretion of L by monocytes and serum levels of L in the same patient. These studies indicate that circulating mononuclear cells in some patients with sarcoidosis have an increased capacity to secrete EP and/or L prior to tissue localization.
1 A quality assessment of genetic association studies supporting susceptibility and outcome in acute lung injury. Clinical observations and animal models provide evidence that the development of acute lung injury (ALI), a phenomenon of acute diffuse lung inflammation in critically ill patients, is influenced by genetic factors. Association studies are the main tool for exploring common genetic variations underlying ALI susceptibility and/or outcome. We aimed to assess the quality of positive genetic association studies with ALI susceptibility and/or outcome in adults in order to highlight their consistency and major limitations. We conducted a broad PubMed literature search from 1996 to June 2008 for original articles in English supporting a positive association (P < or = 0.05) of genetic variants contributing to all-cause ALI susceptibility and/or outcome. Studies were evaluated based on current recommendations using a 10-point quality scoring system derived from 14 criteria, and the gene was considered as the unit of replication. Genes were also categorized according to biological processes using the Gene Ontology. Our search identified a total of 29 studies reporting positive findings for 16 genes involved mainly in the response to external stimulus and cell signal transduction. The genes encoding for interleukin-6, mannose-binding lectin, surfactant protein B, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were the most replicated across the studies. On average, the studies had an intermediate quality score (median of 4.62 and interquartile range of 3.33 to 6.15). Although the quality of association studies seems to have improved over the years, more and better designed studies, including the replication of previous findings, with larger sample sizes extended to population groups other than those of European descent, are needed for identifying firm genetic modifiers of ALI.
0 Transient warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and cryoglobulinemia associated with seminoma. A patient with a pure seminoma presented with severe IgG-mediated warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Monoclonal IgM-kappa cryoglobulinemia and a biological false positive test for syphilis were also found. Treatment directed at both the seminoma and the hemolysis resulted in the complete disappearance of these antibodies. It is possible that these immunological phenomena occurred in response to the tumor. The occurrence of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and monoclonal paraproteinemia in association with solid tumors is reviewed.
2 Chronic exposure to ambient ozone and asthma hospital admissions among children. The association between chronic exposure to air pollution and adverse health outcomes has not been well studied. This project investigated the impact of chronic exposure to high ozone levels on childhood asthma admissions in New York State. We followed a birth cohort born in New York State during 1995-1999 to first asthma admission or until 31 December 2000. We identified births and asthma admissions through the New York State Integrated Child Health Information System and linked these data with ambient ozone data (8-hr maximum) from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. We defined chronic ozone exposure using three indicators: mean concentration during the follow-up period, mean concentration during the ozone season, and proportion of follow-up days with ozone levels > 70 ppb. We performed logistic regression analysis to adjust for child's age, sex, birth weight, and gestational age; maternal race/ethnicity, age, education, insurance status, smoking during pregnancy, and poverty level; and geographic region, temperature, and co-pollutants. Asthma admissions were significantly associated with increased ozone levels for all chronic exposure indicators (odds ratios, 1.16-1.68), with a positive dose-response relationship. We found stronger associations among younger children, low sociodemographic groups, and New York City residents as effect modifiers. Chronic exposure to ambient ozone may increase the risk of asthma admissions among children. Younger children and those in low socioeconomic groups have a greater risk of asthma than do other children at the same ozone level.
0 Global distribution of novel rhinovirus genotype. Global surveillance for a novel rhinovirus genotype indicated its association with community outbreaks and pediatric respiratory disease in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Molecular dating indicates that these viruses have been circulating for at least 250 years.
0 Pyrvinium targets the unfolded protein response to hypoglycemia and its anti-tumor activity is enhanced by combination therapy. We identified pyrvinium pamoate, an old anthelminthic medicine, which preferentially inhibits anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells over anchorage-dependent growth (approximately 10 fold). It was also reported by others to have anti-tumor activity in vivo and selective toxicity against cancer cells under glucose starvation in vitro, but with unknown mechanism. Here, we provide evidence that pyrvinium suppresses the transcriptional activation of GRP78 and GRP94 induced by glucose deprivation or 2-deoxyglucose (2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor), but not by tunicamycin or A23187. Other UPR pathways induced by glucose starvation, e.g. XBP-1, ATF4, were also found suppressed by pyrvinium. Constitutive expression of GRP78 via transgene partially protected cells from pyrvinium induced cell death under glucose starvation, suggesting that suppression of the UPR is involved in pyrvinium mediated cytotoxicity under glucose starvation. Xenograft experiments showed rather marginal overall anti-tumor activity for pyrvinium as a monotherapy. However, the combination of pyrvinium and Doxorubicin demonstrated significantly enhanced efficacy in vivo, supporting a mechanistic treatment concept based on tumor hypoglycemia and UPR.
0 Cytomegalovirus replication and the host immune response. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is closely associated with host cellular structures, and this has a significant impact upon the immunologic response following infection. CMV may be recovered from a variety of body secretions and fluids during acute infection, and protracted shedding may supervene in some instances. The reasons for a variable host response to CMV infection remain unclear, and the mechanisms responsible for the establishment of persistence have not been worked out. CMV persistence and latency are discussed, and some recently derived relevant data are presented. An animal model has been developed consistent with clinical observations pertaining to CMV transmission with blood. Results obtained in the course of these and other studies support the concept of immunological activation of latent CMV. The timing of CMV infection relative to an unrelated antigenic challenge is probably critical in determining the emergence of immunodepression or enhancement. Some aspects of CMV sero-diagnosis are also reviewed.
2 Serologic studies of acute respiratory infections in military personnel. The advantages, disadvantages, and uses of serological epidemiology are discussed in relation to acute respiratory infections in military personnel. The prevalence of antibody reflects both current and past experience with respiratory agents and is a measure of susceptinility. Incidence data calculated by testing two serial serum samples, on entry and discharge from the service, has indicated high influenza and mycoplasma pneumoniae rates in South American recruits and low rates of adenovirus and parainfluenza infections. Serologic analysis of reinfection rates showed high protection against influenza infections at HI antibody levels of over 1:40, against adenovirus infections at neutralizing titers of 1:5, and against M. pneumoniae infections at TRI antibody levels over 1:8. Antibody responses persisting at least 7 mo following immunization were demonstrated in 70% of 428 vaccinated young adults for A2 antigen and 20% for influenza B antigen. No relation of ABO blood groups to respiratory infection was found. The lack of myxovirus infections in four Polaris submarines is presented.
0 The signature of long-standing balancing selection at the human defensin beta-1 promoter. Defensins, small endogenous peptides with antimicrobial activity, are pivotal components of the innate immune response. A large cluster of defensin genes is located on human chromosome 8p; among them the beta defensin 1 (DEFB1) promoterhas been extensively studied since discovery that specific polymorphisms and haplotypes associate with asthma and atopy, susceptibility to severe sepsis, as well as HIV and Candida infection predisposition. Here, we characterize the sequence variation and haplotype structure of the DEFB1 promoter region in six human populations. In all of them, we observed high levels of nucleotide variation, an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles, reduced population differentiation and a genealogy with common haplotypes separated by deep branches. Indeed, a significant departure from the expectation of evolutionary neutrality was observed in all populations and the possibility that this is due to demographic history alone was ruled out. Also, we verified that the selection signature is restricted to the promoter region and not due to a linked balanced polymorphism. A phylogeny-based estimation indicated that the two major haplotype clades separated around 4.5 million years ago, approximately the time when the human and chimpanzee lineages split. Altogether, these features represent strong molecular signatures of long-term balancing selection, a process that is thought to be extremely rare outside major histocompatibility complex genes. Our data indicate that the DEFB1 promoter region carries functional variants and support previous hypotheses whereby alleles predisposing to atopic disorders are widespread in modern societies because they conferred resistance to pathogens in ancient settings.
2 Year in review 2007: Critical Care--multiple organ failure and sepsis. Several research papers published in Critical Care throughout 2007 examined the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of sepsis and multiorgan failure. The present review summarizes the findings and implications of the papers published on sepsis and multiorgan failure and places the research in the context of other work in the field.
1 Pro/con debate: is the scoop and run approach the best approach to trauma services organization? You are asked to be involved in organizing a trauma service for a major urban center. You are asked to make a decision on whether the services general approach to trauma in the city (which does have a well-established trauma center) will be scoop and run (minimal resuscitation at the scene with a goal to getting the patient to a trauma center as quickly as possible) or on-the-scene resuscitation with transfer following some degree of stabilization.
3 Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene and malondialdehyde in male workers in Chinese restaurants. To assess internal dose and oxidative stress in male restaurant workers exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from cooking oil fumes (COFs) in Chinese restaurants. The study participants included 288 male restaurant workers (171 kitchen and 117 service staff) in Chinese restaurants in Taiwan. Airborne particulate PAHs were measured over 12 h on each of two consecutive work days and then identified using high performance liquid chromatography. Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) measurements were used to indicate COF exposure, and urinary malondialdehyde (MDA) was adopted as an oxidative stress marker. Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationship between MDA and 1-OHP levels after adjusting for key personal covariates. Summed particulate PAH levels in kitchens (median 23.9 ng/m(3)) were significantly higher than those in dining areas (median 4.9 ng/m(3)). For non-smoking kitchen staff, mean MDA and 1-OHP levels were 344.2 (SD 243.7) and 6.0 (SD 8.0) mumol/mol creatinine, respectively. These levels were significantly higher than those for non-smoking service staff, which were 244.2 (SD 164.4) and 2.4 (SD 4.3) mumol/mol creatinine, respectively. Urinary 1-OHP levels were significantly associated with work in kitchens (p<0.05). Furthermore, urinary MDA levels were significantly associated with urinary 1-OHP levels (p<0.001) and working hours per day (p<0.05). These findings indicate that urinary 1-OHP and MDA levels reflect occupational exposure to PAHs from COFs and oxidative stress in workers in Chinese restaurants.
3 The paracellular pathway and bile formation. Choleretic infusions of taurocholate (40 μ moles for one hour) result in a significant increase in the number of lateral cell surface invaginations observed by scanning electron microscopy adjacent to the junctional complex of bile canaliculi in rat liver. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that these invaginations resemble "blisters" induced by osmotic gradients across epithelial tissues, a morphologic change which correlates with increases in ionic and hydraulic conductivity of the paracellular "shunt" pathway in such tissue. Since taurocholate infusions result in localization of ionic lanthanum chloride within hepatocyte junctional complexes, bile acids may also stimulate the movement of fluid and electrolytes across paracellular pathways during the process of bile formation.
3 The shark rectal gland: a model for the active transport of chloride. The rectal gland of the spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias, provides an easily studied model of active chloride transport powered indirectly by Na-K-ATPase. Co-transport of sodium with chloride can be demonstrated in membrane vesicles isolated from basolateral membranes of the gland. Chloride secretion is under the hormonal control of vasoactive intestinal peptide, and possibly other agents, via adenyl cyclase and cyclic AMP. A similar mechanism is probably responsible for the active transport of chloride across other biological membranes.
3 Multiple doses of erythropoietin impair liver regeneration by increasing TNF-alpha, the Bax to Bcl-xL ratio and apoptotic cell death. Liver resection and the use of small-for-size grafts are restricted by the necessity to provide a sufficient amount of functional liver mass. Only few promising strategies to maximize liver regeneration are available. Apart from its erythropoiesis-stimulating effect, erythropoietin (EPO) has meanwhile been recognized as mitogenic, tissue-protective, and anti-apoptotic pleiotropic cytokine. Thus, EPO may support regeneration of hepatic tissue. Rats undergoing 68% hepatectomy received daily either high dose (5000 IU/kg bw i.v.) or low dose (500 IU/kg bw i.v.) recombinant human EPO or equal amounts of physiologic saline. Parameters of liver regeneration and hepatocellular apoptosis were assessed at 24 h, 48 h and 5 d after resection. In addition, red blood cell count, hematocrit and serum EPO levels as well as plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were evaluated. Further, hepatic Bcl-x(L) and Bax protein expression were analyzed by Western blot. Administration of EPO significantly reduced the expression of PCNA at 24 h followed by a significant decrease in restitution of liver mass at day 5 after partial hepatectomy. EPO increased TNF-alpha levels and shifted the Bcl-x(L) to Bax ratio towards the pro-apoptotic Bax resulting in significantly increased hepatocellular apoptosis. Multiple doses of EPO after partial hepatectomy increase hepatocellular apoptosis and impair liver regeneration in rats. Thus, careful consideration should be made in pre- and post-operative recombinant human EPO administration in the setting of liver resection and transplantation.
1 Birds of a feather flock together: experience-driven formation of visual object categories in human ventral temporal cortex. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study provides direct evidence on visual object-category formation in the human brain. Although brain imaging has demonstrated object-category specific representations in the occipitotemporal cortex, the crucial question of how the brain acquires this knowledge has remained unresolved. We designed a stimulus set consisting of six highly similar bird types that can hardly be distinguished without training. All bird types were morphed with one another to create different exemplars of each category. After visual training, fMRI showed that responses in the right fusiform gyrus were larger for bird types for which a discrete category-boundary was established as compared with not-trained bird types. Importantly, compared with not-trained bird types, right fusiform responses were smaller for visually similar birds to which subjects were exposed during training but for which no category-boundary was learned. These data provide evidence for experience-induced shaping of occipitotemporal responses that are involved in category learning in the human brain.
3 Identification of residual blood proteins in ticks by mass spectrometry proteomics. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics of individual ticks demonstrated persistence of mammalian host blood components, including alpha- and beta-globin chains, histones, and mitochondrial enzymes, in Ixodes scapularis and Amblyomma americanum ticks for months after molting. Residual host proteins may identify sources of infection for ticks.
0 Gastrointestinal dysfunction in the critically ill: can we measure it? Gastrointestinal dysfunction is an intuitively important, yet descriptively elusive component of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Reintam and colleagues have attempted to quantify this dimension using a combination of intolerance of enteral feeding, and the development of intra-abdominal hypertension. While they show that both parameters are associated with an increased risk of death (and therefore that, in combination, the risk of death is even greater), they fall short in developing a novel descriptor of gastrointestinal dysfunction. Nonetheless, and even with its shortcomings, their effort is a welcome contribution to the surprisingly complex process of describing the morbidity of critical illness.
2 Bench-to-bedside review: the initial hemodynamic resuscitation of the septic patient according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines--does one size fit all? The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock recommend that the initial hemodynamic resuscitation be done according to the protocol used by Rivers and colleagues in their well-known early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) study. However, it may well be that their patients were much sicker on admission than many other septic patients. Compared with other populations of septic patients, the patients of Rivers and colleagues had a higher incidence of severe comorbidities, a more severe hemodynamic status on admission (excessively low central venous oxygen saturation [ScvO2], low central venous pressure [CVP], and high lactate), and higher mortality rates. Therefore, it may well be that these patients arrived to the hospital in late untreated hypovolemic sepsis, which may have been due, in part at least, to low socioeconomic status and reduced access to health care. The EGDT protocol uses target values for CVP and ScvO2 to guide hemodynamic management. However, filling pressures do not reliably predict the response to fluid administration, while the ScvO2 of septic patients is characteristically high due to decreased oxygen extraction. For all these reasons, it seems that the hemodynamic component of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines cannot be applied to all septic patients, particularly those who develop sepsis during their hospital stay.
0 Akt regulates drug-induced cell death through Bcl-w downregulation. Akt is a serine threonine kinase with a major role in transducing survival signals and regulating proteins involved in apoptosis. To find new interactors of Akt involved in cell survival, we performed a two-hybrid screening in yeast using human full-length Akt c-DNA as bait and a murine c-DNA library as prey. Among the 80 clones obtained, two were identified as Bcl-w. Bcl-w is a member of the Bcl-2 family that is essential for the regulation of cellular survival, and that is up-regulated in different human tumors, such as gastric and colorectal carcinomas. Direct interaction of Bcl-w with Akt was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays. Subsequently, we addressed the function of this interaction: by interfering with the activity or amount of Akt, we have demonstrated that Akt modulates the amount of Bcl-w protein. We have found that inhibition of Akt activity may promote apoptosis through the downregulation of Bcl-w protein and the consequential reduction in interaction of Bcl-w with pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Our data provide evidence that Bcl-w is a new member of the Akt pathway and that Akt may induce anti-apoptotic signals at least in part through the regulation of the amount and activity of Bcl-w.
0 Hepatitis C virus infection protein network. A proteome-wide mapping of interactions between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human proteins was performed to provide a comprehensive view of the cellular infection. A total of 314 protein-protein interactions between HCV and human proteins was identified by yeast two-hybrid and 170 by literature mining. Integration of this data set into a reconstructed human interactome showed that cellular proteins interacting with HCV are enriched in highly central and interconnected proteins. A global analysis on the basis of functional annotation highlighted the enrichment of cellular pathways targeted by HCV. A network of proteins associated with frequent clinical disorders of chronically infected patients was constructed by connecting the insulin, Jak/STAT and TGFbeta pathways with cellular proteins targeted by HCV. CORE protein appeared as a major perturbator of this network. Focal adhesion was identified as a new function affected by HCV, mainly by NS3 and NS5A proteins.
3 Secondhand smoke exposure in hospitality venues in Europe. Although in the last few years some European countries have implemented smoking bans in hospitality venues, the levels of secondhand smoke (SHS) in this occupational sector could still be extremely high in most countries. The aim of this study was to assess exposure to SHS in hospitality venues in 10 European cities. We included 167 hospitality venues (58 discotheques and pubs, 82 restaurants and cafeterias, and 27 fast-food restaurants) in this cross-sectional study. We carried out fieldwork in 10 European cities: Vienna (Austria), Paris (France), Athens (Greece), Florence and Belluno (Italy), Galway (Ireland), Barcelona (Spain), Warsaw and Lublin (Poland), and Bratislava (Slovak Republic). We measured vapor-phase nicotine as an SHS marker. We analyzed 504 samples and found nicotine in most samples (97.4%). We found the highest median concentrations in discos/pubs [32.99 microg/m(3); interquartile range (IQR), 8.06-66.84 microg/m(3)] and lower median concentrations in restaurants/cafeterias (2.09 microg/m(3); IQR, 0.49-6.73 microg/m(3)) and fast-food restaurants (0.31 microg/m(3); IQR, 0.11-1.30 microg/m(3)) (p < 0.05). We found differences of exposure between countries that may be related to their smoking regulations. Where we sampled smoking and nonsmoking areas, nicotine concentrations were significantly lower in nonsmoking areas. Hospitality venues from European cities without smoking regulations have very high levels of SHS exposure. Monitoring of SHS on a regular basis as well as a total smoking ban in hospitality sector would be needed.
0 TNF-alpha-mediated inflammation in cerebral aneurysms: a potential link to growth and rupture. Intracranial aneurysm (IA) rupture is one of the leading causes of stroke in the United States and remains a major health concern today. Most aneurysms are asymptomatic with a minor percentage of rupture annually. Regardless, IA rupture has a devastatingly high mortality rate and does not have specific drugs that stabilize or prevent aneurysm rupture, though other preventive therapeutic options such as clipping and coiling of incidental aneurysms are available to clinicians. The lack of specific drugs to limit aneurysm growth and rupture is, in part, attributed to the limited knowledge on the biology of IA growth and rupture. Though inflammatory macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrate the aneurysm wall, a link between their presence and aneurysm growth with subsequent rupture is not completely understood. Given our published results that demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), is highly expressed in human ruptured aneurysms, we hypothesize that pro-inflammatory cell types are the prime source of TNF-alpha that initiate damage to endothelium, smooth muscle cells (SMC) and internal elastic lamina (IEL). To gain insights into TNF-alpha expression in the aneurysm wall, we have examined the potential regulators of TNF-alpha and report that higher TNF-alpha expression correlates with increased expression of intracellular calcium release channels that regulate intracellular calcium (Ca2+), and Toll like receptors (TLR) that mediate innate immunity. Moreover, the reduction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) expression provides insights on why higher matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity is noted in ruptured IA. Because TNF-alpha is known to amplify several signaling pathways leading to inflammation, apoptosis and tissue degradation, we will review the potential role of TNF-alpha in IA formation, growth and rupture. Neutralizing TNF-alpha action in the aneurysm wall may have a beneficial effect in preventing aneurysm growth by reducing inflammation and arterial remodeling.
0 Haploinsufficiency of activation-induced deaminase for antibody diversification and chromosome translocations both in vitro and in vivo. The humoral immune response critically relies on the secondary diversification of antibodies. This diversification takes places through somatic remodelling of the antibody genes by two molecular mechanisms, Class Switch Recombination (CSR) and Somatic Hypermutation (SHM). The enzyme Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) initiates both SHM and CSR by deaminating cytosine residues on the DNA of immunoglobulin genes. While crucial for immunity, AID-catalysed deamination is also the triggering event for the generation of lymphomagenic chromosome translocations. To address whether restricting the levels of AID expression in vivo contributes to the regulation of its function, we analysed mice harbouring a single copy of the AID gene (AID(+/-)). AID(+/-) mice express roughly 50% of normal AID levels, and display a mild hyperplasia, reminiscent of AID deficient mice and humans. Moreover, we found that AID(+/-) cells have an impaired competence for CSR and SHM, which indicates that AID gene dose is limiting for its physiologic function. We next evaluated the impact of AID reduction in AID(+/-) mice on the generation of chromosome translocations. Our results show that the frequency of AID-promoted c-myc/IgH translocations is reduced in AID(+/-) mice, both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, AID is haploinsufficient for antibody diversification and chromosome translocations. These findings suggest that limiting the physiologic levels of AID expression can be a regulatory mechanism that ensures an optimal balance between immune proficiency and genome integrity.
2 The role of radiation therapy for carcinoma of the lung. A large proportion of patients with carcinoma of the lung may benefit from the use of radiation therapy. Operable patients have not been shown to benefit from preoperative irradiation, but postoperative irradiation has improved survival in those found to have involvement of hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. Radiation therapy is the only potentially curative treatment for patients who are inoperable, but do not have distant metastasis. Control of the local tumor is very dependent upon dose-fractionation-time relationships. Patients who are relatively asymptomatic, i.e., they have a high performance status, are curable if treated promptly with radiation therapy. Small cell carcinoma requires both radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The optimal method of combining the two modalities is yet to be determined, but prophylactic cranial irradiation is necessary to control microscopic metastases that are not affected by systemic chemotherapy, and thoracic irradiation is necessary to give the highest probability of control of the primary tumor. Prophylactic cranial irradiation has also been shown to reduce the frequency of brain metastasis in patients with squamous carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma; it may become more important in these cell types when more effective chemotherapy is developed.
1 Puumala hantavirus excretion kinetics in bank voles (Myodes glareolus). Puumala hantavirus is present in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and is believed to be spread mainly by contaminated excretions. In this study, we subcutaneously inoculated 10 bank voles with Puumala virus and sampled excretions until day 133 postinfection. Levels of shed viral RNA peaked within 11-28, 14-21, and 11-28 days postinfection for saliva, urine, and feces, respectively. The latest detection of viral RNA was 84, 44, and 44 days postinfection in saliva, urine, and feces, respectively. In contrast, blood of 5 of 6 animals contained viral RNA at day 133 postinfection, suggesting that bank voles secrete virus only during a limited time of the infection. Intranasal inoculations with bank vole saliva, urine, or feces were all infectious for virus-negative bank voles, indicating that these 3 transmission routes may occur in nature and that rodent saliva might play a role in transmission to humans.
3 Hereditary dentine disorders: dentinogenesis imperfecta and dentine dysplasia. The hereditary dentine disorders, dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI) and dentine dysplasia (DD), comprise a group of autosomal dominant genetic conditions characterised by abnormal dentine structure affecting either the primary or both the primary and secondary dentitions. DGI is reported to have an incidence of 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 8,000, whereas that of DD type 1 is 1 in 100,000. Clinically, the teeth are discoloured and show structural defects such as bulbous crowns and small pulp chambers radiographically. The underlying defect of mineralisation often results in shearing of the overlying enamel leaving exposed weakened dentine which is prone to wear. Currently, three sub-types of DGI and two sub-types of DD are recognised but this categorisation may change when other causative mutations are found. DGI type I is inherited with osteogenesis imperfecta and recent genetic studies have shown that mutations in the genes encoding collagen type 1, COL1A1 and COL1A2, underlie this condition. All other forms of DGI and DD, except DD-1, appear to result from mutations in the gene encoding dentine sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), suggesting that these conditions are allelic. Diagnosis is based on family history, pedigree construction and detailed clinical examination, while genetic diagnosis may become useful in the future once sufficient disease-causing mutations have been discovered. Differential diagnoses include hypocalcified forms of amelogenesis imperfecta, congenital erythropoietic porphyria, conditions leading to early tooth loss (Kostmann's disease, cyclic neutropenia, Chediak-Hegashi syndrome, histiocytosis X, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome), permanent teeth discolouration due to tetracyclines, Vitamin D-dependent and vitamin D-resistant rickets. Treatment involves removal of sources of infection or pain, improvement of aesthetics and protection of the posterior teeth from wear. Beginning in infancy, treatment usually continues into adulthood with a number of options including the use of crowns, over-dentures and dental implants depending on the age of the patient and the condition of the dentition. Where diagnosis occurs early in life and treatment follows the outlined recommendations, good aesthetics and function can be obtained.
1 Mortality in the Medicare population and chronic exposure to fine particulate air pollution in urban centers (2000-2005). Prospective cohort studies constitute the major source of evidence about the mortality effects of chronic exposure to particulate air pollution. Additional studies are needed to provide evidence on the health effects of chronic exposure to particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5)) because few studies have been carried out and the cohorts have not been representative. This study was designed to estimate the relative risk of death associated with long-term exposure to PM(2.5) by region and age groups in a U.S. population of elderly, for the period 2000-2005. By linking PM(2.5) monitoring data to the Medicare billing claims by ZIP code of residence of the enrollees, we have developed a new retrospective cohort study, the Medicare Cohort Air Pollution Study. The study population comprises 13.2 million participants living in 4,568 ZIP codes having centroids within 6 miles of a PM(2.5) monitor. We estimated relative risks adjusted by socioeconomic status and smoking by fitting log-linear regression models. In the eastern and central regions, a 10-microg/m(3) increase in 6-year average of PM(2.5) is associated with 6.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.9-8.7%] and 13.2% (95% CI, 9.5-16.9) increases in mortality, respectively. We found no evidence of an association in the western region or for persons > or = 85 years of age. We established a cohort of Medicare participants for investigating air pollution and mortality on longer-term time frames. Chronic exposure to PM(2.5) was associated with mortality in the eastern and central regions, but not in the western United States.
1 Epstein-Barr virus renders the infected natural killer cell line, NKL resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. We established two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected NKL sublines, which acquired stress resistant phenotype against DNA damage and starvation compared with EBV-negative NKL. EBV-rendered doxorubicin resistance at least partially through NF-kappaB activation and the resultant sustenance of antiapoptotic proteins including Bcl-X(L) and FLIP(L/S).
0 Prospects for human monoclonal antibodies: a critical perspective. Monoclonal antibodies have proved useful in detecting antigenic variation at single determinant sites on complex antigens, a fact which seems to have engendered a common misperception that a monoclonal antibody is necessarily a "monospecific" agent. Yet there exists considerable evidence that individual antibody molecules are multispecific in their binding capabilities, and that the amount of functional and genetic redundancy in mammalian immune systems may be quite large. The implications of this data for the future of monoclonal antibodies are emphasized, along with a brief review of present progress toward human monoclonal antibodies.
0 Speech motor learning in profoundly deaf adults. Speech production, like other sensorimotor behaviors, relies on multiple sensory inputs--audition, proprioceptive inputs from muscle spindles and cutaneous inputs from mechanoreceptors in the skin and soft tissues of the vocal tract. However, the capacity for intelligible speech by deaf speakers suggests that somatosensory input alone may contribute to speech motor control and perhaps even to speech learning. We assessed speech motor learning in cochlear implant recipients who were tested with their implants turned off. A robotic device was used to alter somatosensory feedback by displacing the jaw during speech. We found that implant subjects progressively adapted to the mechanical perturbation with training. Moreover, the corrections that we observed were for movement deviations that were exceedingly small, on the order of millimeters, indicating that speakers have precise somatosensory expectations. Speech motor learning is substantially dependent on somatosensory input.
3 Acute myeloid leukemia-targeted toxin activates both apoptotic and necroptotic death mechanisms. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the second most common leukemia with approximately 13,410 new cases and 8,990 deaths annually in the United States. A novel fusion toxin treatment, diphtheria toxin GM-CSF (DT-GMCSF) has been shown to selectively eliminate leukemic repopulating cells that are critical for the formation of AML. We previously showed that DT-GMCSF treatment of U937 cells, an AML cell line, causes activation of caspases and the induction of apoptosis. In this study we further investigate the mechanisms of cell death induced by DT-GMCSF and show that, in addition to the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis, DT-GMCSF also kills AML cells by simultaneously activating caspase-independent necroptosis. These mechanisms depend on the ability of the targeted toxin to inhibit protein synthesis, and are not affected by the receptor that is targeted or the mechanism through which protein synthesis is blocked. We conclude that fusion toxin proteins may be effective for treating AML cells whether or not they are defective in apoptosis.
3 Transmission of Bartonella henselae by Ixodes ricinus. Bartonella spp. are facultative intracellular bacteria associated with several emerging diseases in humans and animals. B. henselae causes cat-scratch disease and is increasingly associated with several other syndromes, particularly ocular infections and endocarditis. Cats are the main reservoir for B. henselae and the bacteria are transmitted to cats by cat fleas. However, new potential vectors are suspected of transmitting B. henselae, in particular, Ixodes ricinus, the most abundant ixodid tick that bites humans in western Europe. We used a membrane-feeding technique to infect I. ricinus with B. henselae and demonstrate transmission of B. henselae within I. ricinus across developmental stages, migration or multiplication of B. henselae in salivary glands after a second meal, and transmission of viable and infective B. henselae from ticks to blood. These results provide evidence that I. ricinus is a competent vector for B. henselae.
2 Acute functional adaptation to nephron loss: micropuncture studies. The renal and proximal tubule response to contralateral kidney exclusion was studied in a variety of circumstances. Recollection micropuncture studies were performed to assess the response to contralateral kidney clamping in the normal or a remnant kidney of the dog. Acute clamping of the contralateral kidney for a normal and unilateral remnant kidney resulted in marked reduction in proximal TF/P inulin ratios in the experimental kidney reflecting a 15 percent reduction in fluid reabsorption. Mean fractional excretion of sodium, potassium and water increased significantly in remnant kidney dogs but no significant change was observed in normal dogs except for potassium excretion. The marked reduction in proximal reabsorption occurred as soon as 5-15 minutes after contralateral kidney clamping and was compensated by distal reabsorption. Acute obstruction of the contralateral ureter results in a similar markedly reduced proximal tubular reabsorption. The reduction in proximal reabsorption induced by contralateral clamping occurred in the presence of reduced perfusion pressure and volume expansion and to some extent with renal denervation. When prostaglandin E(2) or acetycholine were infused prior to contralateral kidney clamping, proximal reabsorption remained at control levels and the contralateral clamping response was blocked. Similar blockade occurred after treatment with indomethacin. Acute reduction in nephron mass causes a marked depression of proximal tubular sodium and fluid absorption not obviously accounted for by hemodynamicphysical factors and humoral factors may be involved. The level of distal reabsorption to increased proximal delivery following contralateral clamping, determines the net urinary excretion.
1 Glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms, passive smoking, obesity, and heart rate variability in nonsmokers. Disturbances of heart rate variability (HRV) may represent one pathway by which second-hand smoke (SHS) and air pollutants affect cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated the hypothesis that oxidative stress alters cardiac autonomic control. We studied the association of polymorphisms in oxidant-scavenging glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes and their interactions with SHS and obesity with HRV. A total of 1,133 nonsmokers > 50 years of age from a population-based Swiss cohort underwent ambulatory 24-hr electrocardiogram monitoring and reported on lifestyle and medical history. We genotyped GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions and a GSTP1 (Ile105Val) single nucleotide polymorphism and analyzed genotype-HRV associations by multiple linear regressions. Homozygous GSTT1 null genotypes exhibited an average 10% decrease in total power (TP) and low-frequency-domain HRV parameters. All three polymorphisms modified the cross-sectional associations of HRV with SHS and obesity. Homozygous GSTM1 null genotypes with > 2 hr/day of SHS exposure exhibited a 26% lower TP [95% confidence interval (CI), 11 to 39%], versus a reduction of -5% (95% CI, -22 to 17%) in subjects with the gene and the same SHS exposure compared with GSTM1 carriers without SHS exposure. Similarly, obese GSTM1 null genotypes had, on average, a 22% (95% CI, 12 to 31%) lower TP, whereas with the gene present obesity was associated with only a 3% decline (95% CI, -15% to 10%) compared with nonobese GSTM1 carriers. GST deficiency is associated with significant HRV alterations in the general population. Its interaction with SHS and obesity in reducing HRV is consistent with an impact of oxidative stress on the autonomous nervous system.
3 Tight glycaemic control in the intensive care unit: pitfalls in the testing of the concept. Tight glycaemic control emerged on the scene of critical care in 2001. Surprisingly, not many confirmation trials have been published so far. The randomised controlled trial by De La Rosa and colleagues is a timely and valuable attempt to repeat the landmark Leuven studies. The failure to replicate the beneficial effects of tight glycaemic control may boil down to some less obvious defaults in the set-up of the trial despite a seemingly adequate study design. The incorporation of ample power calculations and strict adherence to glucose targets are essential to fairly compare studies on tight blood glucose control. Only if these basic conditions of study design are fulfilled can the effectiveness of the therapy be assessed.
2 Circuit lifespan during continuous renal replacement therapy: children and adults are not equal. In the field of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), session length, downtime and dose require detailed research, which will provide information important in relation to prescription, anticoagulation and circuit material choice (membrane type and size, vascular access site and size). In particular, it appears that many of the data currently existing in the literature and accepted regarding CRRT prescription and delivery in critically ill adult patients are not strictly applicable to the paediatric setting. Furthermore, many of the available paediatric studies are small, retrospective or underpowered. In paediatric CRRT, epidemiological investigations and prospective trials to investigate practical aspects of extracorporeal therapies are welcome and urgently needed.
0 Effect of acute exercise stress in cardiac hypertrophy: I. correlation of regional blood flow and qualitative ultrastructural changes. Ultrastructural myocardial cell changes were determined in eight miniswine after the development of pressure-overload hypertrophy induced by supra-valvular aortic constriction. Four miniswine served as control animals. Regional myocardial blood flows were measured at rest and during exercise stress with radioactive microspheres after two days and one month of aortic constriction. Exercise stress, causing the heart rate to increase to 85 percent of its maximum, was imposed twice weekly for 7 minutes on four pressure-overloaded animals and the four control animals to elicit differences between the control and experimental groups that might not occur at rest. After one month of pressure overload the swine were killed and myocardial samples were processed for electron microscopy. Ultrastructural changes similar to those in hypertrophied hearts were present throughout the left ventricular walls of the pressure-overloaded animals. Other changes consistent with ischemic injury were present in the subendocardial regions of pressure-overloaded animals subjected to exercise stress. These changes included disorganization of myofibrils, disintegration and broadening of Z-bands, swelling and aggregation of mitochondria, electron-dense deposits in mitochondria, decreased cristal density and vacuolization of mitochondria, intracellular edema, margination and clumping of nuclear chromatin, and a decrease of glycogen granules. Regional ischemia in the subendocardium of these animals was confirmed by functional studies which showed decreased regional myocardial blood flow to the subendocardium during exercise and S-T segment elevation for the first 2-10 days after inducing pressure overload. The ischemia, as shown by flow studies, during exercise stress persisted in the compensatory stage of hypertrophy although S-T segments returned to normal. Thus, the combined effect of pressure overload and exercise stress can produce focal subendocardial ischemia in the compensated, hypertrophied heart.
1 Protochlamydia naegleriophila as etiologic agent of pneumonia. Using ameba coculture, we grew a Naegleria endosymbiont. Phenotypic, genetic, and phylogenetic analyses supported its affiliation as Protochlamydia naegleriophila sp. nov. We then developed a specific diagnostic PCR for Protochlamydia spp. When applied to bronchoalveolar lavages, results of this PCR were positive for 1 patient with pneumonia. Further studies are needed to assess the role of Protochlamydia spp. in pneumonia.
3 The triple helix--NIH, industry, and the academic world. Spectacular accomplishments in biomedical research have given birth to what is now perceived as a biological revolution, an epoch in which man has acquired the skill to manipulate the fundamental unit of heredity, the gene. This revolution carries with it the prospect of remarkable opportunities to improve the quality of life and to probe with increasing precision the mysteries of cellular organization and function. It comes, however, at a time when the opportunity to exploit this new knowledge may be limited by a significant reduction in federal support of basic research, and a situation which prompts universities and other centers of scientific activity to seek funding from industrial patrons. This trend has generated a new constellation of institutional challenges, for one apparent result of industrial sponsorship of university-based biomedical research is a threat to university governance as altered allegiances emerge and as the potential for financial gain appears almost limitless. This essay explores background issues leading to these new alliances, seeks to identify some of the central problems emerging for university administrators, faculty, and students, and then poses a key question: Can industrial support for university-based biomedical research fill the apparent short-fall in federal dollars in the foreseeable future? An analysis of available data indicates that this outcome is unlikely either now or in the years ahead.
0 Evolutionary sequence modeling for discovery of peptide hormones. There are currently a large number of "orphan" G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) whose endogenous ligands (peptide hormones) are unknown. Identification of these peptide hormones is a difficult and important problem. We describe a computational framework that models spatial structure along the genomic sequence simultaneously with the temporal evolutionary path structure across species and show how such models can be used to discover new functional molecules, in particular peptide hormones, via cross-genomic sequence comparisons. The computational framework incorporates a priori high-level knowledge of structural and evolutionary constraints into a hierarchical grammar of evolutionary probabilistic models. This computational method was used for identifying novel prohormones and the processed peptide sites by producing sequence alignments across many species at the functional-element level. Experimental results with an initial implementation of the algorithm were used to identify potential prohormones by comparing the human and non-human proteins in the Swiss-Prot database of known annotated proteins. In this proof of concept, we identified 45 out of 54 prohormones with only 44 false positives. The comparison of known and hypothetical human and mouse proteins resulted in the identification of a novel putative prohormone with at least four potential neuropeptides. Finally, in order to validate the computational methodology, we present the basic molecular biological characterization of the novel putative peptide hormone, including its identification and regional localization in the brain. This species comparison, HMM-based computational approach succeeded in identifying a previously undiscovered neuropeptide from whole genome protein sequences. This novel putative peptide hormone is found in discreet brain regions as well as other organs. The success of this approach will have a great impact on our understanding of GPCRs and associated pathways and help to identify new targets for drug development.
0 Regulating polarity by directing traffic: Cdc42 prevents adherens junctions from crumblin' aPart. The GTPase Cdc42 was among the original genes identified with roles in cell polarity, and interest in its cellular roles from yeast to humans remains high. Cdc42 is a well-known regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, but also plays important roles in vesicular trafficking. In this issue, Harris and Tepass (Harris, K.P, and U. Tepass. 2008. J. Cell. Biol. 183:1129-1143) provide new insights into how Cdc42 and Par proteins work together to modulate cell adhesion and polarity during embryonic morphogenesis by regulating the traffic of key cell junction proteins.
0 Prolonged Bartonella henselae bacteremia caused by reinfection in cats. We analyzed the genetic relatedness of blood culture isolates of Bartonella henselae from 2 cats of patients with cat-scratch disease at admission and after 12 months. Isolates from each cat at different times were clonally unrelated, which suggested reinfection by a second strain.
2 BRAF activation initiates but does not maintain invasive prostate adenocarcinoma. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Activation of MAP kinase signaling pathway has been implicated in advanced and androgen-independent prostate cancers, although formal genetic proof has been lacking. In the course of modeling malignant melanoma in a tyrosinase promoter transgenic system, we developed a genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) model of invasive prostate cancers, whereby an activating mutation of BRAF(V600E)--a mutation found in approximately 10% of human prostate tumors--was targeted to the epithelial compartment of the prostate gland on the background of Ink4a/Arf deficiency. These GEM mice developed prostate gland hyperplasia with progression to rapidly growing invasive adenocarcinoma without evidence of AKT activation, providing genetic proof that activation of MAP kinase signaling is sufficient to drive prostate tumorigenesis. Importantly, genetic extinction of BRAF(V600E) in established prostate tumors did not lead to tumor regression, indicating that while sufficient to initiate development of invasive prostate adenocarcinoma, BRAF(V600E) is not required for its maintenance.
3 Dendritic spike saturation of endogenous calcium buffer and induction of postsynaptic cerebellar LTP. The architecture of parallel fiber axons contacting cerebellar Purkinje neurons retains spatial information over long distances. Parallel fiber synapses can trigger local dendritic calcium spikes, but whether and how this calcium signal leads to plastic changes that decode the parallel fiber input organization is unknown. By combining voltage and calcium imaging, we show that calcium signals, elicited by parallel fiber stimulation and mediated by voltage-gated calcium channels, increase non-linearly during high-frequency bursts of electrically constant calcium spikes, because they locally and transiently saturate the endogenous buffer. We demonstrate that these non-linear calcium signals, independently of NMDA or metabotropic glutamate receptor activation, can induce parallel fiber long-term potentiation. Two-photon imaging in coronal slices revealed that calcium signals inducing long-term potentiation can be observed by stimulating either the parallel fiber or the ascending fiber pathway. We propose that local dendritic calcium spikes, evoked by synaptic potentials, provide a unique mechanism to spatially decode parallel fiber signals into cerebellar circuitry changes.
3 Cluster of falciparum malaria cases in UK airport. A cluster of 6 cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria occurred in a UK airport among 30 travelers returning to the United States from East Africa. Molecular genotyping analysis indicated that all had been exposed to different parasites. The travelers' use of chemoprophylaxis was poor; their perception of risk was limited.
3 Frontal EEG for intensive care unit sedation: treating numbers or patients? In this issue of Critical Care, Dr Haenggi and co-workers present a study evaluating bispectral index (BIS), state entropy (SE) and response entropy in 44 patients sedated in the intensive care unit (ICU). As in recent studies attempting to correlate frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements with clinical evaluations of sedative efficacy, there is considerable overlap in numerical EEG values and different clinical levels of sedation. This precludes the use of these monitors for monitoring or titrating sedation in the critically ill. Despite many attempts, no study has yet presented data showing improved outcome with the use of EEG monitors in ICU sedation. Meanwhile, clinical sedation protocols have emerged, improving important endpoints in critically ill patients needing sedation. A major underlying problem in applying EEG monitors in the ICU is that they have been developed for measuring anesthetic depth and the related risk of recall, rather than the acknowledged endpoints of sedation, namely reduction of anxiety and discomfort. Until an 'objective' monitor is developed to measure the degree of such symptoms, physicians should continue treating patients and not numbers.
0 High genetic diversity of measles virus, World Health Organization European Region, 2005-2006. During 2005-2006, nine measles virus (MV) genotypes were identified throughout the World Health Organization European Region. All major epidemics were associated with genotypes D4, D6, and B3. Other genotypes (B2, D5, D8, D9, G2, and H1) were only found in limited numbers of cases after importation from other continents. The genetic diversity of endemic D6 strains was low; genotypes C2 and D7, circulating in Europe until recent years, were no longer identified. The transmission chains of several indigenous MV strains may thus have been interrupted by enhanced vaccination. However, multiple importations from Africa and Asia and virus introduction into highly mobile and unvaccinated communities caused a massive spread of D4 and B3 strains throughout much of the region. Thus, despite the reduction of endemic MV circulation, importation of MV from other continents caused prolonged circulation and large outbreaks after their introduction into unvaccinated and highly mobile communities.
1 Compositional genome contexts affect gene expression control in sea urchin embryo. Gene expression is widely perceived as exclusively controlled by the information contained in cis-regulatory regions. These are built in a modular way, each module being a cluster of binding sites for the transcription factors that control the level, the location and the time at which gene transcription takes place. On the other hand, results from our laboratory have shown that gene expression is affected by the compositional properties (GC levels) of the isochores in which genes are embedded, i.e. the genome context. To clarify how compositional genomic properties affect the way cis-regulatory information is utilized, we have changed the genome context of a GFP-reporter gene containing the complete cis-regulatory region of the gene spdeadringer (spdri), expressed during sea urchin embryogenesis. We have observed that GC levels higher or lower than those found in the natural genome context can alter the reporter expression pattern. We explain this as the result of an interference with the functionality of specific modules in the gene's cis-regulatory region. From these observations we derive the notion that the compositional properties of the genome context can affect cis-regulatory control of gene expression. Therefore although the way a gene works depends on the information contained in its cis-regulatory region, availability of such information depends on the compositional properties of the genomic context.
0 Systematic literature review of role of noroviruses in sporadic gastroenteritis. We conducted a systematic review of studies that used reverse transcription-PCR to diagnose norovirus (NoV) infections in patients with mild or moderate (outpatient) and severe (hospitalized) diarrhea. NoVs accounted for 12%(95% confidence interval [CI] 10%-15%) of severe gastroenteritis cases among children <5 years of age and 12% (95% CI 9%-15%) of mild and moderate diarrhea cases among persons of all ages. Of 19 studies among children <5 years of age, 7 were in developing countries where pooled prevalence of severe NoV disease (12%) was comparable to that for industrialized countries (12%). We estimate that each year NoVs cause 64,000 episodes of diarrhea requiring hospitalization and 900,000 clinic visits among children in industrialized countries, and up to 200,000 deaths of children <5 years of age in developing countries. Future efforts should focus on developing targeted strategies, possibly even vaccines, for preventing NoV disease and better documenting their impact among children living in developing countries, where >95% of the deaths from diarrhea occur.
0 The pig as a model for the study of obesity and of control of food intake: a review. The use of the pig for studies of food intake and obesity is reviewed. Effects of ambient temperature and taste on food intake as well as satiety factors impicating both neural and hormonal mechanisms originating in the gastrointestinal tract are considered; the integration of information in the central nervous system for both internal and external sources is hypothesized. Special concerns of food intake controls in the neonate are discussed, including effects of neonate sweet preference on food intake, gastrointestinal satiety factors, and hypoglycemia as a stimulus for food ingestion.For obesity studies, pigs offer several advantages, including their general physiological similarity to humans, similar fat cell size, and body fat distribution. Lipogenesis, lipolysis, and lipid mobilization are under intensive study in swine and the information obtained may have important application in studies of human obesity. The voluminous literature on metabolic differences between genetically lean versus obese populations of pigs suggests possibilities for application in humans. Greater characterization of differences and similarities between pigs and humans in important metabolic parameters related to regulation of food intake and obesity should facilitate better understanding and control of human obesity.
3 CB1 expression is attenuated in Fallopian tube and decidua of women with ectopic pregnancy. Embryo retention in the Fallopian tube (FT) is thought to lead to ectopic pregnancy (EP), a considerable cause of morbidity. In mice, genetic/pharmacological silencing of cannabinoid receptor Cnr1, encoding CB1, causes retention of embryos in the oviduct. The role of the endocannabinoids in tubal implantation in humans is not known. Timed FT biopsies (n = 18) were collected from women undergoing gynecological procedures for benign conditions. Endometrial biopsies and whole blood were collected from women undergoing surgery for EP (n = 11); management of miscarriage (n = 6), and termination of pregnancy (n = 8). Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, CB1 mRNA and protein expression levels/patterns were examined in FT and endometrial biopsies. The distribution of two polymorphisms of CNR1 was examined by TaqMan analysis of genomic DNA from the whole blood samples. In normal FT, CB1 mRNA was higher in luteal compared to follicular-phase (p<0.05). CB1 protein was located in smooth muscle of the wall and of endothelial vessels, and luminal epithelium of FT. In FT from women with EP, CB1 mRNA expression was low. CB1 mRNA expression was also significantly lower (p<0.05) in endometrium of women with EP compared to intrauterine pregnancies (IUP). Although of 1359G/A (rs1049353) polymorphisms of CNR1 gene suggests differential distribution of genotypes between the small, available cohorts of women with EP and those with IUP, results were not statistically significant. CB1 mRNA shows temporal variation in expression in human FT, likely regulated by progesterone. CB1 mRNA is expressed in low levels in both the FT and endometrium of women with EP. We propose that aberrant endocannabinoid-signaling in human FT leads to EP. Furthermore, our finding of reduced mRNA expression along with a possible association between polymorphism genotypes of the CNR1 gene and EP, suggests a possible genetic predisposition to EP that warrants replication in a larger sample pool.
3 Focal distortion of the nuclear envelope by huntingtin aggregates revealed by lamin immunostaining. Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine repeat tract in the huntingtin protein. Polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin forms intranuclear as well as perinuclear inclusion bodies. Perinuclear aggregates formed by polyglutamine-expanded proteins are associated with a characteristic indentation of the nuclear envelope. We examined the nuclear envelope in cells containing huntingtin aggregates using immunostaining for lamin B1, a major component of the nuclear lamina. Laser confocal microscopy analysis revealed that huntingtin aggregates in a juxtanuclear position were associated with a clear focal distortion in the nuclear envelope in cells transfected with polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. Lamin B1 distribution was not altered by aggregates of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1, that are exclusively intranuclear. Thus lamin immunocytochemistry demonstrates clearly the depression of the nuclear envelope resulting from the formation of perinuclear aggregates by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. Lamin immunocytochemistry would be of value to monitor the state of the nuclear envelope in experimental paradigms aimed at establishing the significance of perinuclear aggregates of pathogenic proteins.
3 Burial records for the parish of St. Anne Soho, London, in 1814-1828. Of the deaths recorded in the St. Anne Soho funeral day books from 1814 through 1828, nearly half were for children under 5 yr of age. Relatively few persons died from age 5 to age 15, but then the proportion of deaths rose steadily to a peak in the 40-49-year group. Decline, convulsions, and inflammation account for about half of all deaths, the causes of which were often vague and inexact.
0 Transmission of hepatitis C virus during computed tomography scanning with contrast. Six cases of acute hepatitis C related to computed tomography scanning with contrast were identified in 3 hospitals. A patient with chronic hepatitis C had been subjected to the same procedure immediately before each patient who developed acute infection. Viral molecular analysis showed identity between isolates from cases with acute and chronic hepatitis C.
3 Paraquat suicide in a young woman: results of therapy directed against the superoxide radical. The clinical course of a young woman following two separate suicide attempts using the herbicide paraquat is reported. The patient survived an intramuscular injection of paraquat almost asymptomatically, but later exhibited a typical fatal course with fulminant proliferative pulmonary fibrosis after an intravenous injection. Fibrosis and death occurred despite a therapeutic regimen based upon a known action of paraquat, the generation of superoxide (O(2)[unk]), using superoxide dismutase, α-tocopherol, and ascorbic acid in conjunction with forced diuresis and prednisone. While treatment failed explanations for the failure of therapy in this case and current therapeutic alternatives are discussed so that they may be considered when future cases are encountered.
1 Design and analysis of ChIP-seq experiments for DNA-binding proteins. Recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of DNA-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). Although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative ChIP microarray (ChIP-chip), few approaches have been described for processing ChIP-seq data. To fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. Using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. We compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. We also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.
0 Bitter taste receptors influence glucose homeostasis. TAS1R- and TAS2R-type taste receptors are expressed in the gustatory system, where they detect sweet- and bitter-tasting stimuli, respectively. These receptors are also expressed in subsets of cells within the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, where they mediate nutrient assimilation and endocrine responses. For example, sweeteners stimulate taste receptors on the surface of gut enteroendocrine L cells to elicit an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) and secretion of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an important modulator of insulin biosynthesis and secretion. Because of the importance of taste receptors in the regulation of food intake and the alimentary responses to chemostimuli, we hypothesized that differences in taste receptor efficacy may impact glucose homeostasis. To address this issue, we initiated a candidate gene study within the Amish Family Diabetes Study and assessed the association of taste receptor variants with indicators of glucose dysregulation, including a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and high levels of blood glucose and insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test. We report that a TAS2R haplotype is associated with altered glucose and insulin homeostasis. We also found that one SNP within this haplotype disrupts normal responses of a single receptor, TAS2R9, to its cognate ligands ofloxacin, procainamide and pirenzapine. Together, these findings suggest that a functionally compromised TAS2R receptor negatively impacts glucose homeostasis, providing an important link between alimentary chemosensation and metabolic disease.
3 The growth and tumor suppressors NORE1A and RASSF1A are targets for calpain-mediated proteolysis. NORE1A and RASSF1A are growth and tumour suppressors inactivated in a variety of cancers. Methylation of NORE1A and RASSF1A promoters is the predominant mechanism for downregulation of these proteins; however, other mechanisms are likely to exist. Here we describe a proteolysis of NORE1A and RASSF1A by calpains as alternative mechanism of their downregulation. Extracts of H358 cell line, a human bronchoalveolar carcinoma, and H460, a large cell carcinoma, were capable of proteolysis of NORE1A protein in the calpain-dependent manner. Likewise, RASSF1A tumor suppressor was proteolyzed by the H358 cell extract. Addition of calpain inhibitor to H358 and H460 cells growing in tissue culture resulted in re-expression of endogenous NORE1A. A survey of 10 human lung tumours revealed that three of them contain an activity capable of inducing NORE1A degradation. Thus, degradation by calpains is a novel mechanism for downregulation of NORE1A and RASSF1A proteins and might be the mechanism allowing cancer cells to escape growth suppression.
3 Population-level effect of HSV-2 therapy on the incidence of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection increases acquisition and transmission of HIV, but the results of trials measuring the impact of HSV-2 therapy on HIV genital shedding and HIV acquisition are mixed, and the potential impact of HSV-2 therapy on the incidence of HIV at the population level is unknown. The effects of episodic and suppressive HSV-2 therapy were simulated using the individual-level model STDSIM fitted to data from Cotonou, Benin (relatively low HIV prevalence) and Kisumu, Kenya (high HIV prevalence). Clinician- and patient-initiated episodic therapy, started when symptomatic, were assumed to reduce ulcer duration. Suppressive therapy, given regardless of symptoms, was also assumed to reduce ulcer frequency and HSV-2 infectiousness. Clinician-initiated episodic therapy in the general population had almost no effect on the incidence of HIV. The impact of patient-initiated therapy was higher because of earlier treatment initiation, but still low (<5%) unless symptom recognition and treatment-seeking behaviour were very high. Suppressive therapy given to female sex workers (FSW) in Kisumu had little effect on population HIV incidence. In Cotonou, suppressive therapy in FSW with high coverage and long duration reduced population HIV incidence by >20% in the long term. Impact was increased in both cities by also treating a proportion of their clients. Long-term suppressive therapy with high coverage in the general population could reduce HIV incidence by more than 30%. These results show that HSV-2 therapy could potentially have a population-level impact on the incidence of HIV, especially in more concentrated epidemics. However, a substantial impact requires high coverage and long duration therapy, or very high symptom recognition and treatment-seeking behaviour.
3 Henipavirus infection in fruit bats (Pteropus giganteus), India. We tested 41 bats for antibodies against Nipah and Hendra viruses to determine whether henipaviruses circulate in pteropid fruit bats (Pteropus giganteus) in northern India. Twenty bats were seropositive for Nipah virus, which suggests circulation in this species, thereby extending the known distribution of henipaviruses in Asia westward by >1,000 km.
0 Phosphorylation regulates targeting of cytoplasmic dynein to kinetochores during mitosis. Cytoplasmic dynein functions at several sites during mitosis; however, the basis of targeting to each site remains unclear. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of mitotic dynein revealed a phosphorylation site in the dynein intermediate chains (ICs) that mediates binding to kinetochores. IC phosphorylation directs binding to zw10 rather than dynactin, and this interaction is needed for kinetochore dynein localization. Phosphodynein associates with kinetochores from nuclear envelope breakdown to metaphase, but bioriented microtubule (MT) attachment and chromosome alignment induce IC dephosphorylation. IC dephosphorylation stimulates binding to dynactin and poleward streaming. MT depolymerization, release of kinetochore tension, and a PP1-gamma mutant each inhibited IC dephosphorylation, leading to the retention of phosphodynein at kinetochores and reduced poleward streaming. The depletion of kinetochore dynactin by moderate levels of p50(dynamitin) expression disrupted the ability of dynein to remove checkpoint proteins by streaming at metaphase but not other aspects of kinetochore dynein activity. Together, these results suggest a new model for localization of kinetochore dynein and the contribution of kinetochore dynactin.
3 Rolling circle amplification-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR) library construction in plants. Long hairpin RNA (lhRNA) construct-induced gene silencing facilitates the study of gene function in plants and animals, but constructing multiple lhRNA vectors using traditional approaches is both time-consuming and costly. Also, most of the existing approaches are based on sequence-specific cloning of individual sequences, and are therefore not suitable for preparing hpRNA libraries from a pool of mixed target sequences. Here we describe a rolling-circle amplification (RCA)-mediated hpRNA (RMHR) construction system suitable for generating libraries of lhRNA constructs from any gene of interest or pool of genes. Using RMHR we successfully generated a lhRNA library from a Arabidopsis cDNA population containing known and unknown genes, with an average size of 500-800 bp for the inverted-repeat inserts. To validate the RMHR system, lhRNA constructs targeting the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene were tested using Agrobacterium infiltration and shown to be effective at inducing GUS silencing in tobacco leaves. Our results indicate that the RMHR technique permits rapid, efficient and low-cost preparation of genome-wide lhRNA expression libraries.
1 Recognition of a common rDNA target site in archaea and eukarya by analogous LAGLIDADG and His-Cys box homing endonucleases. The presence of a homing endonuclease gene (HEG) within a microbial intron or intein empowers the entire element with the ability to invade genomic targets. The persistence of a homing endonuclease lineage depends in part on conservation of its DNA target site. One such rDNA sequence has been invaded both in archaea and in eukarya, by LAGLIDADG and His-Cys box homing endonucleases, respectively. The bases encoded by this target include a universally conserved ribosomal structure, termed helix 69 (H69) in the large ribosomal subunit. This region forms the 'B2a' intersubunit bridge to the small ribosomal subunit, contacts bound tRNA in the A- and P-sites, and acts as a trigger for ribosome disassembly through its interactions with ribosome recycling factor. We have determined the DNA-bound structure and specificity profile of an archaeal LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease (I-Vdi141I) that recognizes this target site, and compared its specificity with the analogous eukaryal His-Cys box endonuclease I-PpoI. These homodimeric endonuclease scaffolds have arrived at similar specificity profiles across their common biological target and analogous solutions to the problem of accommodating conserved asymmetries within the DNA sequence, but with differences at individual base pairs that are fine-tuned to the sequence conservation of archaeal versus eukaryal ribosomes.
1 Never resting brain: simultaneous representation of two alpha related processes in humans. Brain activity is continuously modulated, even at "rest". The alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) has been known as the hallmark of the brain's idle-state. However, it is still debated if the alpha rhythm reflects synchronization in a distributed network or focal generator and whether it occurs spontaneously or is driven by a stimulus. This EEG/fMRI study aimed to explore the source of alpha modulations and their distribution in the resting brain. By serendipity, while computing the individually defined power modulations of the alpha-band, two simultaneously occurring components of these modulations were found. An 'induced alpha' that was correlated with the paradigm (eyes open/ eyes closed), and a 'spontaneous alpha' that was on-going and unrelated to the paradigm. These alpha components when used as regressors for BOLD activation revealed two segregated activation maps: the 'induced map' included left lateral temporal cortical regions and the hippocampus; the 'spontaneous map' included prefrontal cortical regions and the thalamus. Our combined fMRI/EEG approach allowed to computationally untangle two parallel patterns of alpha modulations and underpin their anatomical basis in the human brain. These findings suggest that the human alpha rhythm represents at least two simultaneously occurring processes which characterize the 'resting brain'; one is related to expected change in sensory information, while the other is endogenous and independent of stimulus change.
3 CaMKII locally encodes L-type channel activity to signal to nuclear CREB in excitation-transcription coupling. Communication between cell surface proteins and the nucleus is integral to many cellular adaptations. In the case of ion channels in excitable cells, the dynamics of signaling to the nucleus are particularly important because the natural stimulus, surface membrane depolarization, is rapidly pulsatile. To better understand excitation-transcription coupling we characterized the dependence of cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation, a critical step in neuronal plasticity, on the level and duration of membrane depolarization. We find that signaling strength is steeply dependent on depolarization, with sensitivity far greater than hitherto recognized. In contrast, graded blockade of the Ca(2+) channel pore has a remarkably mild effect, although some Ca(2+) entry is absolutely required. Our data indicate that Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase II acting near the channel couples local Ca(2+) rises to signal transduction, encoding the frequency of Ca(2+) channel openings rather than integrated Ca(2+) flux-a form of digital logic.
3 Characterization of biofilm matrix, degradation by DNase treatment and evidence of capsule downregulation in Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common respiratory pathogen and a major causative agent of respiratory infections, including otitis media (OM). Pneumococcal biofilms have been demonstrated on biopsies of the middle ear mucosa in children receiving tympanostomy tubes, supporting the hypothesis that chronic OM may involve biofilm development by pathogenic bacteria as part of the infectious process. To better understand pneumococcal biofilm formation six low-passage encapsulated nasopharyngeal isolates of S. pneumoniae were assessed over a six-eight day period in vitro. Multiparametric analysis divided the strains into two groups. Those with a high biofilm forming index (BFI) were structurally complex, exhibited greater lectin colocalization and were more resistant to azithromycin. Those with a low BFI developed less extensive biofilms and were more susceptible to azithromycin. dsDNA was present in the S. pneumoniae biofilm matrix in all strains and treatment with DNase I significantly reduced biofilm biomass. Since capsule expression has been hypothesized to be associated with decreased biofilm development, we also examined expression of cpsA, the first gene in the pneumococcal capsule operon. Interestingly, cpsA was downregulated in biofilms in both high and low BFI strains. All pneumococcal strains developed biofilms that exhibited extracellular dsDNA in the biofilm matrix, however strains with a high BFI correlated with greater carbohydrate-associated structural complexity and antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, all strains of S. pneumoniae showed downregulation of the cpsA gene during biofilm growth compared to planktonic culture, regardless of BFI ranking, suggesting downregulation of capsule expression occurs generally during adherent growth.
0 Hyperglycemia may alter cytokine production and phagocytosis by means other than hyperosmotic stress. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Otto and colleagues used in vitro studies to explore the theory that immunomodulation, by correction of hyperglycemia, may be a contributing factor to the reported efficacy of intensive insulin therapy (IIT) in critically ill patients. They suggested that hyperglycemia via hyperosmolarity at supra-physiological levels potentiates the production of cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and that it also reduces the responses of phagocytosis and oxidative burst in human granulocytes. The efficacy of IIT, they concluded, may be partially due to the correction of hyperosmolality. Other studies, however, have suggested that immunological responses to LPS in the presence of hyperglycemia are mediated by a mechanism other than hyperosmolality.
3 Risk-benefit stratification as a guide to lidocaine prophylaxis of primary ventricular fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction: an analytic review. Early investigators suggested that ventricular fibrillation without heart failure in acute myocardial infarction was reliably preceded by warning arrhythmias, and that suppression of such arrhythmias with intravenous lidocaine could avoid the need for resuscitation. While the efficacy and safety of lidocaine have been substantiated, the reliability of warning arrhythmias as predictors for primary ventricular fibrillation has not. We present data showing that the risk of primary ventricular fibrillation is most dependent on the patient's age and the interval since the onset of his symptoms, rather than on the presence of warning arrhythmias. We have estimated that lidocaine prophylaxis would have to be given to about 12 patients in the highest risk group (patients under age 50 and within six hours of the onset of symptoms), compared to about 400 patients in the lowest risk group (patients above age 70 and more than 24 hours since the onset of symptoms), to prevent one episode of primary ventricular fibrillation in each group. We propose that these risk stratifications, as adapted to the conditions in specific hospitals, provide the most rational approach to lidocaine prophylaxis of primary ventricular fibrillation.
1 Are biologics more effective than classical disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs? Major achievements have been reached in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis during past decades due to the recognition of methotrexate as an anchor drug for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, due to the notion of a treatment window of opportunity in patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis necessitating early aggressive therapy, due to the development of biologics and due to remission as a treatment target. Most biologics have a much faster onset of action than synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, but presently there is no convincing evidence that biologic drugs have a superior clinical efficacy in comparison with the synthetic drugs. Biologics are, however, accompanied by less radiological deterioration.
0 Synapsis and catalysis by activated Tn3 resolvase mutants. The serine recombinase Tn3 resolvase catalyses recombination between two 114 bp res sites, each of which contains binding sites for three resolvase dimers. We have analysed the in vitro properties of resolvase variants with 'activating' mutations, which can catalyse recombination at binding site I of res when the rest of res is absent. Site I x site I recombination promoted by these variants can be as fast as res x res recombination promoted by wild-type resolvase. Activated variants have reduced topological selectivity and no longer require the 2-3' interface between subunits that is essential for wild-type resolvase-mediated recombination. They also promote formation of a stable synapse comprising a resolvase tetramer and two copies of site I. Cleavage of the DNA strands by the activated mutants is slow relative to the rate of synapsis. Stable resolvase tetramers were not detected in the absence of DNA or bound to a single site I. Our results lead us to conclude that the synapse is assembled by sequential binding of resolvase monomers to site I followed by interaction of two site I-dimer complexes. We discuss the implications of our results for the mechanisms of synapsis and regulation in recombination by wild-type resolvase.
2 New Insight in Loss of Gut Barrier during Major Non-Abdominal Surgery. Gut barrier loss has been implicated as a critical event in the occurrence of postoperative complications. We aimed to study the development of gut barrier loss in patients undergoing major non-abdominal surgery. Twenty consecutive children undergoing spinal fusion surgery were included. This kind of surgery is characterized by long operation time, significant blood loss, prolonged systemic hypotension, without directly leading to compromise of the intestines by intestinal manipulation or use of extracorporeal circulation. Blood was collected preoperatively, every two hours during surgery and 2, 4, 15 and 24 hours postoperatively. Gut mucosal barrier was assessed by plasma markers for enterocyte damage (I-FABP, I-BABP) and urinary presence of tight junction protein claudin-3. Intestinal mucosal perfusion was measured by gastric tonometry (P(r)CO2, P(r-a)CO2-gap). Plasma concentration of I-FABP, I-BABP and urinary expression of claudin-3 increased rapidly and significantly after the onset of surgery in most children. Postoperatively, all markers decreased promptly towards baseline values together with normalisation of MAP. Plasma levels of I-FABP, I-BABP were significantly negatively correlated with MAP at (1/2) hour before blood sampling (-0.726 (p<0.001), -0.483 (P<0.001), respectively). Furthermore, circulating I-FABP correlated with gastric mucosal P(r)CO2, P(r-a)CO2-gap measured at the same time points (0.553 (p = 0.040), 0.585 (p = 0.028), respectively). This study shows the development of gut barrier loss in children undergoing major non-abdominal surgery, which is related to preceding hypotension and mesenterial hypoperfusion. These data shed new light on the potential role of peroperative circulatory perturbation and intestinal barrier loss.
0 Cytotoxicity mechanism of two naphthoquinones (menadione and plumbagin) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Quinones are compounds extensively used in studies of oxidative stress due to their role in plants as chemicals for defense. These compounds are of great interest for pharmacologists and scientists, in general, because several cancer chemotherapeutic agents contain the quinone nucleus. However, due to differences in structures and diverse pharmacological effects, the exact toxicity mechanisms exerted by quinones are far from elucidatation. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we evaluated the main mechanisms of toxicity of two naphthoquinones, menadione and plumbagin, by determining tolerance and oxidative stress biomarkers such as GSH and GSSG, lipid peroxidation levels, as well as aconitase activity. The importance of glutathione transferases (GST) in quinone detoxification was also addressed. The GSSG/GSH ratio showed that menadione seemed to exert its toxicity mainly through the generation of ROS while plumbagin acted as an electrophile reacting with GSH. However, the results showed that, even by different pathways, both drugs were capable of generating oxidative stress through their toxic effects. Our results showed that the control strain, BY4741, and the glutathione transferase deficient strains (gtt1Delta and gtt2Delta) were sensitive to both compounds. With respect to the role of GST isoforms in cellular protection against quinone toxicity, we observed that the Gtt2 deficient strain was unable to overcome lipid peroxidation, even after a plumbagin pre-treatment, indicating that this treatment did not improve tolerance when compared with the wild type strain. Cross-tolerance experiments confirmed distinct cytotoxicity mechanisms for these naphthoquinones since only a pre-treatment with menadione was able to induce acquisition of tolerance against stress with plumbagin. These results suggest different responses to menadione and plumbagin which could be due to the fact that these compounds use different mechanisms to exert their toxicity. In addition, the Gtt2 isoform seemed to act as a general protective factor involved in quinone detoxification.
3 Reprogramming chick RPE progeny cells to differentiate towards retinal neurons by ash1. Harnessing a cell culture of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to give rise to retinal neurons may offer a source of developing neurons for cell-replacement studies. This study explores the possibility of reprogramming RPE progeny cells to differentiate toward retinal neurons with achaete-scute homolog 1 (ash1), a proneural gene that is expressed in progenitor cells in the developing retina and promotes amacrine cell production when overexpressed in the chick retina. Replication Competent Avian Splice (RCAS) retrovirus was used to drive the ectopic expression of ash1 in cell cultures of dissociated RPE isolated from day 6 chick embryos. RCAS expressing green fluorescent protein (RCAS-GFP) was used as control. The cultures were examined for de novo generation of neuron-like cells by molecular, cellular, and physiologic criteria. In control cultures infected with RCAS-GFP, RPE cells appeared cobblestone-like and often darkly pigmented. In cultures infected with RCAS-ash1, however, cells remained de-pigmented and frequently formed clusters. Further examination at the morphological and molecular levels showed the development of elaborate processes characteristic of neurons and the expression of genes/markers that identify different types of retinal neurons. The most prevalently expressed neural marker was calretinin, which in the chick retina identifies amacrine, ganglion, and horizontal cells. As an assay for functional maturation, the reprogrammed cells were analyzed for the presence of functional, ionotropic glutamate receptors that lead to a rise in the cytosolic free calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration. Calcium imaging showed that reprogrammed cells responded to glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) by increasing their Ca(2+) concentrations, which, after reaching a peak level, returned to the basal level. The response curves of reprogrammed cells resembled those of cultured retinal neurons. These results suggest that RPE progeny cells can be reprogrammed by ash1 to develop molecular, morphological, and physiologic properties that are characteristic of retinal neurons.
3 Managerial leadership and ischaemic heart disease among employees: the Swedish WOLF study. To investigate the association between managerial leadership and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) among employees. Data on 3122 Swedish male employees were drawn from a prospective cohort study (WOLF). Baseline screening was carried out in 1992-1995. Managerial leadership behaviours (consideration for individual employees, provision of clarity in goals and role expectations, supplying information and feedback, ability to carry out changes at work successfully, and promotion of employee participation and control) were rated by subordinates. Records of employee hospital admissions with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina and deaths from IHD or cardiac arrest to the end of 2003 were used to ascertain IHD. Cox proportional-hazards analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios for incident IHD per 1 standard deviation increase in standardised leadership score. 74 incident IHD events occurred during the mean follow-up period of 9.7 years. Higher leadership score was associated with lower IHD risk. The inverse association was stronger the longer the participant had worked in the same workplace (age-adjusted hazard ratio 0.76 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.96) for employment for 1 year, 0.77 (0.61 to 0.97) for 2 years, 0.69 (0.54 to 0.88) for 3 years, and 0.61 (0.47 to 0.80) for 4 years); this association was robust to adjustments for education, social class, income, supervisory status, perceived physical load at work, smoking, physical exercise, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, fibrinogen and diabetes. The dose-response association between perceived leadership behaviours and IHD was also evident in subsidiary analyses with only acute myocardial infarction and cardiac death as the outcome. If the observed associations were causal then workplace interventions should focus on concrete managerial behaviours in order to prevent IHD in employees.
0 Asbestos-related pleural and lung fibrosis in patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis. Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) is a rare fibroinflammatory disease that leads to hydronephrosis and renal failure. In a case-control study, we have recently shown that asbestos exposure was the most important risk factor for RPF in the Finnish population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation of asbestos exposure to radiologically confirmed lung and pleural fibrosis among patients with RPF. Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed on 16 unexposed and 22 asbestos-exposed RPF patients and 18 asbestos-exposed controls. Parietal pleural plaques (PPP), diffuse pleural thickening (DPT) and parenchymal fibrosis were scored separately. Most of the asbestos-exposed RPF patients and half of the asbestos-exposed controls had bilateral PPP, but only a few had lung fibrosis. Minor bilateral plaques were detected in two of the unexposed RPF patients, and none had lung fibrosis. DPT was most frequent and thickest in the asbestos-exposed RPF-patients. In three asbestos-exposed patients with RPF we observed exceptionally large pleural masses that were located anteriorly in the pleural space and continued into the anterior mediastinum.Asbestos exposure was associated with DPT in comparisons between RPF patients and controls (case-control analysis) as well as among RPF patients (case-case analysis). The most distinctive feature of the asbestos-exposed RPF patients was a thick DPT. An asbestos-related pleural finding was common in the asbestos-exposed RPF patients, but only a few of these patients had parenchymal lung fibrosis. RPF without asbestos exposure was not associated with pleural or lung fibrosis. The findings suggest a shared etiology for RPF and pleural fibrosis and furthermore possibly a similar pathogenetic mechanisms.
3 BMP-7 does not protect against bleomycin-induced lung or skin fibrosis. Bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-7 is a member of the BMP family which are structurally and functionally related, and part of the TGFbeta super family of growth factors. BMP-7 has been reported to inhibit renal fibrosis and TGFbeta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in part through negative interactions with TGFbeta1 induced Smad 2/3 activation. We utilized in vivo bleomycin-induced fibrosis models in the skin and lung to determine the potential therapeutic effect of BMP-7. We then determined the effect of BMP-7 on TGFbeta1-induced EMT in lung epithelial cells and collagen production by human lung fibroblasts. We show that BMP-7 did not affect bleomycin-induced fibrosis in either the lung or skin in vivo; had no effect on expression of pro-fibrotic genes by human lung fibroblasts, either at rest or following exposure to TGFbeta1; and did not modulate TGFbeta1-induced EMT in human lung epithelial cells. Taken together our data indicates that BMP-7 has no anti-fibrotic effect in lung or skin fibrosis either in vivo or in vitro. This suggests that the therapeutic options for BMP-7 may be confined to the renal compartment.
3 Role of the paracellular pathway in isotonic fluid movement across the renal tubule. Evidence for a highly permeable paracellular shunt in the proximal tubule is reviewed. The paracellular pathway is described as a crucial site for the regulation of net absorption and for solute-solvent interaction. Available models for the coupling of salt and water transport are assessed with respect to the problem of isotonic water movement. Two new models are proposed taking into account that the tight junctions are permeable to salt and water and that active transport sites for sodium are distributed uniformly along the lateral cell membrane. The first model (continuous model) is a modification of Diamond and Bossert's proposal using different assumptions and boundary conditions. No appreciable standing gradients are predicted by this model. The second model (compartmental model) is an expansion of Curran's double membrane model by including additional compartments and driving forces. Both models predict a reabsorbate which is not isosmotic. For the particular case of the proximal tubule it is shown that in the presence of a leaky epithelium these deviations from isotonicity might have escaped experimental observation.
3 Lipid rafts in T cell signalling and disease. Lipid rafts is a blanket term used to describe distinct areas in the plasma membrane rich in certain lipids and proteins and which are thought to perform diverse functions. A large number of studies report on lipid rafts having a key role in receptor signalling and activation of lymphocytes. In T cells, lipid raft involvement was demonstrated in the early steps during T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Interestingly, recent evidence has shown that signalling in these domains differs in T cells isolated from patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we discuss these findings and explore the potential of lipid rafts as targets for the development of a new class of agents to downmodulate immune responses and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
2 Imaging the neural circuitry and chemical control of aggressive motivation. With the advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in awake animals it is possible to resolve patterns of neuronal activity across the entire brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. Synchronized changes in neuronal activity across multiple brain areas can be viewed as functional neuroanatomical circuits coordinating the thoughts, memories and emotions for particular behaviors. To this end, fMRI in conscious rats combined with 3D computational analysis was used to identifying the putative distributed neural circuit involved in aggressive motivation and how this circuit is affected by drugs that block aggressive behavior. To trigger aggressive motivation, male rats were presented with their female cage mate plus a novel male intruder in the bore of the magnet during image acquisition. As expected, brain areas previously identified as critical in the organization and expression of aggressive behavior were activated, e.g., lateral hypothalamus, medial basal amygdala. Unexpected was the intense activation of the forebrain cortex and anterior thalamic nuclei. Oral administration of a selective vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist SRX251 or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, drugs that block aggressive behavior, both caused a general suppression of the distributed neural circuit involved in aggressive motivation. However, the effect of SRX251, but not fluoxetine, was specific to aggression as brain activation in response to a novel sexually receptive female was unaffected. The putative neural circuit of aggressive motivation identified with fMRI includes neural substrates contributing to emotional expression (i.e. cortical and medial amygdala, BNST, lateral hypothalamus), emotional experience (i.e. hippocampus, forebrain cortex, anterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex) and the anterior thalamic nuclei that bridge the motor and cognitive components of aggressive responding. Drugs that block vasopressin neurotransmission or enhance serotonin activity suppress activity in this putative neural circuit of aggressive motivation, particularly the anterior thalamic nuclei.
3 JAM-L-mediated leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is regulated in cis by alpha4beta1 integrin activation. Junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) are endothelial and epithelial adhesion molecules involved in the recruitment of circulating leukocytes to inflammatory sites. We show here that JAM-L, a protein related to the JAM family, is restricted to leukocytes and promotes their adhesion to endothelial cells. Cis dimerization of JAM-L is required to engage in heterophilic interactions with its cognate counter-receptor CAR (coxsackie and adenovirus receptor). Interestingly, JAM-L expressed on neutrophils binds CAR independently of integrin activation. However, on resting monocytes and T lymphocytes, which express the integrin VLA-4, JAM-L molecules engage in complexes with VLA-4 and mainly accumulate in their monomeric form. Integrin activation is required for the dissociation of JAM-L-VLA-4 complexes and the accumulation of functional JAM-L dimers, which indicates that the leukocyte integrin VLA-4 controls JAM-L function in cis by controlling its dimerization state. This provides a mechanism through which VLA-4 and JAM-L functions are coordinately regulated, allowing JAM-L to strengthen integrin-dependent adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells.
3 PSD-95 promotes synaptogenesis and multiinnervated spine formation through nitric oxide signaling. Postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) is an important regulator of synaptic structure and plasticity. However, its contribution to synapse formation and organization remains unclear. Using a combined electron microscopic, genetic, and pharmacological approach, we uncover a new mechanism through which PSD-95 regulates synaptogenesis. We find that PSD-95 overexpression affected spine morphology but also promoted the formation of multiinnervated spines (MISs) contacted by up to seven presynaptic terminals. The formation of multiple contacts was specifically prevented by deletion of the PDZ(2) domain of PSD-95, which interacts with nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS). Similarly, PSD-95 overexpression combined with small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation or the pharmacological blockade of NOS prevented axon differentiation into varicosities and multisynapse formation. Conversely, treatment of hippocampal slices with an NO donor or cyclic guanosine monophosphate analogue induced MISs. NOS blockade also reduced spine and synapse density in developing hippocampal cultures. These results indicate that the postsynaptic site, through an NOS-PSD-95 interaction and NO signaling, promotes synapse formation with nearby axons.
2 Botulinum neurotoxin devoid of receptor binding domain translocates active protease. Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) causes flaccid paralysis by disabling synaptic exocytosis. Intoxication requires the tri-modular protein to undergo conformational changes in response to pH and redox gradients across endosomes, leading to the formation of a protein-conducting channel. The approximately 50 kDa light chain (LC) protease is translocated into the cytosol by the approximately 100 kDa heavy chain (HC), which consists of two modules: the N-terminal translocation domain (TD) and the C-terminal Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). Here we exploited the BoNT modular design to identify the minimal requirements for channel activity and LC translocation in neurons. Using the combined detection of substrate proteolysis and single-channel currents, we showed that a di-modular protein consisting only of LC and TD was sufficient to translocate active protease into the cytosol of target cells. The RBD is dispensable for cell entry, channel activity, or LC translocation; however, it determined a pH threshold for channel formation. These findings indicate that, in addition to its individual functions, each module acts as a chaperone for the others, working in concert to achieve productive intoxication.
0 Reduction of Orc6 expression sensitizes human colon cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. Previous studies from our group have shown that the expression levels of Orc6 were highly elevated in colorectal cancer patient specimens and the induction of Orc6 was associated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment. The goal of this study was to investigate the molecular and cellular impact of Orc6 in colon cancer. In this study, we use HCT116 (wt-p53) and HCT116 (null-p53) colon cancer cell lines as a model system to investigate the impact of Orc6 on cell proliferation, chemosensitivity and pathways involved with Orc6. We demonstrated that the down regulation of Orc6 sensitizes colon cancer cells to both 5-FU and cisplatin (cis-pt) treatment. Decreased Orc6 expression in HCT-116 (wt-p53) cells by RNA interference triggered cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Prolonged inhibition of Orc6 expression resulted in multinucleated cells in HCT-116 (wt-p53) cell line. Western immunoblot analysis showed that down regulation of Orc6 induced p21 expression in HCT-116 (wt-p53) cells. The induction of p21 was mediated by increased level of phosphorylated p53 at ser-15. By contrast, there is no elevated expression of p21 in HCT-116 (null-p53) cells. Orc6 down regulation also increased the expression of DNA damaging repair protein GADD45beta and reduced the expression level of JNK1. Orc6 may be a potential novel target for future anti cancer therapeutic development in colon cancer.
1 Structure of a xenon derivative of Escherichia coli copper amine oxidase: confirmation of the proposed oxygen-entry pathway. The mechanism of molecular oxygen entry into the buried active site of the copper amine oxidase family has been investigated in several family members using biochemical, structural and in silico methods. These studies have revealed a structurally conserved beta-sandwich which acts as a hydrophobic reservoir from which molecular oxygen can take several species-specific preferred pathways to the active site. Escherichia coli copper amine oxidase (ECAO) possesses an extra N-terminal domain that lies close to one entrance to the beta-sandwich. In order to investigate whether the presence of this domain alters molecular oxygen entry in this enzyme, xenon was used as a molecular oxygen binding-site probe. The resulting 2.5 A resolution X-ray crystal structure reveals xenon bound in similar positions to those observed in xenon-derivative crystal structures of other family members, suggesting that the N-terminal domain does not affect oxygen entry and that the E. coli enzyme takes up oxygen in a similar manner to the rest of the copper amine oxidase family.
0 Polyamine sharing between tubulin dimers favours microtubule nucleation and elongation via facilitated diffusion. We suggest for the first time that the action of multivalent cations on microtubule dynamics can result from facilitated diffusion of GTP-tubulin to the microtubule ends. Facilitated diffusion can promote microtubule assembly, because, upon encountering a growing nucleus or the microtubule wall, random GTP-tubulin sliding on their surfaces will increase the probability of association to the target sites (nucleation sites or MT ends). This is an original explanation for understanding the apparent discrepancy between the high rate of microtubule elongation and the low rate of tubulin association at the microtubule ends in the viscous cytoplasm. The mechanism of facilitated diffusion requires an attraction force between two tubulins, which can result from the sharing of multivalent counterions. Natural polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are present in all living cells and are potent agents to trigger tubulin self-attraction. By using an analytical model, we analyze the implication of facilitated diffusion mediated by polyamines on nucleation and elongation of microtubules. In vitro experiments using pure tubulin indicate that the promotion of microtubule assembly by polyamines is typical of facilitated diffusion. The results presented here show that polyamines can be of particular importance for the regulation of the microtubule network in vivo and provide the basis for further investigations into the effects of facilitated diffusion on cytoskeleton dynamics.
1 HCV coinfection associated with slower disease progression in HIV-infected former plasma donors naïve to ART. It remains controversial how HCV coinfection influences the disease progression during HIV-1 infection. This study aims to define the influence of HCV infection on the replication of HIV-1 and the disease progression in HIV-infected former plasma donors (FPDs) naïve to ART. 168 HIV-1-infected FPDs were enrolled into a cohort study from Anhui province in central China, and thereafter monitored at month 3, 9, 15, 21 and 33. Fresh whole blood samples were used for CD4+ T-cell counting. Their plasma samples were collected and stored for quantification of HIV-1 viral loads and for determination of HCV and Toxoplasma. Out of 168 HIV-infected FBDs, 11.9% (20 cases), 80.4% (135 cases) and 7.7% (13 cases) were infected with HIV-1 alone, HIV-1/HCV and HIV/HCV/Toxoplasma, respectively. During the 33-month follow-up, only 35% (7 out of 20 cases) HIV-1 mono-infected subjects remained their CD4+ T-cell counts above 200 cells/microl and retained on the cohort study, which was significantly lower than 56% (75 out of 135 cases) for HIV/HCV group and 69% (9 out of 13 cases) for HIV/HCV/Toxoplasma group (p<0.05). CD4+ T cells in HIV mono infection group were consistently lower than that in HIV/HCV group (p = 0.04, 0.18, 0.03 and 0.04 for baseline, month 9, month 21 and month 33 visit, respectively). In accordance with those observations, HIV viral loads in HIV mono-infection group were consistently higher than that in HIV/HCV group though statistical significances were only reached at baseline (p = 0.04). These data indicated HCV coinfection with HIV-1 is associated with the slower disease progression at the very late stage when comparing with HIV-1 mono-infection. The coinfection of Toxoplasma with HIV and HCV did not exert additional influence on the disease progression. It will be highly interesting to further explore the underlying mechanism for this observation in the future.
1 Testing limits to airflow perturbation device (APD) measurements. The Airflow Perturbation Device (APD) is a lightweight, portable device that can be used to measure total respiratory resistance as well as inhalation and exhalation resistances. There is a need to determine limits to the accuracy of APD measurements for different conditions likely to occur: leaks around the mouthpiece, use of an oronasal mask, and the addition of resistance in the respiratory system. Also, there is a need for resistance measurements in patients who are ventilated. Ten subjects between the ages of 18 and 35 were tested for each station in the experiment. The first station involved testing the effects of leaks of known sizes on APD measurements. The second station tested the use of an oronasal mask used in conjunction with the APD during nose and mouth breathing. The third station tested the effects of two different resistances added in series with the APD mouthpiece. The fourth station tested the usage of a flexible ventilator tube in conjunction with the APD. All leaks reduced APD resistance measurement values. Leaks represented by two 3.2 mm diameter tubes reduced measured resistance by about 10% (4.2 cmH2O.sec/L for control and 3.9 cm H2O.sec/L for the leak). This was not statistically significant. Larger leaks given by 4.8 and 6.4 mm tubes reduced measurements significantly (3.4 and 3.0 cm cmH2O.sec/L, respectively). Mouth resistance measured with a cardboard mouthpiece gave an APD measurement of 4.2 cm H2O.sec/L and mouth resistance measured with an oronasal mask was 4.5 cm H2O.sec/L; the two were not significantly different. Nose resistance measured with the oronasal mask was 7.6 cm H2O.sec/L. Adding airflow resistances of 1.12 and 2.10 cm H2O.sec/L to the breathing circuit between the mouth and APD yielded respiratory resistance values higher than the control by 0.7 and 2.0 cm H2O.sec/L. Although breathing through a 52 cm length of flexible ventilator tubing reduced the APD measurement from 4.0 cm H2O.sec/L for the control to 3.6 cm H2O.sec/L for the tube, the difference was not statistically significant. The APD can be adapted for use in ventilated, unconscious, and uncooperative patients with use of a ventilator tube and an oronasal mask without significantly affecting measurements. Adding a resistance in series with the APD mouthpiece has an additive effect on resistance measurements, and can be used for qualitative calibration. A leak size of at least the equivalent of two 3.2 mm diameter tubes can be tolerated without significantly affecting APD measurements.
0 The association of viral activation with penicillin toxicity in guinea pigs and hamsters. PENICILLIN TOXICITY IN THE GUINEA PIG MAY BE MANIFESTED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS, AND IT IS PROPOSED THAT THESE TOXIC EFFECTS BE CATEGORIZED INTO THREE SYNDROMES: (1) toxic syndrome, characterized by acute fatal illness; (2) hemorrhagic syndrome, characterized by delayed illness with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, and culminating in massive visceral hemorrhages; (3) chronic syndrome, characterized by retardation of growth and alopecia, a condition somewhat resembling "runt disease." A virus having some of the properties of a parvovirus has been isolated repeatedly from animals ill or dying of penicillin-induced disease. This finding has been construed as being activation of a latent virus by this antibiotic, but the relationship, if any, of the phenomenon of viral activation to the syndromes produced by penicillin and its frequent lethal toxicity is unknown. That a strong association exists, however, has been established. Of some 60 guinea pigs which received injections of penicillin three developed tumors and four others were found to have gallstones. A virus similar or identical to the guinea pig virus also has been isolated from hamsters dying of penicillin-induced disease. It is hypothesized that the absorption of endotoxin, resulting from the well known change in intestinal flora caused by penicillin, produces a state of immunodeficiency which regularly gives rise to activation of a latent virus, and perhaps, rarely, to the development of malignant neoplasms.
0 Prism adaptation aftereffects in stroke patients with spatial neglect: pathological effects on subjective straight ahead but not visual open-loop pointing. Prism adaptation to rightward optical shifts during visually guided pointing is considered a promising intervention in right-hemisphere stroke patients with left spatial neglect. Conventionally, prism adaptation is assessed via aftereffects, on subjective straight ahead (SSA) pointing with eyes closed; or by visual open-loop pointing (VOL), i.e. pointing to a visual target without seeing the hand. Previous data suggest indirectly that prism aftereffects in neglect patients may be larger (pathologically so) when assessed by SSA than by VOL. But these measures have never been directly compared within the same patients after identical prism exposure. Accordingly we implemented both measures here within the same group of 13 neglect patients and 13 controls. Prism aftereffects were much larger for SSA than VOL in neglect patients, falling outside the normative range only for SSA. This may arise because the SSA task can itself involve aspects of neglect that may be ameliorated by the prism intervention, hence showing abnormal changes after prisms. The extent of SSA change after prisms varied between patients, and correlated with improvements on a standard cancellation measure for neglect. The lesions of patients who did versus did not show neglect improvement immediately after prisms provide an initial indication that lack of improvement may potentially relate to cortical damage in right intraparietal sulcus and white matter damage in inferior parietal lobe and middle frontal gyrus. Future studies of possible rehabilitative impact from prisms upon neglect may need to consider carefully how to measure prism adaptation per se, separately from any impact of such adaptation upon manifestations of neglect.
0 Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pak-related protein, Pak1p/Orb2p, phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain to inhibit cytokinesis. p21-activated kinases (Paks) have been identified in a variety of eukaryotic cells as key effectors of the Cdc42 family of guanosine triphosphatases. Pak kinases play important roles in regulating the filamentous actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we describe a function for the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pak-related protein Pak1p/Orb2p in cytokinesis. Pak1p localizes to the actomyosin ring during mitosis and cytokinesis. Loss of Pak1p function leads to accelerated cytokinesis. Pak1p mediates phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain Rlc1p at serine residues 35 and 36 in vivo. Interestingly, loss of Pak1p function or substitution of serine 35 and serine 36 of Rlc1p with alanines, thereby mimicking a dephosphorylated state of Rlc1p, leads to defective coordination of mitosis and cytokinesis. This study reveals a new mechanism involving Pak1p kinase that helps ensure the fidelity of cytokinesis.
0 Occurrence and clinical relevance of Mycobacterium chimaera sp. nov., Germany. Retrospective molecular genetic analysis of 166 Mycobacterium intracellulare isolates showed that 143 (86%) strains could be assigned to Mycobacterium chimaera sp. nov. Of 97 patients from whom M. chimaera sp. nov. was isolated, only 3.3% exhibited mycobacterial lung disease, whereas all M. intracellulare isolates caused severe pulmonary infections.
0 Pathogenesis of neonatal group B streptococcal infections. Infections of the neonate due to the group B Streptococcus have been recognized since the 1930s, but it was during the 1970s that their incidence grew alarmingly throughout the world. A research effort stimulated by this problem has yielded significant new information about many facets of the pathogenesis of these infections. Immunologic investigations have pinpointed a lack of transplacentally acquired antibody as a significant risk factor. In the laboratory, assays of antibody which have a functional endpoint have demonstrated that the type-specific carbohydrate antigens play a major role in stimulating the development of protective antibody. These assays have been shown to correlate with certain tests of primary antigen-antibody interaction which do not have a functional endpoint, but are simpler to use in larger scale epidemiologic studies. These tools may be useful in filling the gaps in our current knowledge of the pathogenesis of this infection.
0 Evaluating the reliability, validity and minimally important difference of the Taiwanese version of the diabetes quality of life (DQOL) measurement. Few diabetes HRQOL instruments are available in Chinese language. We tested psychometric properties of a Diabetes Quality of Life (DQOL) in Chinese language for diabetes patients in Taiwan and estimated its minimally important differences (MIDs). Data were collected from 337 patients treated in diabetes clinics of a Taiwan teaching hospital. Pearson's correlations among domain scores of the DQOL (satisfaction, impact, and worry), the D-39S (a diabetes-specific instrument, including domains of diabetes control, energy and mobility, social burden and anxiety and worry, and sexual functioning) and the RAND-12 (a generic instrument, including physical health composite (PHC) and mental health composite (MHC)) were estimated to determine convergent/discriminant validity. Known-groups validity was examined using 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2 h PPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) and presence of complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, and diabetic foot complications rather than the known groups of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications). We used a combined anchor- and distribution-based approach to establish MIDs. The DQOL scores were more strongly correlated with the physical domains of the D-39S (diabetes control and energy and mobility) and RAND-12 PHC than psychological domains of the D-39S (social burden, anxiety and worry, and sexual functioning) and RAND-12 MHC. The DQOL showed satisfactory discriminative ability for the known groups of 2 h PPG and HbA1c (effect size (ES) > or = 0.2) and retinopathy, neuropathy, and diabetic foot complications (ES > or = 0.3), but less satisfactory for the known groups of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. MIDs for the DQOL domains were 3-5 points for satisfaction, 4-5 points for impact, 6-8 points for worry, and 3-4 points for overall HRQOL. We validated a DQOL in Chinese language for diabetes patients in Taiwan and provided MIDs to facilitate the measure of diabetes HRQOL.
0 Lack of association between sCTLA-4 levels in human plasma and common CTLA-4 polymorphisms. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is an important downregulatory molecule expressed on both T and B lymphocytes. Numerous population genetics studies have documented significant associations between autoimmune diseases and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and around the CTLA-4 region of chromosome 2 in man. Furthermore, circulating levels of a soluble form of CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) have been reported in a variety of autoimmune mediated diseases. Despite these findings, the relationship between levels of sCTLA-4 protein, mRNA transcript levels, and SNPs within the CTLA-4 region have not been clearly defined. In order to further clarify this relationship, we have tested four different SNPs within the CTLA-4 region among subjects whom are negative (n = 53) versus positive (n = 28) for sCTLA-4. Our data do not support a clear association between sCTLA-4 levels and any of the four SNPs tested. The variation in the SNPs tested does not appear to effect sCTLA-4 protein levels, despite reports that they affect sCTLA-4 mRNA.
3 The effect of corticosteroids on dendritic development in the rat brain. Sprague-Dawley rats were given 0.02 ml of methylprednisolone (0.06 g/g body wt) 6, 9, or 12 days postnatally. When compared with saline-treated controls, the following effects on dendritic development in layers 3 and 5 of the parietal cortex were observed: (1) no significant alteration in number of basal dendrites; (2) initial increase (at 3 wk of age) in branchings near the perikaryon in the group treated at 12 days; (3) decrease in number of branches at distances ≥270 μm from the perikaryon in layers 3 and 5 in all steroid-treated groups when sacrificed at 6 wk; (4) decrease in number of intersections in layer 5 in all steroid-treated groups when sacrificed at 6 wk; and (5) decrease in number of terminations in layers 3 and 5 in all steroid-treated groups when sacrificed at 6 wk.
0 The effects of functional adaptation of residual nephrons on the urinary excretion of drugs. In patients with chronic renal failure due to glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis or polycystic kidneys the urinary clearance of free chloramphenicol (C(CHL)) was depressed proportionally to GFR (C(In)). The ordinate intercept of the regression line of C(CHL) on C(In), however, consistently was positive (+3 to +5 ml/min). The fractional excretion of chloramphenicol in renal failure increased from its normal value of 50 percent as an exponential function of the decrease of GFR, and as a linear function of the fractional excretion of water or of sodium. Dietary sodium restriction had no influence on C(CHL) in the patients, while water diuresis, in normal subjects, enhanced the urinary excretion of chloramphenicol. The data suggest that chloramphenicol is reabsorbed by back-diffusion and that increases of the rate of flow of urine and tubular fluid prevent back-diffusion.
0 Ion channel clustering at the axon initial segment and node of Ranvier evolved sequentially in early chordates. In many mammalian neurons, dense clusters of ion channels at the axonal initial segment and nodes of Ranvier underlie action potential generation and rapid conduction. Axonal clustering of mammalian voltage-gated sodium and KCNQ (Kv7) potassium channels is based on linkage to the actin-spectrin cytoskeleton, which is mediated by the adaptor protein ankyrin-G. We identified key steps in the evolution of this axonal channel clustering. The anchor motif for sodium channel clustering evolved early in the chordate lineage before the divergence of the wormlike cephalochordate, amphioxus. Axons of the lamprey, a very primitive vertebrate, exhibited some invertebrate features (lack of myelin, use of giant diameter to hasten conduction), but possessed narrow initial segments bearing sodium channel clusters like in more recently evolved vertebrates. The KCNQ potassium channel anchor motif evolved after the divergence of lampreys from other vertebrates, in a common ancestor of shark and humans. Thus, clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels was a pivotal early innovation of the chordates. Sodium channel clusters at the axon initial segment serving the generation of action potentials evolved long before the node of Ranvier. KCNQ channels acquired anchors allowing their integration into pre-existing sodium channel complexes at about the same time that ancient vertebrates acquired myelin, saltatory conduction, and hinged jaws. The early chordate refinements in action potential mechanisms we have elucidated appear essential to the complex neural signaling, active behavior, and evolutionary success of vertebrates.
1 Inducing cross-clade neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 by immunofocusing. Although vaccines are important in preventing viral infections by inducing neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), HIV-1 has proven to be a difficult target and escapes humoral immunity through various mechanisms. We sought to test whether HIV-1 Env mimics may serve as immunogens. Using random peptide phage display libraries, we identified the epitopes recognized by polyclonal antibodies of a rhesus monkey that had developed high-titer, broadly reactive nAbs after infection with a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) encoding env of a recently transmitted HIV-1 clade C (HIV-C). Phage peptide inserts were analyzed for conformational and linear homology using computational analysis; some peptides mimicked various domains of the original HIV-C Env, such as conformational V3 loop epitopes and the conserved linear region of the gp120 C-terminus. Next, we devised a novel prime/boost strategy to test the immunogenicity of such phage-displayed peptides and primed mice only once with HIV-C gp160 DNA followed by boosting with mixtures of recombinant phages. This strategy, which was designed to focus the immune system on a few Env epitopes (immunofocusing), not only induced HIV-C gp160 binding antibodies and cross-clade nAbs, but also linked a conserved HIV Env region for the first time to the induction of nAbs: the C-terminus of gp120. The identification of conserved antigen mimics may lead to novel immunogens capable of inducing broadly reactive nAbs.
1 Expression of the zinc-finger transcription factor Snail in adrenocortical carcinoma is associated with decreased survival. In this study, we evaluate whether Snail is expressed in adrenocortical cancer (ACC) and if its expression is related to patient outcome. One of the best known functions of the zinc-finger transcription factor Snail is to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Increasing evidence suggests that EMT plays a pivotal role in tumour progression and metastatic spread. Snail and E-cadherin expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 26 resected ACCs and real-time quantitative RT-PCR expression analysis was performed. Data were correlated with clinical outcome and in particular with overall patient survival. Seventeen of 26 (65%) ACC tumour samples expressed Snail when assessed by immunohistochemistry. Snail expression was neither detected in normal adrenocortical tissue, nor in benign adrenocortical adenomas. Expression levels were confirmed on the mRNA level by Real-Time-PCR. Survival rates were significantly decreased in Snail-positive tumours compared to Snail-negative tumours: 10 out of 16 vs one out of eight patients succumbed to disease after a median follow up of 14.5 and 28.5 months, respectively (P=0.03). Patients with Snail-expressing ACCs presented in advanced disease (11 out of 12 vs 6 out of 14, P=0.01) and tend to develop distant metastases more frequently than patients with negative staining (7 out of 11 vs two out of eight, P=0.19). In conclusion, we describe for the first time that Snail is expressed in a large subset of ACCs. Furthermore, Snail expression is associated with decreased survival, advanced disease and higher risk of developing distant metastases.
1 Statistical significance of precisely repeated intracellular synaptic patterns. Can neuronal networks produce patterns of activity with millisecond accuracy? It may seem unlikely, considering the probabilistic nature of synaptic transmission. However, some theories of brain function predict that such precision is feasible and can emerge from the non-linearity of the action potential generation in circuits of connected neurons. Several studies have presented evidence for and against this hypothesis. Our earlier work supported the precision hypothesis, based on results demonstrating that precise patterns of synaptic inputs could be found in intracellular recordings from neurons in brain slices and in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we devised a method for finding precise repeats of activity and compared repeats found in the data to those found in surrogate datasets made by shuffling the original data. Because more repeats were found in the original data than in the surrogate data sets, we argued that repeats were not due to chance occurrence. Mokeichev et al. (2007) challenged these conclusions, arguing that the generation of surrogate data was insufficiently rigorous. We have now reanalyzed our previous data with the methods introduced from Mokeichev et al. (2007). Our reanalysis reveals that repeats are statistically significant, thus supporting our earlier conclusions, while also supporting many conclusions that Mokeichev et al. (2007) drew from their recent in vivo recordings. Moreover, we also show that the conditions under which the membrane potential is recorded contributes significantly to the ability to detect repeats and may explain conflicting results. In conclusion, our reevaluation resolves the methodological contradictions between Ikegaya et al. (2004) and Mokeichev et al. (2007), but demonstrates the validity of our previous conclusion that spontaneous network activity is non-randomly organized.
3 Epididymal sarcoidosis: a report of two cases and a review of the literature. Two cases of epididymal sarcoidosis, presenting as scrotal masses, are described. Biopsies of the epididymis and scalene nodes established the diagnosis. The literature of epididymal sarcoid and its differential diagnosis is discussed.
1 In vitro analysis of expression vectors for DNA vaccination of horses: the effect of a Kozak sequence. One of the prerequisite for developing DNA vaccines for horses are vectors that are efficiently expressed in horse cells. We have analysed the ectopic expression of the human serum albumin gene in primary horse cells from different tissues. The vectors used are of pcDNA and pUC origin and include the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The pUC vectors contain CMV intron A whereas the pcDNA vectors do not. Insertion of intron A diminished the expression from the pcDNA vectors whereas insertion of a Kozak sequence upstream of the gene in two types of pUC vectors increased significantly the in vitro expression in primary horse cells derived from skin, lung, duodenum and kidney. We report for the first time the significance of full consensus Kozak sequences for protein expression in horse cells in vitro.
1 Wild bird influenza survey, Canada, 2005. Of 4,268 wild ducks sampled in Canada in 2005, real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR detected influenza A matrix protein (M1) gene sequence in 37% and H5 gene sequence in 5%. Mallards accounted for 61% of samples, 73% of M1-positive ducks, and 90% of H5-positive ducks. Ducks hatched in 2005 accounted for 80% of the sample.
2 Control of meningococcal meningitis with meningococcal vaccines. The development of effective meinigococcal vaccines was based upon the finding that immunity to the meningococcus was directly correlated with serum bactericidal antibodies. Purified high molecular weight capsular polysaccharides of serogroups A and C meningococci stimulated the production of humoral antibodies which had group specific bactericidal activity. In controlled field trials in Army recruits, group C polysaccharide vaccines were highly effective in preventing group C disease. Following its use as a routine immunization in recruits in October 1971 group C meningococcal disease has been almost completely eliminated from Army training centers. Group A vaccine has been field tested in Egyptian school children with great success. Group B polysaccharide has failed to induce bactericidal antibodies in humans and, therefore, new research is underway to attempt to develop a cell wall protein antigen as a vaccine against group B disease.
0 Immune regulation of bone loss by Th17 cells. A significant macrophage and T-cell infiltrate commonly occurs in inflammatory joint conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis that have significant bone destruction. Cytokines produced by activated macrophages and T cells are implicated in arthritis pathogenesis and are involved in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The scope of the present review is to analyze current knowledge and to provide a better understanding of how macrophage-derived factors promote the differentiation of a novel T-helper subset (Th17) that promotes osteoclast formation and activation.
3 Characterization of Mce4A protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: role in invasion and survival. The mce4 operon is one of the four homologues of mammalian cell entry (mce) operons of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The mce4A (Rv3499c) gene within this operon is homologous to mce1A (Rv0169), that has a role in host cell invasion by M. tuberculosis. Our earlier reports show that mce4 operon is expressed during the stationary phase of growth of the bacillus in culture and during the course of infection in mammalian hosts. M. tuberculosis carrying mutation in mce4 operon shows growth defect and reduced survival in infected mice. However, the intracellular localization of Mce4A protein and its direct role in cell entry or survival of the bacillus has not been demonstrated so far. By transmission electron microscopy we have demonstrated that recombinant Mce4A protein facilitates the invasion of non-pathogenic strain of E. coli into non-phagocytic HeLa cells. We observe that mce4A gene has a role comparable to mce1A in the survival of recombinant E. coli in human macrophages. Using antibodies raised against Mce4A protein, we show that the protein is localized in the cell wall fraction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv stationary phase culture only. Mce4A protein is expressed during the stationary phase of broth culture and localizes in the cell wall fraction of M. tuberculosis. Mce4A protein expressed in non-pathogenic E. coli enables it to enter and survive within HeLa cells and the macrophages. As Mce4A protein is expressed during later phase of mycobacterial growth, our results raise the possibility of it playing a role in maintenance of persistent tubercular infection.
0 Experimental conditions affect the outcome of Plasmodium falciparum platelet-mediated clumping assays. Platelet-mediated clumping of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) is a parasite adhesion phenotype that has been associated with severe malaria in some, but not all, field isolate studies. A variety of experimental conditions have been used to study clumping in vitro, with substantial differences in parasitaemia (Pt), haematocrit (Ht), and time of reaction between studies. It is unknown whether these experimental variables affect the outcome of parasite clumping assays. The effects of Pt (1, 4 and 12%), Ht (2, 5 and 10%) and time (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h) on the clumping of P. falciparum clone HB3 were examined. The effects of platelet freshness and parasite maturity were also studied. At low Ht (2%), the Pt of the culture has a large effect on clumping, with significantly higher clumping occurring at 12% Pt (mean 47% of IE in clumps) compared to 4% Pt (mean 26% IE in clumps) or 1% Pt (mean 7% IE in clumps) (ANOVA, p=0.0004). Similarly, at low Pt (1%), the Ht of the culture has a large effect on clumping, with significantly higher clumping occurring at 10% Ht (mean 62% IE in clumps) compared to 5% Ht (mean 25% IE in clumps) or 2% Ht (mean 10% IE in clumps) (ANOVA, p=0.0004). Combinations of high Ht and high Pt were impractical because of the difficulty assessing clumping in densely packed IE and the rapid formation of enormous clumps that could not be counted accurately. There was no significant difference in clumping when fresh platelets were used compared to platelets stored at 4 degrees C for 10 days. Clumping was a property of mature pigmented-trophozoites and schizonts but not ring stage parasites. The Pt and Ht at which in vitro clumping assays are set up have a profound effect on the outcome. All previous field isolate studies on clumping and malaria severity suffer from potential problems in experimental design and methodology. Future studies of clumping should use standardized conditions and control for Pt, and should take into account the limitations and variability inherent in the assay.
3 Human Infections with Plasmodium knowlesi, the Philippines. Five human cases of infection with the simian malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi from Palawan, the Philippines, were confirmed by nested PCR. This study suggests that this zoonotic infection is found across a relatively wide area in Palawan and documents autochthonous cases in the country.
0 Reduced basal ATP synthetic flux of skeletal muscle in patients with previous acromegaly. Impaired mitochondrial function and ectopic lipid deposition in skeletal muscle and liver have been linked to decreased insulin sensitivity. As growth hormone (GH) excess can reduce insulin sensitivity, we examined the impact of previous acromegaly (AM) on glucose metabolism, lipid storage and muscular ATP turnover. Seven AM (4f/3 m, age: 46+/-4 years, BMI: 28+/-1 kg/m(2)) and healthy volunteers (CON: 3f/4 m, 43+/-4 years, 26+/-2 kg/m(2)) matched for age and body mass underwent oral glucose testing for assessment of insulin sensitivity (OGIS) and ss-cell function (adaptation index, ADAP). Whole body oxidative capacity was measured with indirect calorimetry and spiroergometry. Unidirectional ATP synthetic flux (fATP) was assessed from (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of calf muscle. Lipid contents of tibialis anterior (IMCLt) and soleus muscles (IMCLs) and liver (HCL) were measured with (1)H MRS. Despite comparable GH, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) and insulin sensitivity, AM had approximately 85% lower ADAP (p<0.01) and approximately 21% reduced VO(2)max (p<0.05). fATP was similarly approximately 25% lower in AM (p<0.05) and related positively to ADAP (r = 0.744, p<0.01), but negatively to BMI (r = -0.582, p<0.05). AM had approximately 3 fold higher HCL (p<0.05) while IMCLt and IMCLs did not differ between the groups. Humans with a history of acromegaly exhibit reduced insulin secretion, muscular ATP synthesis and oxidative capacity but elevated liver fat content. This suggests that alterations in ss-cell function and myocellular ATP production may persist despite normalization of GH secretion after successful treatment of acromegaly.
3 Epstein-Barr virus in cerebrospinal fluid during infectious mononucleosis encephalitis. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was recovered from cerebrospinal cells (but not from cell-free fluid) of a patient with meningoencephalitis complicating infectious mononucleosis. This finding suggests that virus-altered B lymphocytes can invade the central nervous system and may play a direct role in the pathogenesis of neurologic sequelae of EBV infections. Several mechanisms by which these cells can cause neurologic manifestations are discussed.
0 Characterization of the repertoire diversity of the Plasmodium falciparum stevor multigene family in laboratory and field isolates. The evasion of host immune response by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has been linked to expression of a range of variable antigens on the infected erythrocyte surface. Several genes are potentially involved in this process with the var, rif and stevor multigene families being the most likely candidates and coding for rapidly evolving proteins. The high sequence diversity of proteins encoded by these gene families may have evolved as an immune evasion strategy that enables the parasite to establish long lasting chronic infections. Previous findings have shown that the hypervariable region (HVR) of STEVOR has significant sequence diversity both within as well as across different P. falciparum lines. However, these studies did not address whether or not there are ancestral stevor that can be found in different parasites. DNA and RNA sequences analysis as well as phylogenetic approaches were used to analyse the stevor sequence repertoire and diversity in laboratory lines and Kilifi (Kenya) fresh isolates. Conserved stevor genes were identified in different P. falciparum isolates from different global locations. Consistent with previous studies, the HVR of the stevor gene family was found to be highly divergent both within and between isolates. Importantly phylogenetic analysis shows some clustering of stevor sequences both within a single parasite clone as well as across different parasite isolates. This indicates that the ancestral P. falciparum parasite genome already contained multiple stevor genes that have subsequently diversified further within the different P. falciparum populations. It also confirms that STEVOR is under strong selection pressure.
2 Parental knowledge of paediatric vaccination. Although routine vaccination is a major tool in the primary prevention of some infectious diseases, there is some reluctance in a proportion of the population. Negative parental perceptions of vaccination are an important barrier to paediatric vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate parental knowledge of paediatric vaccines and vaccination in Catalonia. A retrospective, cross-sectional study was carried out in children aged < 3 years recruited by random sampling from municipal districts of all health regions of Catalonia. The total sample was 630 children. Parents completed a standard questionnaire for each child, which included vaccination coverage and knowledge about vaccination. The level of knowledge of vaccination was scored according to parental answers. An association was observed between greater vaccination coverage of the 4:4:4:3:1 schedule (defined as: 4 DTPa/w doses, 4 Hib doses, 4 OPV doses, 3 MenC doses and 1 MMR dose) and maternal age >30 years (OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.20-4.43) and with a knowledge of vaccination score greater than the mean (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.28-0.72). The score increased with maternal educational level and in parents of vaccinated children.A total of 20.47% of parents stated that vaccines could have undesirable consequences for their children. Of these, 23.26% had no specific information and 17.83% stated that vaccines can cause adverse reactions and the same percentage stated that vaccines cause allergies and asthma. Higher vaccination coverage is associated with older maternal age and greater knowledge of vaccination.Vaccination coverage could be raised by improving information on vaccines and vaccination.
0 Explaining lengths and shapes of yeast by scaling arguments. Lengths and shapes are approached in different ways in different fields: they serve as a read-out for classifying genes or proteins in cell biology whereas they result from scaling arguments in condensed matter physics. Here, we propose a combined approach with examples illustrated for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
3 Predicting EuroQol (EQ-5D) scores from the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) global items and domain item banks in a United States sample. Preference-based health index scores provide a single summary score assessing overall health-related quality of life and are useful as an outcome measure in clinical studies, for estimating quality-adjusted life years for economic evaluations, and for monitoring the health of populations. We predicted EuroQoL (EQ-5D) index scores from patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) global items and domain item banks. This was a secondary analysis of health outcome data collected in an internet survey as part of the PROMIS Wave 1 field testing. For this study, we included the 10 global items and the physical function, fatigue, pain impact, anxiety, and depression item banks. Linear regression analyses were used to predict EQ-5D index scores based on the global items and selected domain banks. The regression models using eight of the PROMIS global items (quality of life, physical activities, mental health, emotional problems, social activities, pain, and fatigue and either general health or physical health items) explained 65% of the variance in the EQ-5D. When the PROMIS domain scores were included in a regression model, 57% of the variance was explained in EQ-5D scores. Comparisons of predicted to actual EQ-5D scores by age and gender groups showed that they were similar. EQ-5D preference scores can be predicted accurately from either the PROMIS global items or selected domain banks. Application of the derived regression model allows the estimation of health preference scores from the PROMIS health measures for use in economic evaluations.
3 The joint influence of area income, income inequality, and immigrant density on adverse birth outcomes: a population-based study. The association between area characteristics and birth outcomes is modified by race. Whether such associations vary according to social class indicators beyond race has not been assessed. This study evaluated effect modification by maternal birthplace and education of the relationship between neighbourhood characteristics and birth outcomes of newborns from 1999-2003 in the province of Québec, Canada (N = 353,120 births). Areas (N = 143) were defined as administrative local health service delivery districts. Multi-level logistic regression was used to model the association between three area characteristics (median household income, immigrant density and income inequality) and the two outcomes preterm birth (PTB) and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. Effect modification by social class indicators was evaluated in analyses stratified according to maternal birthplace and education. Relative to the lowest tertile, high median household income was associated with SGA birth among Canadian-born mothers (odds ratio (OR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06, 1.20) and mothers with high school education or less (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02, 1.24). Associations between median household income and PTB were weaker. Relative to the highest tertile, low immigrant density was associated with a lower odds of PTB among foreign-born mothers (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63, 1.00) but a higher odds of PTB among Canadian-born mothers (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07, 1.21). Associations with income inequality were weak or absent. The association between area factors and birth outcomes is modified by maternal birthplace and education. Studies have found that race interacts in a similar manner. Public health policies focussed on perinatal health must consider the interaction between individual and area characteristics.
0 Rv2131c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a CysQ 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphatase. Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb) produces a number of sulfur-containing metabolites that contribute to its pathogenesis and ability to survive in the host. These metabolites are products of the sulfate assimilation pathway. CysQ, a 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphatase, is considered an important regulator of this pathway in plants, yeast, and other bacteria. By controlling the pools of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), CysQ has the potential to modulate flux in the biosynthesis of essential sulfur-containing metabolites. Bioinformatic analysis of the Mtb genome suggests the presence of a CysQ homologue encoded by the gene Rv2131c. However, a recent biochemical study assigned the protein's function as a class IV fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. In the present study, we expressed Rv2131c heterologously and found that the protein dephosphorylates PAP in a magnesium-dependent manner, with optimal activity observed between pH 8.5 and pH 9.5 using 0.5 mM MgCl 2. A sensitive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry-based assay was used to extract the kinetic parameters for PAP, revealing a K m (8.1 +/- 3.1 microM) and k cat (5.4 +/- 1.1 s (-1)) comparable to those reported for other CysQ enzymes. The second-order rate constant for PAP was determined to be over 3 orders of magnitude greater than those determined for myo-inositol 1-phosphate (IMP) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), previously considered to be the primary substrates of this enzyme. Moreover, the ability of the Rv2131c-encoded enzyme to dephosphorylate PAP and PAPS in vivo was confirmed by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli Delta cysQ mutant. Taken together, these studies indicate that Rv2131c encodes a CysQ enzyme that may play a role in mycobacterial sulfur metabolism.
1 Detailed dissection of the chromosomal region containing the Ph1 locus in wheat Triticum aestivum: with deletion mutants and expression profiling. Understanding Ph1, a dominant homoeologous chromosome pairing suppressor locus on the long arm of chromosome 5B in wheat Triticum aestivum L., is the core of the investigation in this article. The Ph1 locus restricts chromosome pairing and recombination at meiosis to true homologues. The importance of wheat as a crop and the need to exploit its wild relatives as donors for economically important traits in wheat breeding programmes is the main drive to uncover the mechanism of the Ph1 locus and regulate its activity. Following the molecular genetic characterization of the Ph1 locus, five additional deletion mutants covering the region have been identified. In addition, more bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) were sequenced and analysed to elucidate the complexity of this locus. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to compare the expression profiles of different genes in the 5B region containing the Ph1 locus with their homoeologues on 5A and 5D. PCR products were cloned and sequenced to identify the gene from which they were derived. Deletion mutants and expression profiling of genes in the region containing the Ph1 locus on 5B has further restricted Ph1 to a cluster of cdk-like genes. Bioinformatic analysis of the cdk-like genes revealed their close homology to the checkpoint kinase Cdk2 from humans. Cdk2 is involved in the initiation of replication and is required in early meiosis. Expression profiling has revealed that the cdk-like gene cluster is unique within the region analysed on 5B in that these genes are transcribed. Deletion of the cdk-like locus on 5B results in activation of transcription of functional cdk-like copies on 5A and 5D. Thus the cdk locus on 5B is dominant to those on 5A and 5D in determining the overall activity, which will be dependent on a complex interplay between transcription from non-functional and functional cdk-like genes. The Ph1 locus has been defined to a cdk-like gene cluster related to Cdk2 in humans, a master checkpoint gene involved in the initiation of replication and required for early meiosis.
1 The subaortic tendon as a mimic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Originally described by Brock and Teare, today hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is clinically defined as left (or right) ventricular hypertrophy without a known cardiac or systemic cause, such as systemic hypertension, Fabry's disease or aortic stenosis.Also appreciated today is the enormous genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of this disease with more than 300 mutations over more than 24 genes, encoding various sarcomeric, mitochondrial and calcium-handling proteins, all as genetic causes for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Phenotypically, the disease can vary from negligible to extreme hypertrophy, affecting either the left and/or right ventricle in an apical, midventricular or subaortic location.Left ventricular false tendons are thin, fibrous or fibromuscular structures that traverse the left ventricular cavity. Recently, a case report was presented where it was shown that such a false tendon, originating from a subaortic location, was responsible for striking ST-segment elevation on the surface electrocardiogram.In this case report, a case is presented where such a subaortic tendon led to the classic echocardiographic appearance of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, thus in the assessment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, this entity needs to be excluded in order to prevent a false positive diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
1 Quantitative detection of myocardial ischaemia by stress echocardiography; a comparison with SPECT. Real-time perfusion (RTP) adenosine stress echocardiography (ASE) can be used to visually evaluate myocardial ischaemia. The RTP power modulation technique angio-mode (AM), provides images for off-line perfusion quantification using Qontrast software, generating values of peak signal intensity (A), myocardial blood flow velocity (beta) and myocardial blood flow (Axbeta). By comparing rest and stress values, their respective reserve values (A-r, beta-r, Axbeta-r) are generated. We evaluated myocardial ischaemia by RTP-ASE Qontrast quantification, compared to visual perfusion evaluation with 99mTc-tetrofosmin single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Patients admitted to SPECT underwent RTP-ASE (SONOS 5500) using AM during Sonovue infusion, before and throughout adenosine stress, also used for SPECT. Visual myocardial perfusion and wall motion analysis, and Qontrast quantification, were blindly compared to one another and to SPECT, at different time points off-line.We analyzed 201 coronary territories (left anterior descendent [LAD], left circumflex [LCx] and right coronary [RCA] artery territories) in 67 patients. SPECT showed ischaemia in 18 patients and 19 territories. Receiver operator characteristics and kappa values showed significant agreement with SPECT only for beta-r and Axbeta-r in all segments: area under the curve 0.678 and 0.665; P < 0.001 and < 0.01, respectively. The closest agreements were seen in the LAD territory: kappa 0.442 for both beta-r and Axbeta-r; P < 0.01. Visual evaluation of ischaemia showed good agreement with SPECT: accuracy 93%; kappa 0.67; P < 0.001; without non-interpretable territories. In this agreement study with SPECT, RTP-ASE Qontrast quantification of myocardial ischaemia was less accurate and less feasible than visual evaluation and needs further development to be clinically useful.
1 Hepatic metastasis from choriocarcinoma: angiographic findings in two cases. We report two cases of hepatic metastases from choriocarcinoma in women of childbearing age in whom imaging studies performed at presentation revealed the presence of liver masses, and who had clinically progressive anemia or intraabdominal hemorrhage. CT demonstrated heterogeneously enhanced liver masses. Characteristic angiographic findings included hypervascular hepatic masses with aneurysmal dilatations of the peripheral hepatic arteries at the arterial phase and persistent vascular lakes at the venous phase.
3 A novel mechanism of hippocampal LTD involving muscarinic receptor-triggered interactions between AMPARs, GRIP and liprin-alpha. Long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus can be induced by activation of different types of G-protein coupled receptors, in particular metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Since mGluRs and mAChRs activate the same G-proteins and isoforms of phospholipase C (PLC), it would be expected that these two forms of LTD utilise the same molecular mechanisms. However, we find a distinct mechanism of LTD involving GRIP and liprin-alpha. Whilst both forms of LTD require activation of tyrosine phosphatases and involve internalisation of AMPARs, they use different molecular interactions. Specifically, mAChR-LTD, but not mGluR-LTD, is blocked by peptides that inhibit the binding of GRIP to the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 and the binding of GRIP to liprin-alpha. Thus, different receptors that utilise the same G-proteins can regulate AMPAR trafficking and synaptic efficacy via distinct molecular mechanisms. Our results suggest that mAChR-LTD selectively involves interactions between GRIP and liprin-alpha. These data indicate a novel mechanism of synaptic plasticity in which activation of M1 receptors results in AMPAR endocytosis, via a mechanism involving interactions between GluA2, GRIP and liprin-alpha.
1 Clear-cell meningioma: CT and MR imaging findings in two cases involving the spinal canal and cerebellopontine angle. Clear-cell meningioma is a rare subtype of meningioma which occurs at a younger age and has a higher recurrence rate than other subtypes. We report two cases of clear-cell meningioma, one in the thoracolumbar spinal canal and the other in the cerebellopontine angle. Though the CT and MR imaging findings were not different from those of ordinary meningioma, after surgical removal the condition recurred repeatedly in the patient with spinal canal involvement.
1 designGG: an R-package and web tool for the optimal design of genetical genomics experiments. High-dimensional biomolecular profiling of genetically different individuals in one or more environmental conditions is an increasingly popular strategy for exploring the functioning of complex biological systems. The optimal design of such genetical genomics experiments in a cost-efficient and effective way is not trivial. This paper presents designGG, an R package for designing optimal genetical genomics experiments. A web implementation for designGG is available at http://gbic.biol.rug.nl/designGG. All software, including source code and documentation, is freely available. DesignGG allows users to intelligently select and allocate individuals to experimental units and conditions such as drug treatment. The user can maximize the power and resolution of detecting genetic, environmental and interaction effects in a genome-wide or local mode by giving more weight to genome regions of special interest, such as previously detected phenotypic quantitative trait loci. This will help to achieve high power and more accurate estimates of the effects of interesting factors, and thus yield a more reliable biological interpretation of data. DesignGG is applicable to linkage analysis of experimental crosses, e.g. recombinant inbred lines, as well as to association analysis of natural populations.
3 Cytometric detection of antigen-specific IFN-gamma/IL-2 secreting cells in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The purpose of this study was to further characterize the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigens, in order to provide new insight into host-pathogen interactions in tuberculosis (TB), and to offer tools for a more accurate diagnosis of the different stages of TB. T-cell responses to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), purified protein derivative (PPD), early secretory antigenic target-6 (ESAT-6) protein and culture filtrate protein-10 kDa (CFP-10) were measured in terms of interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2 release, using a novel flow cytometric cell-secreting cytokine detection technique. The study was conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from active TB patients, latently TB infected individuals, and healthy donors. IL-10 and IL-17 were also measured to test their possible role as indicators of disease activity. We confirmed that the enumeration of IFN-gamma releasing cells upon Mtb-specific stimulation is sufficient to identify TB patients and that CD8+ T cells concur to IFN-gamma secretion. IL-2 secreting cells were more frequently observed in latent TB infected individuals compared to active TB patients, suggesting that measurement of cells secreting this cytokine could be a marker of disease stage. No discriminating role was associated to IL-10 and IL-17 release in TB patients. Our data indicate that the flow cytometric cytokine-secreting cell detection technique may be envisaged as an additional tool for TB diagnosis allowing the analysis of the immune response to M. tuberculosis-related antigens in the different stages of TB.
0 A comparative proteomic analysis of the simple amino acid repeat distributions in Plasmodia reveals lineage specific amino acid selection. Microsatellites have been used extensively in the field of comparative genomics. By studying microsatellites in coding regions we have a simple model of how genotypic changes undergo selection as they are directly expressed in the phenotype as altered proteins. The simplest of these tandem repeats in coding regions are the tri-nucleotide repeats which produce a repeat of a single amino acid when translated into proteins. Tri-nucleotide repeats are often disease associated, and are also known to be unstable to both expansion and contraction. This makes them sensitive markers for studying proteome evolution, in closely related species. The evolutionary history of the family of malarial causing parasites Plasmodia is complex because of the life-cycle of the organism, where it interacts with a number of different hosts and goes through a series of tissue specific stages. This study shows that the divergence between the primate and rodent malarial parasites has resulted in a lineage specific change in the simple amino acid repeat distribution that is correlated to A-T content. The paper also shows that this altered use of amino acids in SAARs is consistent with the repeat distributions being under selective pressure. The study shows that simple amino acid repeat distributions can be used to group related species and to examine their phylogenetic relationships. This study also shows that an outgroup species with a similar A-T content can be distinguished based only on the amino acid usage in repeats, and suggest that this might be a useful feature for proteome clustering. The lineage specific use of amino acids in repeat regions suggests that comparative studies of SAAR distributions between proteomes gives an insight into the mechanisms of expansion and the selective pressures acting on the organism.
3 Cough and its importance in COPD. Patients with COPD most frequently complain of breathlessness and cough and these are both increased during exacerbations. Studies have generally focused on quality of life during end-stage disease, where breathlessness becomes dominant and cough less important. There are very little data on the frequency and severity of cough in COPD or its impact on quality of life at different stages of disease. Little is known about the factors that influence objective cough counts in COPD. Cough may be a marker for progressive disease in milder COPD patients who continue to smoke, and it may be useful in case-finding for milder disease in the community.The cough reflex sensitivity is heightened in COPD compared with healthy volunteers and similar to that in subjects with asthma. The degree of airflow obstruction does not predict cough reflex sensitivity or objective cough counts, implying an independent process. Effective treatments for cough in COPD have not yet been identified. Improved outcome measures of cough, a better understanding of cough in the natural history of COPD, and its importance to patients are needed.
3 Interactions between beta subunits of the KCNMB family and Slo3: beta4 selectively modulates Slo3 expression and function. The pH and voltage-regulated Slo3 K(+) channel, a homologue of the Ca(2+)- and voltage-regulated Slo1 K(+) channel, is thought to be primarily expressed in sperm, but the properties of Slo3 studied in heterologous systems differ somewhat from the native sperm KSper pH-regulated current. There is the possibility that critical partners that regulate Slo3 function remain unidentified. The extensive amino acid identity between Slo3 and Slo1 suggests that auxiliary beta subunits regulating Slo1 channels might coassemble with and modulate Slo3 channels. Four distinct beta subunits composing the KCNMB family are known to regulate the function and expression of Slo1 Channels. To examine the ability of the KCNMB family of auxiliary beta subunits to regulate Slo3 function, we co-expressed Slo3 and each beta subunit in heterologous expression systems and investigated the functional consequences by electrophysiological and biochemical analyses. The beta4 subunit produced an 8-10 fold enhancement of Slo3 current expression in Xenopus oocytes and a similar enhancement of Slo3 surface expression as monitored by YFP-tagged Slo3 or biotin labeled Slo3. Neither beta1, beta2, nor beta3 mimicked the ability of beta4 to increase surface expression, although biochemical tests suggested that all four beta subunits are competent to coassemble with Slo3. Fluorescence microscopy from beta4 KO mice, in which an eGFP tag replaced the deleted exon, revealed that beta4 gene promoter is active in spermatocytes. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that beta4 and Slo3 exhibit comparable mRNA abundance in both testes and sperm. These results argue that, for native mouse Slo3 channels, the beta4 subunit must be considered as a potential interaction partner and, furthermore, that KCNMB subunits may have functions unrelated to regulation of the Slo1 alpha subunit.
1 Biophysical mechanism for ras-nanocluster formation and signaling in plasma membrane. Ras GTPases are lipid-anchored G proteins, which play a fundamental role in cell signaling processes. Electron micrographs of immunogold-labeled Ras have shown that membrane-bound Ras molecules segregate into nanocluster domains. Several models have been developed in attempts to obtain quantitative descriptions of nanocluster formation, but all have relied on assumptions such as a constant, expression-level independent ratio of Ras in clusters to Ras monomers (cluster/monomer ratio). However, this assumption is inconsistent with the law of mass action. Here, we present a biophysical model of Ras clustering based on short-range attraction and long-range repulsion between Ras molecules in the membrane. To test this model, we performed Monte Carlo simulations and compared statistical clustering properties with experimental data. We find that we can recover the experimentally-observed clustering across a range of Ras expression levels, without assuming a constant cluster/monomer ratio or the existence of lipid rafts. In addition, our model makes predictions about the signaling properties of Ras nanoclusters in support of the idea that Ras nanoclusters act as an analog-digital-analog converter for high fidelity signaling.
1 16S rRNA gene-based analysis of fecal microbiota from preterm infants with and without necrotizing enterocolitis. Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory intestinal disorder affecting preterm infants. Intestinal bacteria have an important function; however no causative pathogen has been identified. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are differences in microbial patterns that may be critical to the development of this disease. Fecal samples from 20 preterm infants, 10 with NEC and 10 matched controls (including 4 twin pairs) were obtained from patients in a single site level III neonatal intensive care unit. Bacterial DNA from individual fecal samples was PCR-amplified and subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and library sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize diversity and structure of the enteric microbiota. The distribution of samples from NEC patients distinctly clustered separately from controls. Intestinal bacterial colonization in all preterm infants was notable for low diversity. Patients with NEC had even less diversity, an increase in abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, a decrease in other bacteria species, and had received a higher mean number of previous days of antibiotics. Our results suggest that NEC is associated with severe lack of microbiota diversity that may accentuate the impact of single dominant microorganisms favored by empiric and widespread use of antibiotics.
0 Retroperitoneal malignant mesenchymoma: a case of mesenchymal mixed tumor with osteosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Malignant mesenchymoma is an interesting but very rare tumor in which malignant differentiation has occurred twice or more. We report a case of retroperitoneal malignant mesenchymoma consisting of osteosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Abdominal CT showed a large retroperitoneal mass with two separate and distinct parts, namely an area of prominent calcification and one of clearly enhancing solid components. The mass contained histologically distinct tumorous components with no histologic admixure at the interfaces. The densely calcified nodule corresponded to osteosarcoma, and the noncalcified clearly enhancing nodules to leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma and fibrosarcoma.
1 Does publication in top-tier journals affect reviewer behavior? We show that when ecologists act as reviewers their reported rejection rates recommended for manuscripts increases with their publication frequency in high impact factor journals. Rejection rate however does not relate to reviewer age. These results indicate that the likelihood of getting a paper accepted for publication may depend upon factors in addition to scientific merit. Multiple reviewer selection for a given manuscript therefore should consider not only appropriate expertise, but also reviewers that have variable publication experience with a range of different journals to ensure balanced treatment. Interestingly since age did not relate to rejection rates, more senior scientists are not necessarily more jaded in reviewing practices.
1 Prognostic value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in type 2 diabetic patients with mild, stable angina pectoris. To determine the prognostic value of reversible myocardial perfusion defects on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild anginal complaints. In the MERIDIAN trial, patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, stable, mild anginal symptoms (Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification (CCS) I-II/IV) and reversible perfusion defects were randomized to either continued pharmacological treatment or early invasive treatment. In this sub analysis, the severity of the myocardial perfusion defect was related to the occurrence of cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction, in 319 patients (63% male, 65 +/- 9 years). During follow-up (2.2 +/- 0.6 years), 14 patients had a cardiac event: 3 in 171 patients without myocardial ischemia and 11 in 148 patients with myocardial ischemia. Annual event rates rose from 0.8% to 5.8% with increasing severity of myocardial ischemia. Multivariable analysis identified the presence of severe myocardial ischemia (hazard ratio (HR) 5.45, 95%CI 1.89-15.71) and insulin use (HR 4.00, 95%CI 1.25-12.75) as independent predictors of cardiac events. Type 2 diabetics with mild anginal symptoms with no or moderate myocardial ischemia have a low annual cardiac event rate. In patients with severe myocardial ischemia event rate increased 3-6 fold.
0 Quality of life following liver transplantation: a comparative study between Familial Amyloid Neuropathy and liver disease patients. It has been demonstrated in many studies that quality of life can be improved after liver transplantation in patients with liver disease. Nevertheless, quality of life improvement in specific groups of transplanted patients such as those with Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy has not yet been explored. The present study aimed to compare the change in quality of life following liver transplantation between patients with Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) and patients with liver disease. Patient's mental quality of life showed an improvement in all liver disease patients, and a worsening in FAP patients, resulting in a significant difference between the two groups. Regarding physical quality of life, although a similar improvement was seen in both groups, FAP patients had significantly less improvement than the sub-group of decompensated liver disease (Child-Pugh B and C). It is concluded that liver transplantation has a less beneficial impact in FAP patient's physical quality of life, probably because they are not so much disabled by their disease at the moment of liver transplantation. The lesser improvement in mental quality of life of FAP patients may be due to their particular psychological profile and greater expectations towards transplantation.
1 Identification of roots from grass swards using PCR-RFLP and FFLP of the plastid trnL (UAA) intron. The specific associations between plant roots and the soil microbial community are key to understanding nutrient cycling in grasslands, but grass roots can be difficult to identify using morphology alone. A molecular technique to identify plant species from root DNA would greatly facilitate investigations of the root rhizosphere. We show that trnL PCR product length heterogeneity and a maximum of two restriction digests can separate 14 common grassland species. The RFLP key was used to identify root fragments at least to genus level in a field study of upland grassland community diversity. Roots which could not be matched to known types were putatively identified by comparison of the nuclear ribosomal ITS sequence to the GenBank database. Ten taxa were identified among almost 600 root fragments. Additionally, we have employed capillary electrophoresis of fluorescent trnL PCR products (fluorescent fragment length polymorphism, FFLP) to discriminate all taxa identified at the field site. We have developed a molecular database for the identification of some common grassland species based on PCR-RFLP of the plastid transfer RNA leucine (trnL) UAA gene intron. This technique will allow fine-scale studies of the rhizosphere, where root identification by morphology is unrealistic and high throughput is desirable.
1 Data correction pre-processing for electronically stored blood culture results: implications on microbial spectrum and empiric antibiotic therapy. The outcome of patients with bacteraemia is influenced by the initial selection of adequate antimicrobial therapy. The objective of our study was to clarify the influence of different crude data correction methods on a) microbial spectrum and ranking of pathogens, and b) cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of blood culture isolates obtained from patients from intensive care units (ICUs) using a computer based tool, MONI. Analysis of 13 ICUs over a period of 7 years yielded 1427 microorganisms from positive results. Three different data correction methods were applied. Raw data method (RDM): Data without further correction, including all positive blood culture results. Duplicate-free method (DFM): Correction of raw data for consecutive patient's results yielding same microorganism with similar antibiogram within a two-week period. Contaminant-free method (CFM): Bacteraemia caused by possible contaminants was only assumed as true bloodstream infection, if an organism of the same species was isolated from > 2 sets of blood cultures within 5 days. Our study demonstrates that different approaches towards raw data correction - none (RDM), duplicate-free (DFM), and a contaminant-free method (CFM) - show different results in analysis of positive blood cultures. Regarding the spectrum of microorganisms, RDM and DFM yielded almost similar results in ranking of microorganisms, whereas using the CFM resulted in a clinically and epidemiologically more plausible spectrum. For possible skin contaminants, the proportion of microorganisms in terms of number of episodes is most influenced by the CFM, followed by the DFM. However, with exception of fusidic acid for gram-positive organisms, none of the evaluated correction methods would have changed advice for empiric therapy on the selected ICUs.
0 Qualia: the geometry of integrated information. According to the integrated information theory, the quantity of consciousness is the amount of integrated information generated by a complex of elements, and the quality of experience is specified by the informational relationships it generates. This paper outlines a framework for characterizing the informational relationships generated by such systems. Qualia space (Q) is a space having an axis for each possible state (activity pattern) of a complex. Within Q, each submechanism specifies a point corresponding to a repertoire of system states. Arrows between repertoires in Q define informational relationships. Together, these arrows specify a quale -- a shape that completely and univocally characterizes the quality of a conscious experience. Phi -- the height of this shape -- is the quantity of consciousness associated with the experience. Entanglement measures how irreducible informational relationships are to their component relationships, specifying concepts and modes. Several corollaries follow from these premises. The quale is determined by both the mechanism and state of the system. Thus, two different systems having identical activity patterns may generate different qualia. Conversely, the same quale may be generated by two systems that differ in both activity and connectivity. Both active and inactive elements specify a quale, but elements that are inactivated do not. Also, the activation of an element affects experience by changing the shape of the quale. The subdivision of experience into modalities and submodalities corresponds to subshapes in Q. In principle, different aspects of experience may be classified as different shapes in Q, and the similarity between experiences reduces to similarities between shapes. Finally, specific qualities, such as the "redness" of red, while generated by a local mechanism, cannot be reduced to it, but require considering the entire quale. Ultimately, the present framework may offer a principled way for translating qualitative properties of experience into mathematics.
1 Staging of cutaneous melanoma. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging of cutaneous melanoma is a continuously evolving system. The identification of increasingly more accurate prognostic factors has led to major changes in melanoma staging over the years, and the current system described in this review will likely be modified in the near future. Likewise, application of new imaging techniques has also changed the staging work-up of patients with cutaneous melanoma. Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning is most commonly used for evaluation of potential metastatic sites in the lungs, lymph nodes and liver, and is indicated in patients with new symptoms, anaemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase or a chest X-ray abnormality. CT scans should be restricted to patients with high-risk melanoma (stage IIC, IIIB, IIIC and stage IIIA with a macroscopic sentinel lymph node). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is a mandatory test in patients with stage IV, optional in stage III and not used in patients with stage I and II disease. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is more accurate than CT or MRI alone in the diagnosis of metastases and should complement conventional CT/MRI imaging in the staging work-up of patients who have solitary or oligometastatic disease where surgical resection is most relevant.
3 A challenge to Goliath. Megapublishers obligate librarians to buy hundreds of journals they do not need in order to access the journals their constituents actually read. The time has come to challenge this business model, which is unsustainable for the libraries.
0 The expression of the beta-defensins hBD-2 and hBD-3 is differentially regulated by NF-kappaB and MAPK/AP-1 pathways in an in vitro model of Candida esophagitis. Candida albicans resides on epithelial surfaces as part of the physiological microflora. However, under certain conditions it may cause life-threatening infections like Candida sepsis. Human beta-defensins (hBDs) are critical components of host defense at mucosal surfaces and we have recently shown that hBD-2 and hBD-3 are upregulated in Candida esophagitis. We therefore studied the role of Candidate signalling pathways in order to understand the mechanisms involved in regulation of hBD-expression by C. albicans. We used the esophageal cell line OE21 and analysed the role of paracrine signals from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in an in vitro model of esophageal candidiasis. Supernatants of C. albicans or indirect coculture with C. albicans induces upregulation of hBD-2 and hBD-3 expression. PMNs strongly amplifies C. albicans-mediated induction of hBDs. By EMSA we demonstrate that C. albicans activates NF-kappaB and AP-1 in OE21 cells. Inhibition of these pathways revealed that hBD-2 expression is synergistically regulated by both NF-kappaB and AP-1. In contrast hBD-3 expression is independent of NF-kappaB and relies solely on an EGFR/MAPK/AP-1-dependent pathway. Our analysis of signal transduction events demonstrate a functional interaction of epithelial cells with PMNs in response to Candida infection involving divergent signalling events that differentially govern hBD-2 and hBD-3 expression.
0 Differences between CusA and AcrB crystallisation highlighted by protein flexibility. Until very recently, AcrB was the only Resistance Nodulation and cell Division transporter for which the structure has been elucidated. Towards a general understanding of this protein family, CusA and AcrB were compared. In dodecylmaltoside, AcrB crystallised in many different conditions, while CusA does not. This could be due to the difference in dynamic between these proteins as judged from limited proteolysis assays. Addition of various compounds, in particular heavy metal cations, stabilises CusA. This approach could constitute a first step towards CusA crystallisation.
0 Nucleus accumbens CREB activity is necessary for nicotine conditioned place preference. The ability of nicotine to alter firing of dopamine neurons is the first step leading to nicotine reward, but activation of intracellular signaling pathways downstream of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is likely to be critical for longer-term consequences of nicotine exposure, including conditioned reward. The transcription factor cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) is important for new gene transcription and in its phosphorylated form (pCREB) promotes long-term changes in synaptic strength. Previous studies have implicated nucleus accumbens (NAc) CREB activity in the modulation of cocaine and morphine reward, and have shown that nicotine conditioned place preference (CPP) is associated with NAc CREB activation. It is not clear whether CPP elicits phosphorylation of CREB or if elevations in pCREB support nicotine CPP. In the current study, we investigated levels of CREB and pCREB during Pavlovian conditioning with nicotine in a novel context in the absence of chamber choice. Nicotine context conditioning resulted in elevated pCREB levels in the NAc shell but not the NAc core of mice following placement in the nicotine-paired chamber in the absence of nicotine. To test if CREB activity in the NAc shell contributes to cue-induced responses that may precipitate nicotine-seeking, we used viral-mediated gene transfer of a dominant-negative CREB construct in the NAc shell of C57BL/6J mice and found that disruption of CREB activation before training blocked nicotine place preference across a range of doses. Taken together, these studies identify the NAc shell as a brain region where CREB activity is essential for nicotine CPP.
1 Unit-cell determination from randomly oriented electron-diffraction patterns. Unit-cell determination is the first step towards the structure solution of an unknown crystal form. Standard procedures for unit-cell determination cannot cope with data collections that consist of single diffraction patterns of multiple crystals, each with an unknown orientation. However, for beam-sensitive nanocrystals these are often the only data that can be obtained. An algorithm for unit-cell determination that uses randomly oriented electron-diffraction patterns with unknown angular relationships is presented here. The algorithm determined the unit cells of mineral, pharmaceutical and protein nanocrystals in orthorhombic high- and low-symmetry space groups, allowing (well oriented) patterns to be indexed.
1 Intracellular calcium strongly potentiates agonist-activated TRPC5 channels. TRPC5 is a calcium (Ca(2+))-permeable nonselective cation channel expressed in several brain regions, including the hippocampus, cerebellum, and amygdala. Although TRPC5 is activated by receptors coupled to phospholipase C, the precise signaling pathway and modulatory signals remain poorly defined. We find that during continuous agonist activation, heterologously expressed TRPC5 currents are potentiated in a voltage-dependent manner ( approximately 5-fold at positive potentials and approximately 25-fold at negative potentials). The reversal potential, doubly rectifying current-voltage relation, and permeability to large cations such as N-methyl-d-glucamine remain unchanged during this potentiation. The TRPC5 current potentiation depends on extracellular Ca(2+): replacement by Ba(2+) or Mg(2+) abolishes it, whereas the addition of 10 mM Ca(2+) accelerates it. The site of action for Ca(2+) is intracellular, as simultaneous fura-2 imaging and patch clamp recordings indicate that potentiation is triggered at approximately 1 microM [Ca(2+)]. This potentiation is prevented when intracellular Ca(2+) is tightly buffered, but it is promoted when recording with internal solutions containing elevated [Ca(2+)]. In cell-attached and excised inside-out single-channel recordings, increases in internal [Ca(2+)] led to an approximately 10-20-fold increase in channel open probability, whereas single-channel conductance was unchanged. Ca(2+)-dependent potentiation should result in TRPC5 channel activation preferentially during periods of repetitive firing or coincident neurotransmitter receptor activation.
3 Characterization of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates from blood with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides and therapeutic options. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are a major cause of nosocomial blood stream infection, especially in critically ill and haematology patients. CoNS are usually multidrug-resistant and glycopeptide antibiotics have been to date considered the drugs of choice for treatment. The aim of this study was to characterize CoNS with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides causing blood stream infection (BSI) in critically ill and haematology patients at the University Hospital Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy, in 2007. Hospital microbiology records for transplant haematology and ICU were reviewed to identify CoNS with elevated MICs for glycopeptides, and isolates were matched to clinical records to determine whether the isolates caused a BSI. The isolates were tested for susceptibility to new drugs daptomicin and tigecycline and the genetic relationship was assessed using f-AFLP. Of a total of 17,418 blood cultures, 1,609 were positive for CoNS and of these, 87 (5.4%) displayed reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides. Clinical review revealed that in 13 cases (7 in haematology and 6 in ICU), CoNS with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides were responsible for a BSI. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the causative organism in 11 instances and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 2. The incidence of oxacillin resistance was high (77%), although all isolates remained susceptible to linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline. Fingerprinting of CoNS identified one clonal relationship between two isolates. Multi-resistant CoNS with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides, although still relatively infrequent in our hospital, are emerging pathogens of clinical concern. Surveillance by antibiotyping with attention to multi-resistant profile, and warning to clinicians, is necessary.
3 Localisation of GPR30, a novel G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor, suggests multiple functions in rodent brain and peripheral tissues. Recently, the G protein-coupled receptor GPR30 has been identified as a novel oestrogen receptor (ER). The distribution of the receptor has been thus far mapped only in the rat central nervous system. This study was undertaken to map the distribution of GPR30 in the mouse brain and rodent peripheral tissues. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody against GPR30 revealed high levels of GPR30 immunoreactivity (ir) in the forebrain (e.g. cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus), specific nuclei of the midbrain (e.g. the pontine nuclei and locus coeruleus) and the trigeminal nuclei and cerebellum Purkinje layer of the hindbrain in the adult mouse brain. In the rat and mouse periphery, GPR30-ir was detected in the anterior, intermediate and neural lobe of the pituitary, adrenal medulla, renal pelvis and ovary. In situ hybridisation histochemistry using GPR30 riboprobes, revealed intense hybridisation signal for GPR30 in the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus, anterior and intermediate lobe of the pituitary, adrenal medulla, renal pelvis and ovary of both rat and mouse. Double immunofluorescence revealed GPR30 was present in both oxytocin and vasopressin neurones of the paraventricular nucleus and SON of the rat and mouse brain. The distribution of GPR30 is distinct from the other traditional ERs and offers an additional way in which oestrogen may mediate its effects in numerous brain regions and endocrine systems in the rodent.
3 New azaphilones, seco-chaetomugilins A and D, produced by a marine-fish-derived Chaetomium globosum. Seco-chaetomugilins A and D were isolated from a strain of Chaetomium globosum that was originally isolated from the marine fish Mugil cephalus, and their absolute stereostructures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analyses, including 1D and 2D NMR techniques, along with the chemical transformation from known chaetomugilins A and D. Seco-chaetomugilin D exhibited growth inhibitory activity against cultured P388, HL-60, L1210, and KB cells.
1 Synthesis, characterization, and theory of [9]-, [12]-, and [18]cycloparaphenylene: carbon nanohoop structures. The first synthesis and characterization of [9]-, [12]-, and [18]cycloparaphenylene was demonstrated utilizing a novel aromatization reaction. We refer to these fascinating structures as "carbon nanohoops" due to their structural similarity to carbon nanotubes. Additionally, we have utilized computational methods to understand the unique properties of these fully conjugated macrocycles.
1 Staphylococcus aureus Panton-Valentine leukocidin contributes to inflammation and muscle tissue injury. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) threatens public health worldwide, and epidemiologic data suggest that the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) expressed by most CA-MRSA strains could contribute to severe human infections, particularly in young and immunocompetent hosts. PVL is proposed to induce cytolysis or apoptosis of phagocytes. However, recent comparisons of isogenic CA-MRSA strains with or without PVL have revealed no differences in human PMN cytolytic activity. Furthermore, many of the mouse studies performed to date have failed to demonstrate a virulence role for PVL, thereby provoking the question: does PVL have a mechanistic role in human infection? In this report, we evaluated the contribution of PVL to severe skin and soft tissue infection. We generated PVL mutants in CA-MRSA strains isolated from patients with necrotizing fasciitis and used these tools to evaluate the pathogenic role of PVL in vivo. In a model of necrotizing soft tissue infection, we found PVL caused significant damage of muscle but not the skin. Muscle injury was linked to induction of pro-inflammatory chemokines KC, MIP-2, and RANTES, and recruitment of neutrophils. Tissue damage was most prominent in young mice and in those strains of mice that more effectively cleared S. aureus, and was not significant in older mice and mouse strains that had a more limited immune response to the pathogen. PVL mediated injury could be blocked by pretreatment with anti-PVL antibodies. Our data provide new insights into CA-MRSA pathogenesis, epidemiology and therapeutics. PVL could contribute to the increased incidence of myositis in CA-MRSA infection, and the toxin could mediate tissue injury by mechanisms other than direct killing of phagocytes.
0 Beating the blues after cancer: randomised controlled trial of a tele-based psychological intervention for high distress patients and carers. The diagnosis and treatment of cancer is a major life stress such that approximately 35% of patients experience persistent clinically significant distress and carers often experience even higher distress than patients. This paper presents the design of a two arm randomised controlled trial with patients and carers who have elevated psychological distress comparing minimal contact self management vs. an individualised tele-based cognitive behavioural intervention. 140 patients and 140 carers per condition (560 participants in total) will been recruited after being identified as high distress through caller screening at two community-based cancer helplines and randomised to 1) a single 30-minute telephone support and education session with a nurse counsellor with self management materials 2) a tele-based psychologist delivered five session individualised cognitive behavioural intervention. Session components will include stress reduction, problem-solving, cognitive challenging and enhancing relationship support and will be delivered weekly. Participants will be assessed at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months after recruitment. Outcome measures include: anxiety and depression, cancer specific distress, unmet psychological supportive care needs, positive adjustment, overall Quality of life. The study will provide recommendations about the efficacy and potential economic value of minimal contact self management vs. tele-based psychologist delivered cognitive behavioural intervention to facilitate better psychosocial adjustment and mental health for people with cancer and their carers.

3 Limitations of remotely sensed aerosol as a spatial proxy for fine particulate matter. Recent research highlights the promise of remotely sensed aerosol optical depth (AOD) as a proxy for ground-level particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <or= 2.5 microm (PM(2.5)). Particular interest lies in estimating spatial heterogeneity using AOD, with important application to estimating pollution exposure for public health purposes. Given the correlations reported between AOD and PM(2.5), it is tempting to interpret the spatial patterns in AOD as reflecting patterns in PM(2.5). We evaluated the degree to which AOD can help predict long-term average PM(2.5) concentrations for use in chronic health studies. We calculated correlations of AOD and PM(2.5) at various temporal aggregations in the eastern United States in 2004 and used statistical models to assess the relationship between AOD and PM(2.5) and the potential for improving predictions of PM(2.5) in a subregion, the mid-Atlantic. We found only limited spatial associations of AOD from three satellite retrievals with daily and yearly PM(2.5). The statistical modeling shows that monthly average AOD poorly reflects spatial patterns in PM(2.5) because of systematic, spatially correlated discrepancies between AOD and PM(2.5). Furthermore, when we included AOD as a predictor of monthly PM(2.5) in a statistical prediction model, AOD provided little additional information in a model that already accounts for land use, emission sources, meteorology, and regional variability. These results suggest caution in using spatial variation in currently available AOD to stand in for spatial variation in ground-level PM(2.5) in epidemiologic analyses and indicate that when PM(2.5) monitoring is available, careful statistical modeling outperforms the use of AOD.
1 Bat eyes have ultraviolet-sensitive cone photoreceptors. Mammalian retinae have rod photoreceptors for night vision and cone photoreceptors for daylight and colour vision. For colour discrimination, most mammals possess two cone populations with two visual pigments (opsins) that have absorption maxima at short wavelengths (blue or ultraviolet light) and long wavelengths (green or red light). Microchiropteran bats, which use echolocation to navigate and forage in complete darkness, have long been considered to have pure rod retinae. Here we use opsin immunohistochemistry to show that two phyllostomid microbats, Glossophaga soricina and Carollia perspicillata, possess a significant population of cones and express two cone opsins, a shortwave-sensitive (S) opsin and a longwave-sensitive (L) opsin. A substantial population of cones expresses S opsin exclusively, whereas the other cones mostly coexpress L and S opsin. S opsin gene analysis suggests ultraviolet (UV, wavelengths <400 nm) sensitivity, and corneal electroretinogram recordings reveal an elevated sensitivity to UV light which is mediated by an S cone visual pigment. Therefore bats have retained the ancestral UV tuning of the S cone pigment. We conclude that bats have the prerequisite for daylight vision, dichromatic colour vision, and UV vision. For bats, the UV-sensitive cones may be advantageous for visual orientation at twilight, predator avoidance, and detection of UV-reflecting flowers for those that feed on nectar.
0 Genetic and epigenetic marker-based DNA test of stool is a promising approach for colorectal cancer screening. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies and leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world.1 However, it may be treated effectively by surgical removal of the cancerous tissue if detected at early stages. Conventional tools for screening CRC are either invasive or inaccurate. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a reliable screening tools for CRC to significantly reduce its morbidity. In this regard, a novel DNA markers-based detection in stool is emerging as a promising approach.
3 Pyrin Modulates the Intracellular Distribution of PSTPIP1. PSTPIP1 is a cytoskeleton-associated adaptor protein that links PEST-type phosphatases to their substrates. Mutations in PSTPIP1 cause PAPA syndrome (Pyogenic sterile Arthritis, Pyoderma gangrenosum, and Acne), an autoinflammatory disease. PSTPIP1 binds to pyrin and mutations in pyrin result in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a related autoinflammatory disorder. Since disease-associated mutations in PSTPIP1 enhance pyrin binding, PAPA syndrome and FMF are thought to share a common pathoetiology. The studies outlined here describe several new aspects of PSTPIP1 and pyrin biology. We document that PSTPIP1, which has homology to membrane-deforming BAR proteins, forms homodimers and generates membrane-associated filaments in native and transfected cells. An extended FCH (Fes-Cip4 homology) domain in PSTPIP1 is necessary and sufficient for its self-aggregation. We further show that the PSTPIP1 filament network is dependent upon an intact tubulin cytoskeleton and that the distribution of this network can be modulated by pyrin, indicating that this is a dynamic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that pyrin can recruit PSTPIP1 into aggregations (specks) of ASC, another pyrin binding protein. ASC specks are associated with inflammasome activity. PSTPIP1 molecules with PAPA-associated mutations are recruited by pyrin to ASC specks with particularly high efficiency, suggesting a unique mechanism underlying the robust inflammatory phenotype of PAPA syndrome.
1 PAR1 is selectively over expressed in high grade breast cancer patients: a cohort study. The protease-activated receptor (PAR1) expression is correlated with the degree of invasiveness in cell lines. Nevertheless it has never been directed involved in breast cancer patients progression. The aim of this study was to determine whether PAR1 expression could be used as predictor of metastases and mortality. In a cohort of patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma studied longitudinally since 1996 and until 2007, PAR1 over-expression was assessed by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and flow citometry. Chi-square and log rank tests were used to determine whether there was a statistical association between PAR1 overexpression and metastases, mortality, and survival. Multivariate analysis was performed including HER1, stage, ER and nodes status to evaluate PAR1 as an independent prognostic factor. Follow up was 95 months (range: 2-130 months). We assayed PAR1 in a cohort of patients composed of 136 patients; we found PAR1 expression assayed by immunoblotting was selectively associated with high grade patients (50 cases of the study cohort; P = 0.001). Twenty-nine of 50 (58%) patients overexpressed PAR1, and 23 of these (46%) developed metastases. HER1, stage, ER and PAR1 overexpression were robustly correlated (Cox regression, P = 0.002, P = 0.024 and P = 0.002 respectively). Twenty-one of the 50 patients (42%) expressed both receptors (PAR1 and HER1 P = 0.0004). We also found a statistically significant correlation between PAR1 overexpression and increased mortality (P = 0.0001) and development of metastases (P = 0.0009). Our data suggest PAR1 overexpression may be involved in the development of metastases in breast cancer patient and is associated with undifferentiated cellular progression of the tumor. Further studies are needed to understand PAR1 mechanism of action and in a near future assay its potential use as risk factor for metastasis development in high grade breast cancer patients.
3 Bacillus cereus spores release alanine that synergizes with inosine to promote germination. The first step of the bacterial lifecycle is the germination of bacterial spores into their vegetative form, which requires the presence of specific nutrients. In contrast to closely related Bacillus anthracis spores, Bacillus cereus spores germinate in the presence of a single germinant, inosine, yet with a significant lag period. We found that the initial lag period of inosine-treated germination of B. cereus spores disappeared in the presence of supernatants derived from already germinated spores. The lag period also dissipated when inosine was supplemented with the co-germinator alanine. In fact, HPLC-based analysis revealed the presence of amino acids in the supernatant of germinated B. cereus spores. The released amino acids included alanine in concentrations sufficient to promote rapid germination of inosine-treated spores. The alanine racemase inhibitor D-cycloserine enhanced germination of B. cereus spores, presumably by increasing the L-alanine concentration in the supernatant. Moreover, we found that B. cereus spores lacking the germination receptors gerI and gerQ did not germinate and release amino acids in the presence of inosine. These mutant spores, however, germinated efficiently when inosine was supplemented with alanine. Finally, removal of released amino acids in a washout experiment abrogated inosine-mediated germination of B. cereus spores. We found that the single germinant inosine is able to trigger a two-tier mechanism for inosine-mediated germination of B. cereus spores: Inosine mediates the release of alanine, an essential step to complete the germination process. Therefore, B. cereus spores appear to have developed a unique quorum-sensing feedback mechanism to monitor spore density and to coordinate germination.
1 A serum- and feeder-free technique of culturing human corneal epithelial stem cells on amniotic membrane. To describe a simple technique of cultivating human corneal epithelial stem cells using an Epilife culture medium under serum- and feeder-free conditions. Cadaveric donor limbal corneal epithelial cells were cultured on denuded amniotic membranes using an explant technique that was free of serum and feeder cells in the Epilife medium containing a growth supplement of defined composition. These cells were assessed by phase contrast microscope. The expressions of the proposed corneal epithelial stem cell markers (p63, ATP-binding cassette member 2 (ABCG2), and cytokeratin 15 and 19) and differentiation markers (cytokeratin 3, 12, connexin 43, and p75) were analyzed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemical staining. Successful cultures were obtained, resulting in a monolayer to double layer cell sheets with a cobblestone-like morphology. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry disclosed an expression of both putative limbal stem cell (LSC) markers and differentiation-associated markers in the cultured cells. Most of the cultured corneal epithelial cells that were immunopositive for putative LSC markers were smaller, more uniform, and closer to the limbal explant than cells positively stained with differentiation-associated markers. A serum- and feeder-free culture system using Epilife medium may grow human corneal epithelial equivalents, minimizing the risk of contamination during culture. The technique may also be useful for the clinical application of limbal stem cell culture.
0 Colorectal carcinomas in MUTYH-associated polyposis display histopathological similarities to microsatellite unstable carcinomas. MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is a recessively inherited disorder which predisposes biallelic carriers for a high risk of polyposis and colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Since about one third of the biallelic MAP patients in population based CRC series has no adenomas, this study aimed to identify specific clinicopathological characteristics of MAP CRCs and compare these with reported data on sporadic and Lynch CRCs. From 44 MAP patients who developed > or = 1 CRCs, 42 of 58 tumours were analyzed histologically and 35 immunohistochemically for p53 and beta-catenin. Cell densities of CD3, CD8, CD57, and granzyme B positive lymphocytes were determined. KRAS2, the mutation cluster region (MCR) of APC, p53, and SMAD4 were analyzed for somatic mutations. MAP CRCs frequently localized to the proximal colon (69%, 40/58), were mucinous in 21% (9/42), and had a conspicuous Crohn's like infiltrate reaction in 33% (13/40); all of these parameters occurred at a higher rate than reported for sporadic CRCs. Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were also highly prevalent in MAP CRCs. Somatic APC MCR mutations occurred in 14% (5/36) while 64% (23/36) had KRAS2 mutations (22/23 c.34G>T). G>T transversions were found in p53 and SMAD4, although the relative frequency compared to other mutations was low. MAP CRCs show some similarities to micro-satellite unstable cancers, with a preferential proximal location, a high rate of mucinous histotype and increased presence of TILs. These features should direct the practicing pathologist towards a MAP aetiology of CRC as an alternative for a mismatch repair deficient cause. High frequent G>T transversions in APC and KRAS2 (mutated in early tumour development) but not in P53 and SMAD4 (implicated in tumour progression) might indicate a predominant MUTYH effect in early carcinogenesis.
3 Precambrian lunar volcanic protolife. Five representative terrestrial analogs of lunar craters are detailed relevant to Precambrian fumarolic activity. Fumarolic fluids contain the ingredients for protolife. Energy sources to derive formaldehyde, amino acids and related compounds could be by flow charging, charge separation and volcanic shock. With no photodecomposition in shadow, most fumarolic fluids at 40 K would persist over geologically long time periods. Relatively abundant tungsten would permit creation of critical enzymes, Fischer-Tropsch reactions could form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soluble volcanic polyphosphates would enable assembly of nucleic acids. Fumarolic stimuli factors are described. Orbital and lander sensors specific to protolife exploration including combined Raman/laser-induced breakdown spectrocsopy are evaluated.
2 New potential treatments for protection of pancreatic B-cell function in Type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes mellitus results from the progressive and specific autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic B-cells, which develops over a period of years and continues after the initial clinical presentation. The ultimate goal of therapeutic intervention is prevention or reversal of the disease by the arrest of autoimmunity and by preservation/restoration of B-cell mass and function. Recent clinical trials of antigen-specific or non-specific immune therapies have proved that modulation of islet specific autoimmunity in humans and prevention of insulin secretion loss in the short term after the onset of disease is achievable. The identification of suitable candidates for therapy, appropriate dosage and timing, specificity of intervention and the side-effect profile are crucial for the success of any approach. Considering the complexity of the disease, it is likely that a rationally designed approach of combined immune-based therapies that target suppression of B-cell specific autoreactivity and maintenance of immune tolerance, coupled with islet regeneration or replacement of the destroyed B-cell mass, will prove to be most effective in causing remission/reversal of disease in a durable fashion.
1 Genome-wide scans using archived neonatal dried blood spot samples. Identification of disease susceptible genes requires access to DNA from numerous well-characterised subjects. Archived residual dried blood spot samples from national newborn screening programs may provide DNA from entire populations and medical registries the corresponding clinical information. The amount of DNA available in these samples is however rarely sufficient for reliable genome-wide scans, and whole-genome amplification may thus be necessary. This study assess the quality of DNA obtained from different amplification protocols by evaluating fidelity and robustness of the genotyping of 610,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, using the Illumina Infinium HD Human610-Quad BeadChip. Whole-genome amplified DNA from 24 neonatal dried blood spot samples stored between 15 to 25 years was tested, and high-quality genomic DNA from 8 of the same individuals was used as reference. Using 3.2 mm disks from dried blood spot samples the optimal DNA-extraction and amplification protocol resulted in call-rates between 99.15% - 99.73% (mean 99.56%, N = 16), and conflicts with reference DNA in only three per 10,000 genotype calls. Whole-genome amplified DNA from archived neonatal dried blood spot samples can be used for reliable genome-wide scans and is a cost-efficient alternative to collecting new samples.
1 A strategy for enrichment of claudins based on their affinity to Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin. Claudins, a family of protein localized in tight junctions, are essential for the control of paracellular permeation in epithelia and endothelia. The interaction of several claudins with Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) has been exploited for an affinity-based enrichment of CPE-binding claudins from lysates of normal rat cholangiocytes. Immunoblotting and mass spectrometry (MS) experiments demonstrate strong enrichment of the CPE-binding claudins -3, -4 and -7, indicating specific association with glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-CPE(116-319) fusion protein. In parallel, the co-elution of (non-CPE-binding) claudin-1 and claudin-5 was observed. The complete set of co-enriched proteins was identified by MS after electrophoretic separation. Relative mass spectrometric protein quantification with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) made it possible to discriminate specific binding from non-specific association to GST and/or matrix material. CPE(116-319) provides an efficient tool for single step enrichment of different claudins from cell lysates. Numerous proteins were shown to be co-enriched with the CPE-binding claudins, but there are no indications (except for claudins -1 and -5) for an association with tight junctions.
1 The Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics. The Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics (CESG) is a "specialized" or "technology development" center supported by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI). CESG's mission is to develop improved methods for the high-throughput solution of structures from eukaryotic proteins, with a very strong weighting toward human proteins of biomedical relevance. During the first three years of PSI-2, CESG selected targets representing 601 proteins from Homo sapiens, 33 from mouse, 10 from rat, 139 from Galdieria sulphuraria, 35 from Arabidopsis thaliana, 96 from Cyanidioschyzon merolae, 80 from Plasmodium falciparum, 24 from yeast, and about 25 from other eukaryotes. Notably, 30% of all structures of human proteins solved by the PSI Centers were determined at CESG. Whereas eukaryotic proteins generally are considered to be much more challenging targets than prokaryotic proteins, the technology now in place at CESG yields success rates that are comparable to those of the large production centers that work primarily on prokaryotic proteins. We describe here the technological innovations that underlie CESG's platforms for bioinformatics and laboratory information management, target selection, protein production, and structure determination by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy.
3 Self-reported exposure to second-hand smoke and positive urinary cotinine in pregnant nonsmokers. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the association between self-reported exposure status to second-hand smoke and urinary cotinine level in pregnant nonsmokers. We recruited pregnant nonsmokers from the prenatal care clinics of a university hospital and two community health centers, and their urinary cotinine concentrations were measured. Among a total of 412 pregnant nonsmokers, the proportions of self-reported exposure to second-hand smoke and positive urinary cotinine level were 60.4% and 3.4%, respectively. Among those, 4.8% of the participants who reported exposure to second-hand smoke had cotinine levels of 40 ng/mL (the kappa value = 0.029, p = 0.049). Among those who reported living with smokers (n = 170), "smoking currently permitted in the whole house" (vs. not permitted at home) was associated with positive urinary cotinine in the univariable analysis. Furthermore, this variable showed a significant association with positive urinary cotinine in the stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis [Odds ratio (OR), 15.6; 95% Confidence interval (CI) = 2.1-115.4]. In the current study, the association between self-reported exposure status to second-hand smoke and positive urinary cotinine in pregnant nonsmokers was poor. "Smoking currently permitted in the whole house" was a significant factor of positive urinary cotinine in pregnant nonsmokers. Furthermore, we suggest that a complete smoking ban at home should be considered to avoid potential adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes due to second-hand smoke.
3 Synaptically evoked glutamate transporter currents in Spinal Dorsal Horn Astrocytes. Removing and sequestering synaptically released glutamate from the extracellular space is carried out by specific plasma membrane transporters that are primarily located in astrocytes. Glial glutamate transporter function can be monitored by recording the currents that are produced by co-transportation of Na+ ions with the uptake of glutamate. The goal of this study was to characterize glutamate transporter function in astrocytes of the spinal cord dorsal horn in real time by recording synaptically evoked glutamate transporter currents. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from astrocytes in the spinal substantia gelatinosa (SG) area in spinal slices of young adult rats. Glutamate transporter currents were evoked in these cells by electrical stimulation at the spinal dorsal root entry zone in the presence of bicuculline, strychnine, DNQX and D-AP5. Transporter currents were abolished when synaptic transmission was blocked by TTX or Cd2+. Pharmacological studies identified two subtypes of glutamate transporters in spinal astrocytes, GLAST and GLT-1. Glutamate transporter currents were graded with stimulus intensity, reaching peak responses at 4 to 5 times activation threshold, but were reduced following low-frequency (0.1 - 1 Hz) repetitive stimulation. These results suggest that glutamate transporters of spinal astrocytes could be activated by synaptic activation, and recording glutamate transporter currents may provide a means of examining the real time physiological responses of glial cells in spinal sensory processing, sensitization, hyperalgesia and chronic pain.
1 Interleukin 7 signaling in dendritic cells regulates the homeostatic proliferation and niche size of CD4+ T cells. Interleukin 7 (IL-7) and T cell antigen receptor signals have been proposed to be the main drivers of homeostatic T cell proliferation. However, it is not known why CD4(+) T cells undergo less-efficient homeostatic proliferation than CD8(+) T cells do. Here we show that systemic IL-7 concentrations increased during lymphopenia because of diminished use of IL-7 but that IL-7 signaling on IL-7 receptor-alpha-positive (IL-7Ralpha(+)) dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphopenic settings paradoxically diminished the homeostatic proliferation of CD4(+) T cells. This effect was mediated at least in part by IL-7-mediated downregulation of the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II on IL-7Ralpha(+) DCs. Our results indicate that IL-7Ralpha(+) DCs are regulators of the peripheral CD4(+) T cell niche and that IL-7 signals in DCs prevent uncontrolled CD4(+) T cell population expansion in vivo.
2 Remission of invasive, cancer stem-like glioblastoma xenografts using lentiviral vector-mediated suicide gene therapy. Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most malignant primary brain tumor with a poor prognosis. The translation of therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma from the experimental phase into the clinic has been limited by insufficient animal models, which lack important features of human tumors. Lentiviral gene therapy is an attractive therapeutic option for human glioblastoma, which we validated in a clinically relevant animal model. We used a rodent xenograft model that recapitulates the invasive and angiogenic features of human glioblastoma to analyze the transduction pattern and therapeutic efficacy of lentiviral pseudotyped vectors. Both, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein (LCMV-GP) and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors very efficiently transduced human glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, pseudotyped gammaretroviral vectors, similar to those evaluated for clinical therapy of glioblastoma, showed inefficient gene transfer in vitro and in vivo. Both pseudotyped lentiviral vectors transduced cancer stem-like cells characterized by their CD133-, nestin- and SOX2-expression, the ability to form spheroids in neural stem cell medium and to express astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers under serum conditions. In a therapeutic approach using the suicide gene herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-1-tk) fused to eGFP, both lentiviral vectors mediated a complete remission of solid tumors as seen on MRI resulting in a highly significant survival benefit (p<0.001) compared to control groups. In all recurrent tumors, surviving eGFP-positive tumor cells were found, advocating prodrug application for several cycles to even enhance and prolong the therapeutic effect. In conclusion, lentiviral pseudotyped vectors are promising candidates for gene therapy of glioma in patients. The inefficient gene delivery by gammaretroviral vectors is in line with the results obtained in clinical therapy for GBM and thus confirms the high reproducibility of the invasive glioma animal model for translational research.
3 Integration of IRF6 and Jagged2 signalling is essential for controlling palatal adhesion and fusion competence. In mammals, adhesion and fusion of the palatal shelves are essential mechanisms during the development of the secondary palate; failure of these processes leads to the congenital anomaly, cleft palate. The mechanisms that prevent pathological adhesion between the oral and palatal epithelia while permitting adhesion and subsequent fusion of the palatal shelves via their medial edge epithelia remain obscure. In humans, mutations in the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) underlie Van der Woude syndrome and popliteal pterygium syndrome. Recently, we have demonstrated that mice homozygous for a mutation in Irf6 exhibit abnormalities of epithelial differentiation that results in cleft palate as a consequence of adhesion between the palatal shelves and the tongue. In the current paper, we demonstrate that Irf6 is essential for oral epithelial differentiation and that IRF6 and the Notch ligand Jagged2 function in convergent molecular pathways during this process. We further demonstrate that IRF6 plays a key role in the formation and maintenance of the oral periderm, spatio-temporal regulation of which is essential for ensuring appropriate palatal adhesion.
3 Male-produced aggregation pheromones of the cerambycid beetles Xylotrechus colonus and Sarosesthes fulminans. Adults of both sexes of the cerambycid beetles Xylotrechus colonus (F.) and Sarosesthes fulminans (F.) were attracted to odors produced by male conspecifics in olfactometer bioassays. Analyses of headspace volatiles from adults revealed that male X. colonus produced a blend of (R)- and (S)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one and (2 S,3 S)- and (2R,3R)-2,3-hexanediol, whereas male S. fulminans produced (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one and (2 S,3R)-2,3-hexanediol. All of these compounds were absent in the headspace of females. Two field bioassays were conducted to confirm the biological activity of the synthesized pheromones: (1) enantiomerically enriched pheromone components were tested singly and in species-specific blends and (2) four-component mixture of racemic 3-hydroxyhexan-2-one plus racemic 2-hydroxyhexan-3-one and the four-component blend of the stereoisomers of 2,3-hexanediols were tested separately and as a combined eight-component blend. In these experiments, adult male and female X. colonus were captured in greatest numbers in traps baited with the reconstructed blend of components produced by males, although significant numbers were also captured in traps baited with (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one alone or in blends with other compounds. Too few adult S. fulminans were captured for a statistical comparison among treatments, but all were caught in traps baited with lures containing (R)-3-hydroxyhexan-2-one. In addition to these two species, adults of two other species of cerambycid beetles, for which pheromones had previously been identified, were caught: Neoclytus a. acuminatus (F.) and its congener Neoclytus m. mucronatus (F.). Cross-attraction of beetles to pheromone blends of other species, and to individual pheromone components that are shared by two or more sympatric species, may facilitate location of larval hosts by species that compete for the same host species.
3 Institutional shared resources and translational cancer research. The development and maintenance of adequate shared infrastructures is considered a major goal for academic centers promoting translational research programs. Among infrastructures favoring translational research, centralized facilities characterized by shared, multidisciplinary use of expensive laboratory instrumentation, or by complex computer hardware and software and/or by high professional skills are necessary to maintain or improve institutional scientific competitiveness. The success or failure of a shared resource program also depends on the choice of appropriate institutional policies and requires an effective institutional governance regarding decisions on staffing, existence and composition of advisory committees, policies and of defined mechanisms of reporting, budgeting and financial support of each resource. Shared Resources represent a widely diffused model to sustain cancer research; in fact, web sites from an impressive number of research Institutes and Universities in the U.S. contain pages dedicated to the SR that have been established in each Center, making a complete view of the situation impossible. However, a nation-wide overview of how Cancer Centers develop SR programs is available on the web site for NCI-designated Cancer Centers in the U.S., while in Europe, information is available for individual Cancer centers. This article will briefly summarize the institutional policies, the organizational needs, the characteristics, scientific aims, and future developments of SRs necessary to develop effective translational research programs in oncology.In fact, the physical build-up of SRs per se is not sufficient for the successful translation of biomedical research. Appropriate policies to improve the academic culture in collaboration, the availability of educational programs for translational investigators, the existence of administrative facilitations for translational research and an efficient organization supporting clinical trial recruitment and management represent essential tools, providing solutions to overcome existing barriers in the development of translational research in biomedical research centers.
0 Is there any treatment other than drugs to alleviate dyspnea in COPD patients? Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are often limited in their activities by breathlessness. In these patients, exercise training may result in significant improvements in dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Further possibilities are to reduce ventilatory demand by decreasing the central respiratory drive or to lessen the perceived breathing effort by increasing respiratory muscle strength through specific respiratory muscle training. Upper limb training may also improve exercise capacity and symptoms in these patients through the modulation of dynamic hyperinflation. Ventilatory assistance during exercise reduces dyspnea and work of breathing and enhances exercise tolerance, although further studies should be required to define their applicability in the routine pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Lung volume resection surgery and lung transplantation in selected patients may control symptoms and improve HRQoL.
1 Biological effects and safety in magnetic resonance imaging: a review. Since the introduction of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic technique, the number of people exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMF) has increased dramatically. In this review, based on the results of a pioneer study showing in vitro and in vivo genotoxic effects of MRI scans, we report an updated survey about the effects of non-ionizing EMF employed in MRI, relevant for patients' and workers' safety. While the whole data does not confirm a risk hypothesis, it suggests a need for further studies and prudent use in order to avoid unnecessary examinations, according to the precautionary principle.
0 A standardized framework for accurate, high-throughput genotyping of recombinant and non-recombinant viral sequences. Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis B and C and other rapidly evolving viruses are characterized by extremely high levels of genetic diversity. To facilitate diagnosis and the development of prevention and treatment strategies that efficiently target the diversity of these viruses, and other pathogens such as human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), human herpes virus type-8 (HHV8) and human papillomavirus (HPV), we developed a rapid high-throughput-genotyping system. The method involves the alignment of a query sequence with a carefully selected set of pre-defined reference strains, followed by phylogenetic analysis of multiple overlapping segments of the alignment using a sliding window. Each segment of the query sequence is assigned the genotype and sub-genotype of the reference strain with the highest bootstrap (>70%) and bootscanning (>90%) scores. Results from all windows are combined and displayed graphically using color-coded genotypes. The new Virus-Genotyping Tools provide accurate classification of recombinant and non-recombinant viruses and are currently being assessed for their diagnostic utility. They have incorporated into several HIV drug resistance algorithms including the Stanford (http://hivdb.stanford.edu) and two European databases (http://www.umcutrecht.nl/subsite/spread-programme/ and http://www.hivrdb.org.uk/) and have been successfully used to genotype a large number of sequences in these and other databases. The tools are a PHP/JAVA web application and are freely accessible on a number of servers including: http://bioafrica.mrc.ac.za/rega-genotype/html/, http://lasp.cpqgm.fiocruz.br/virus-genotype/html/, http://jose.med.kuleuven.be/genotypetool/html/.
2 Estimation of energy requirements for mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients using nutritional status. There is very little information on what is considered an adequate energy intake for mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients. The purpose of the present study was to determine this energy requirement by making use of patients' nutritional status. The study was conducted in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit of Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan. Patients were hemodynamically stable and not comatose, and were requiring at least 7 days of mechanical ventilation. Fifty-four patients successfully completed this study. The resting energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry. The total energy requirement was considered 120% of the measured energy expenditure. The daily nutrient intake was recorded. Nutritional status was assessed using single and multiple parameters, nitrogen balance, and medical records, and was performed within 24 hours of admission and after 7 days in the intensive care unit. Fifteen patients were being underfed (<90% of total energy requirement), 20 patients were in the appropriate feeding (AF) group (within +/- 10% of total energy requirement), and 19 patients received overfeeding (>110% of total energy requirement). Patients in the underfeeding group received only 68.3% of their energy requirement, while the overfeeding group patients received up to 136.5% of their required calories. Only patients in the AF group had a positive nitrogen balance (0.04 +/- 5.1) on day 7. AF group patients had a significantly higher Nutritional Risk Index value at day 7 than at day 1. AF patients had more improvement in nutritional status than patients in the other feeding groups. To provide at least 120% of the resting energy expenditure seemed adequate to meet the caloric energy needs of hemodynamically stable, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients.
3 An imbalance between apoptosis and proliferation contributes to follicular persistence in polycystic ovaries in rats. Cystic ovarian disease is an important cause of infertility that affects bovine, ovine, caprine and porcine species and even human beings. Alterations in the ovarian micro-environment of females with follicular cysts could alter the normal processes of proliferation and programmed cell death in ovarian cells. Thus, our objective was to evaluate apoptosis and proliferation in ovarian cystic follicles in rats in order to investigate the cause of cystic follicle formation and persistence. We compared the number of in situ apoptotic cells by TUNEL assay, expression of active caspase-3 and members of Bcl-2 family by immunohistochemistry; and cell proliferation by the expression of the proliferation markers: PCNA and Ki-67. The proliferation index was low in granulosa of tertiary and cystic follicles of light exposed rats when compared with tertiary follicles of control animals, while in theca interna only cystic follicles presented low proliferation index when compared with tertiary follicles (p < 0.05). The granulosa of cysts exhibited a similar cell DNA fragmentation to early atretic follicles. In the granulosa and theca interna, active caspase-3 shown similar immunostaining levels in tertiary and cystic follicles (p < 0.05). The granulosa cells presented high expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w in the tertiary and cystic follicles with diminishing intensity in the atretic follicles, except with Bcl-w where the intensity was maintained in the atretic follicles (p < 0.05). The expression of Bax was weak in the healthy and cystic follicles. In the theca interna, Bcl-2 expression was the same as the pattern found in the granulosa; no differences were found between tertiary and cystic follicles from both groups for Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. The expression of Bax in this layer was higher in the tertiary follicles of the treated animals (p < 0.05) while the values for cystic follicles were similar to those in the tertiary follicles of controls. The theca externa showed low expression of the pro and anti-apoptotic proteins. These results show that the combination of weak proliferation indices and low apoptosis observed in follicular cysts, could explain the cause of the slow growth of cystic follicles and the maintenance of a static condition without degeneration, which leads to their persistence. These alterations may be due to structural and functional modifications that take place in these cells and could be related to hormonal changes in animals with this condition.
3 Involvement of Basal Ganglia network in motor disabilities induced by typical antipsychotics. Clinical treatments with typical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) are accompanied by extrapyramidal motor side-effects (EPS) such as hypokinesia and catalepsy. As little is known about electrophysiological substrates of such motor disturbances, we investigated the effects of a typical APD, alpha-flupentixol, on the motor behavior and the neuronal activity of the whole basal ganglia nuclei in the rat. The motor behavior was examined by the open field actimeter and the neuronal activity of basal ganglia nuclei was investigated using extracellular single unit recordings on urethane anesthetized rats. We show that alpha-flupentixol induced EPS paralleled by a decrease in the firing rate and a disorganization of the firing pattern in both substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Furthermore, alpha-flupentixol induced an increase in the firing rate of globus pallidus (GP) neurons. In the striatum, we recorded two populations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) after their antidromic identification. At basal level, both striato-pallidal and striato-nigral MSNs were found to be unaffected by alpha-flupentixol. However, during electrical cortico-striatal activation only striato-pallidal, but not striato-nigral, MSNs were found to be inhibited by alpha-flupentixol. Together, our results suggest that the changes in STN and SNr neuronal activity are a consequence of increased neuronal activity of globus pallidus (GP). Indeed, after selective GP lesion, alpha-flupentixol failed to induce EPS and to alter STN neuronal activity. Our study reports strong evidence to show that hypokinesia and catalepsy induced by alpha-flupentixol are triggered by dramatic changes occurring in basal ganglia network. We provide new insight into the key role of GP in the pathophysiology of APD-induced EPS suggesting that the GP can be considered as a potential target for the treatment of EPS.
1 Effect of heart rate and body mass index on the interscan and interobserver variability of coronary artery calcium scoring at prospective ECG-triggered 64-slice CT. To test the effects of heart rate, body mass index (BMI) and noise level on interscan and interobserver variability of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring on a prospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered 64-slice CT. One hundred and ten patients (76 patients with CAC) were scanned twice on prospective ECG-triggered scans. The scan parameters included 120 kV, 82 mAs, a 2.5 mm thickness, and an acquisition center at 45% of the RR interval. The interscan and interobserver variability on the CAC scores (Agatston, volume, and mass) was calculated. The factors affecting the variability were determined by plotting it against heart rate, BMI, and noise level (defined as the standard deviation: SD). The estimated effective dose was 1.5 +/- 0.2 mSv. The mean heart rate was 63 +/- 12 bpm (range, 44-101 bpm). The patient BMIs were 24.5 +/- 4.5 kg/m(2) (range, 15.5-42.3 kg/m(2)). The mean and median interscan variabilities were 11% and 6%, respectively by volume, and 11% and 6%, respectively, by mass. Moreover, the mean and median of the algorithms were lower than the Agatston algorithm (16% and 9%, respectively). The mean and median interobserver variability was 10% and 4%, respectively (average of algorithms). The mean noise levels were 15 +/- 4 Hounsfield unit (HU) (range, 8-25 HU). The interscan and interobserver variability was not correlated with heart rate, BMI, or noise level. The interscan and interobserver variability of CAC on a prospective ECG-triggered 64-slice CT with high image quality and 45% of RR acquisition is not significantly affected by heart rate, BMI, or noise level. The volume or mass algorithms show reduced interscan variability compared to the Agatston scoring (p < 0.05).
3 Brief, low frequency stimulation of rat peripheral C-fibres evokes prolonged microglial-induced central sensitization in adults but not in neonates. The sensitization of spinal dorsal horn neurones leads to prolonged enhancement of pain behaviour and can be evoked by intense C-fibre stimulation, tissue inflammation and peripheral nerve injury. Activation of central immune cells plays a key role in establishing pain hypersensitivity but the exact nature of the afferent input that triggers the activation of microglia and other glial cells within the CNS, remains unclear. Here intense but non-damaging, electrical stimulation of intact adult rat C-fibres for 5 min at 10 Hz induced central sensitization characterized by significant decreases in mechanical withdrawal thresholds 3, 24 and 48 h later. This maintained (>3 h) hypersensitivity was not observed following topical skin application of capsaicin. C-fibre evoked sensitization was accompanied by significant microglial activation, shown by increased Iba-1 immunoreactivity throughout the dorsal horn at 24 and 48 h and significant upregulation of markers of microglial activation: IL-6 and Mcp-1 at 3h and Mmp3, CSF-1 and CD163 at 24 and 48 h. C-fibre stimulation caused no nerve damage at ultrastructural and molecular levels. Lower intensity stimulation that did not activate C-fibres or sham stimulation did not increase Iba-1 immunoreactivity or induce behavioural sensitivity. Pre-treatment with minocycline (40 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented the C-fibre evoked sensitization and microglial activation. Identical C-fibre stimulation in 10-day old rat pups failed to activate microglia or change behaviour. These results demonstrate that a brief period of low frequency C-fibre stimulation, in the absence of nerve damage, is sufficient to activate microglia resulting in behavioural hyperalgesia.
3 Cyclophilin A enhances vascular oxidative stress and the development of angiotensin II-induced aortic aneurysms. Inflammation and oxidative stress are pathogenic mediators of many diseases, but molecules that could be therapeutic targets remain elusive. Inflammation and matrix degradation in the vasculature are crucial for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation. Cyclophilin A (CypA, encoded by Ppia) is highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), is secreted in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promotes inflammation. Using the angiotensin II (AngII)-induced AAA model in Apoe-/- mice, we show that Apoe-/-Ppia-/- mice are completely protected from AngII-induced AAA formation, in contrast to Apoe-/-Ppia+/+ mice. Apoe-/-Ppia-/- mice show decreased inflammatory cytokine expression, elastic lamina degradation and aortic expansion. These features were not altered by reconstitution of bone marrow cells from Ppia+/+ mice. Mechanistic studies showed that VSMC-derived intracellular and extracellular CypA are required for ROS generation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation. These data define a previously undescribed role for CypA in AAA formation and suggest CypA as a new target for treating cardiovascular disease.
0 C-type lectins and phagocytosis. To recognise and respond to pathogens, germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) bind to conserved microbial structures and activate host defence systems, including microbial uptake by phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is a complex process that is instrumental in the control of extracellular pathogens, and this activity is mediated by several PRRs, including a number of C-type lectins. While some of these receptors have clearly been shown to mediate or regulate the uptake of pathogens, others are more contentious and are less well understood in terms of their phagocytic potential. Furthermore, very little is known about the underlying phagocytic mechanisms. Here, we review the phagocytic roles of the mannose receptor, Dectin-1, dendritic cell-specific ICAM grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), DCL-1, mannose binding lectin and surfactant proteins A and D.
0 A novel in vivo murine model of cartilage regeneration. Age and strain-dependent outcome after joint surface injury. To generate and validate a murine model of joint surface repair following acute mechanical injury. Full thickness defects were generated in the patellar groove of C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice by microsurgery. Control knees were either sham-operated or non-operated. Outcome was evaluated by histological scoring systems. Apoptosis and proliferation were studied using TUNEL and Phospho-Histone H3 staining, respectively. Type II collagen neo-deposition and degradation were evaluated by immunostaining using antibodies to the CPII telopeptide and C1,2C (Col2-3/4Cshort), respectively. Aggrecanases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity were assessed by immunostaining for TEGE(373) and VDIPEN neo-epitopes. Young 8-week-old DBA/1 mice displayed consistent and superior healing of the articular cartilage defect. Age-matched C57BL/6 mice repaired poorly and developed features of osteoarthritis (OA). Compared to C57BL/6, DBA/1 mice displayed a progressive decline of chondrocyte apoptosis, cell proliferation within the repair tissue, persistent type II collagen neo-deposition, less type II collagen degradation, less aggrecanases and more MMP-induced aggrecan degradation. Eight-month-old DBA/1 mice failed to repair, but, in contrast to age-matched C57BL/6 mice, developed no signs of OA. We have generated and validated a murine model of cartilage regeneration in which the outcome of joint surface injury is strain and age dependent. This model will allow, for the first time, the dissection of different pathways involved in joint surface regeneration in adult mammals using the powerful technology of mouse genetics.
3 Beyond marine reserves: exploring the approach of selecting areas where fishing is permitted, rather than prohibited. Marine populations have been declining at a worrying rate, due in large part to fishing pressures. The challenge is to secure a future for marine life while minimizing impacts on fishers and fishing communities. Rather than selecting areas where fishing is banned -- as is usually the case with spatial management -- we assess the concept of designating areas where fishing is permitted. We use spatial catch statistics for thirteen commercial fisheries on Canada's west coast to determine the minimum area that would be needed to maintain a pre-ascribed target percentage of current catches. We found that small reductions in fisheries yields, if strategically allocated, could result in large unfished areas that are representative of biophysical regions and habitat types, and have the potential to achieve remarkable conservation gains. Our approach of selecting fishing areas instead of reserves could help redirect debate about the relative values that society places on conservation and extraction, in a framework that could gain much by losing little. Our ideas are intended to promote discussions about the current status quo in fisheries management, rather than providing a definitive solution.
1 High-intensity-focused ultrasound in the treatment of primary prostate cancer: the first UK series. The use of minimally invasive ablative therapies in localised prostate cancer offer potential for a middle ground between active surveillance and radical therapy. An analysis of men with organ-confined prostate cancer treated with transrectal whole-gland HIFU (Sonablate 500) between 1 February 2005 and 15 May 2007 was carried out in two centres. Outcome data (side-effects using validated patient questionnaires, biochemical, histology) were evaluated. A total of 172 men were treated under general anaesthetic as day-case procedures with 78% discharged a mean 5 h after treatment. Mean follow-up was 346 days (range 135-759 days). Urethral stricture was significantly lower in those with suprapubic catheter compared with urethral catheters (19.4 vs 40.4%, P=0.005). Antibiotics were given to 23.8% of patients for presumed urinary tract infection and the rate of epididymitis was 7.6%. Potency was maintained in 70% by 12 months, whereas mild stress urinary incontinence (no pads) was reported in 7.0% (12 out of 172) with a further 0.6% (1 out of 172) requiring pads. There was no rectal toxicity and no recto-urethral fistulae. In all, 78.3% achieved a PSA nadir < or =0.5 microg ml(-1) at 12 months, with 57.8% achieving < or =0.2 microg ml(-1). Then, 8 out of 13 were retreated with HIFU, one had salvage external beam radiotherapy and four chose active surveillance for small-volume low-risk disease. Overall, there was no evidence of disease (PSA <0.5 microg ml(-1) or negative biopsy if nadir not achieved) after one HIFU session in 92.4% (159 out of 172) of patients. HIFU is a minimally invasive, day-case ablative technique that can achieve good biochemical outcomes in the short term with minimal urinary incontinence and acceptable levels of erectile dysfunction. Long-term outcome needs further evaluation and the inception of an international registry for cases treated using HIFU will significantly aid this health technology assessment.
1 Prevalence of transcription promoters within archaeal operons and coding sequences. Despite the knowledge of complex prokaryotic-transcription mechanisms, generalized rules, such as the simplified organization of genes into operons with well-defined promoters and terminators, have had a significant role in systems analysis of regulatory logic in both bacteria and archaea. Here, we have investigated the prevalence of alternate regulatory mechanisms through genome-wide characterization of transcript structures of approximately 64% of all genes, including putative non-coding RNAs in Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1. Our integrative analysis of transcriptome dynamics and protein-DNA interaction data sets showed widespread environment-dependent modulation of operon architectures, transcription initiation and termination inside coding sequences, and extensive overlap in 3' ends of transcripts for many convergently transcribed genes. A significant fraction of these alternate transcriptional events correlate to binding locations of 11 transcription factors and regulators (TFs) inside operons and annotated genes-events usually considered spurious or non-functional. Using experimental validation, we illustrate the prevalence of overlapping genomic signals in archaeal transcription, casting doubt on the general perception of rigid boundaries between coding sequences and regulatory elements.
0 A Judd illusion in far-aiming: evidence of a contribution to action by vision for perception. The present study addresses the role of vision for perception in determining the location of a target in far-aiming. Participants (N = 12) slid a disk toward a distant target embedded in illusory Judd figures. Additionally, in a perception task, participants indicated when a moving pointer reached the midpoint of the Judd figures. The number of hits, the number of misses to the left and to the right of the target, the sliding error (in mm) and perceptual judgment error (in mm) served as dependent variables. Results showed an illusory bias in sliding, the magnitude of which was comparable to the bias in the perception of target location. The determination of target location in far-aiming is thus based on relative metrics. We argue that vision for perception sets the boundary constraints for action and that within these constraints vision for action autonomously controls movement execution, but alternative accounts are discussed as well.
1 Health-related quality of life and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with and without complications. The goal of antihypertensive treatment is to reduce blood pressure without interfering in health-related quality of life (HRQL) OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the influence of hypertension control upon HRQL in hypertensive patients with and without complications. Seventy-seven hypertensive outpatients (71% women, 58% white, 60% with elementary school level education, average age 54 +/- 8 years) were observed during a 12-month special care program (phase 1: clinical visits every two months, donation of all antihypertensive medications, meetings with a multidisciplinary team, and active telephone calls) and three years of standard care (phase 2: clinical visits every four months, medication provided by the drugstore of the hospital with a two-hour wait and a possible lack of medication, no meetings with a multidisciplinary team or active telephone calls). The patient HRQL was assessed using Bulpitt and Fletcher's Specific Questionnaire, as well as the SF-36 scores. Hypertensive patients were divided into "with complications" (n=37, diastolic blood pressure great than 110 mm Hg for patients with or without treatment, with clinically evident target-organ or other associated illness) and "without complications" (n=40). The variables studied were quality of life, blood pressure control, hypertension gravity, and demographic characteristics. In hypertensive patients with and without complications, both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher (p<0.05) in phase 2 of observation (143+/-18/84+/-11 and 144+/-21/93+/-11 mm Hg for patients with and without complications, respectively) relative to phase 1 (128+/-17/75+/-13 and 128+/-15/83+/-11 mm Hg). The proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure (defined as a blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg) decreased from 70% to 49% in the "with complications" group and from 78% to 50% in the "without complications" group during phase 2 of observation. The patients with complications showed a decrease in bodily pain, vitality, and mental health component summary scores in both phases. In phase 2, the patients without complications had significantly better HRQL scores compared to complicated patients using both the Bulpitt and Fletcher's Questionnaire and the SF-36 assessment of physical capacity, bodily pain, and vitality domain summary scores. With regards to hypertension control, there was a significant decrease from phase 1 to phase 2 in the vitality component summary scores and an increase in the emotional aspect component summary scores assessed by the SF-36, whereas Bulpitt and Fletcher's Questionnaire showed no differences in these scores. Special care programs with multidisciplinary activities, individualized and personalized assistance, easy access to pharmacological treatment, frequent meetings, and active telephone calls for hypertensive patients significantly increase blood pressure control but do not interfere with the HRQL.
3 Immunophenotypic lymphocyte profiles in human african trypanosomiasis. Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a deadly vector-born disease caused by an extracellular parasite, the trypanosome. Little is known about the cellular immune responses elicited by this parasite in humans. We used multiparameter flow cytometry to characterize leukocyte immunophenotypes in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 33 HAT patients and 27 healthy controls identified during a screening campaign in Angola and Gabon. We evaluated the subsets and activation markers of B and T lymphocytes. Patients had a higher percentage of CD19+ B lymphocytes and activated B lymphocytes in the blood than did controls, but lacked activated CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD25+). Patients displayed no increase in the percentage of activated CD8+ T cells (HLA-DR+, CD69+ or CD25+), but memory CD8 T-cell levels (CD8+CD45RA2) were significantly lower in patients than in controls, as were effector CD8 T-cell levels (CD8+CD45RA+CD62L2). No relationship was found between these blood immunophenotypes and disease severity (stage 1 vs 2). However, CD19+ B-cell levels in the CSF increased with disease severity. The patterns of T and B cell activation in HAT patients suggest that immunomodulatory mechanisms may operate during infection. Determinations of CD19+ B-cell levels in the CSF could improve disease staging.
1 Capturing real-life patient care in psoriatic arthritis and its risks: the challenge of analysing registry data. Studies based on registries continue to inform us of many relevant issues in the treatment of arthritic conditions and constitute more than just a supplement of clinical trial data. We can learn about long-term aspects of therapies beyond the scope of most clinical trials and about larger-scale toxicity. The downsides need to be considered in the interpretation of the results and include mainly the biases that are inherent when routine clinical practice is just observed and not steered by a protocol. However, using steered protocols in practice not only would facilitate post hoc analyses of clinical effectiveness, but (as we have learned from research in rheumatoid arthritis) can also improve outcomes of our patients.
1 PathExpress update: the enzyme neighbourhood method of associating gene-expression data with metabolic pathways. The post-genomic era presents us with the challenge of linking the vast amount of raw data obtained with transcriptomic and proteomic techniques to relevant biological pathways. We present an update of PathExpress, a web-based tool to interpret gene-expression data and explore the metabolic network without being restricted to predefined pathways. We define the Enzyme Neighbourhood (EN) as a sub-network of linked enzymes with a limited path length to identify the most relevant sub-networks affected in gene-expression experiments. PathExpress is freely available at: http://bioinfoserver.rsbs.anu.edu.au/utils/PathExpress/.
0 Dissociated fear and spatial learning in mice with deficiency of ataxin-2. Mouse models with physiological and behavioral differences attributable to differential plasticity of hippocampal and amygdalar neuronal networks are rare. We previously generated ataxin-2 (Atxn2) knockout mice and demonstrated that these animals lacked obvious anatomical abnormalities of the CNS, but showed marked obesity and reduced fertility. We now report on behavioral changes as a consequence of Atxn2-deficiency. Atxn2-deficiency was associated with impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in the amygdala, but normal LTP in the hippocampus. Intact hippocampal plasticity was associated behaviorally with normal Morris Water maze testing. Impaired amygdala plasticity was associated with reduced cued and contextual fear conditioning. Conditioned taste aversion, however, was normal. In addition, knockout mice showed decreased innate fear in several tests and motor hyperactivity in open cage testing. Our results suggest that Atxn2-deficiency results in a specific set of behavioral and cellular disturbances that include motor hyperactivity and abnormal fear-related behaviors, but intact hippocampal function. This animal model may be useful for the study of anxiety disorders and should encourage studies of anxiety in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2).
3 Dynamic telomerase gene suppression via network effects of GSK3 inhibition. Telomerase controls telomere homeostasis and cell immortality and is a promising anti-cancer target, but few small molecule telomerase inhibitors have been developed. Reactivated transcription of the catalytic subunit hTERT in cancer cells controls telomerase expression. Better understanding of upstream pathways is critical for effective anti-telomerase therapeutics and may reveal new targets to inhibit hTERT expression. In a focused promoter screen, several GSK3 inhibitors suppressed hTERT reporter activity. GSK3 inhibition using 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime suppressed hTERT expression, telomerase activity and telomere length in several cancer cell lines and growth and hTERT expression in ovarian cancer xenografts. Microarray analysis, network modelling and oligonucleotide binding assays suggested that multiple transcription factors were affected. Extensive remodelling involving Sp1, STAT3, c-Myc, NFkappaB, and p53 occurred at the endogenous hTERT promoter. RNAi screening of the hTERT promoter revealed multiple kinase genes which affect the hTERT promoter, potentially acting through these factors. Prolonged inhibitor treatments caused dynamic expression both of hTERT and of c-Jun, p53, STAT3, AR and c-Myc. Our results indicate that GSK3 activates hTERT expression in cancer cells and contributes to telomere length homeostasis. GSK3 inhibition is a clinical strategy for several chronic diseases. These results imply that it may also be useful in cancer therapy. However, the complex network effects we show here have implications for either setting.
2 Mesenchymal stem cells prevent the rejection of fully allogenic islet grafts by the immunosuppressive activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to be capable of suppressing immune responses, but the molecular mechanisms involved and the therapeutic potential of MSCs remain to be clarified. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secreted by MSCs, in particular MMP-2 and MMP-9, play an important role in the suppressive activity of MSCs by reducing surface expression of CD25 on responding T-cells. Blocking the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in vitro completely abolished the suppression of T-cell proliferation by MSCs and restored T-cell expression of CD25 as well as responsiveness to interleukin-2. In vivo, administration of MSCs significantly reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to allogeneic antigen and profoundly prolonged the survival of fully allogeneic islet grafts in transplant recipients. Significantly, these MSC-mediated protective effects were completely reversed by in vivo inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9. We demonstrate that MSCs can prevent islet allograft rejection leading to stable, long-term normoglycemia. In addition, we provide a novel insight into the mechanism underlying the suppressive effects of MSCs on T-cell responses to alloantigen.
0 Evolutionary processes acting on candidate cis-regulatory regions in humans inferred from patterns of polymorphism and divergence. Analysis of polymorphism and divergence in the non-coding portion of the human genome yields crucial information about factors driving the evolution of gene regulation. Candidate cis-regulatory regions spanning more than 15,000 genes in 15 African Americans and 20 European Americans were re-sequenced and aligned to the chimpanzee genome in order to identify potentially functional polymorphism and to characterize and quantify departures from neutral evolution. Distortions of the site frequency spectra suggest a general pattern of selective constraint on conserved non-coding sites in the flanking regions of genes (CNCs). Moreover, there is an excess of fixed differences that cannot be explained by a Gamma model of deleterious fitness effects, suggesting the presence of positive selection on CNCs. Extensions of the McDonald-Kreitman test identified candidate cis-regulatory regions with high probabilities of positive and negative selection near many known human genes, the biological characteristics of which exhibit genome-wide trends that differ from patterns observed in protein-coding regions. Notably, there is a higher probability of positive selection in candidate cis-regulatory regions near genes expressed in the fetal brain, suggesting that a larger portion of adaptive regulatory changes has occurred in genes expressed during brain development. Overall we find that natural selection has played an important role in the evolution of candidate cis-regulatory regions throughout hominid evolution.
1 Ultrasonographic findings in patients examined in cataract detection-and-treatment campaigns: a retrospective study. A cataract is defined as an opacity of any portion of the lens, regardless of visual acuity. In some advanced cases of cataracts, in which good fundus visualization is not possible, an ultrasound examination provides better assessment of the posterior segment of the globe. This study aims to evaluate the ultrasonographic records of patients with advanced cataracts who were examined during cataract campaigns. The ultrasonographic findings obtained from 215 patients examined in cataract campaigns conducted by the Hospital das Clínicas Department of Ophthalmology of the Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo between the years of 2005 and 2007 were evaluated, and the utility of this exam in changing the treatment procedures was studied. A total of 289 eyes from 215 patients were examined. Of the eyes examined, 77.5% presented with findings in the vitreous cavity and the posterior pole. A posterior vitreous detachment with no other complications was observed in 47.4% of the eyes. The remaining 30.1% presented with eye diseases that could result in a reduced visual function after surgery. The most frequent eye diseases observed were diffuse vitreous opacity (12.1% of the eyes) and detachment of the retina (9.3% of the eyes). In many cases, the ultrasonographic evaluation of the posterior segment revealed significant anomalies that changed the original treatment plan or contra-indicated surgery. At the very least, the evaluation was useful for patient counseling. The ultrasonographic examination revealed and differentiated between eyes with cataracts and eyes with ocular abnormalities other than cataracts as the cause of poor vision, thereby indicating the importance of its use during ocular evaluation.
1 Low radiation dose imaging of myocardial perfusion and coronary angiography with a hybrid PET/CT scanner. To test the image quality and feasibility of a sequential low radiation dose protocol for hybrid cardiac PET/CT angiography (CTA). Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a non-invasive method for coronary angiography. The negative predictive value of MDCT is high but perfusion imaging has a role in detecting functional significance of coronary lesions. This has encouraged combining these techniques. However, radiation dose is of concern. We report our first experiences with a low dose sequential CTA mode applicable to hybrid imaging. In the first phase, 10 consecutive cardiac MDCT angiographies were performed with spiral acquisition and compared in terms of image quality and dose with the following 10 patients performed with a new sequential mode. In the second phase, feasibility and radiation dose of a combined (15)O-water rest-stress PET perfusion/sequential CTA protocol were assessed in another group of 61 consecutive patients. Mean effective radiation dose was 60% lower in the sequential group than in the spiral group (19.3 versus 7.6 mSv, P<0.001). In the second phase, the new sequential hybrid protocol proved possible in 87% of the patients given the preconditions determined by the manufacturer. Mean effective dose of the CT acquisition was 7.6 mSv and total dose from the PET/CTA hybrid study 9.5 mSv. Low dose PET/CT allows cardiac hybrid studies with <10 mSv. The protocol can be applied to almost nine out of 10 patients with CT image quality comparable to spiral acquisition.
1 Dog ecology and demography in Antananarivo, 2007. Rabies is a widespread disease in African domestic dogs and a serious public health problem in developing countries. Canine rabies became established in Africa during the 20th century, coinciding with ecologic changes that favored its emergence in canids.This paper reports the results of a cross-sectional study of dog ecology in the Antananarivo urban community in Madagascar.A questionnaire survey of 1541 households was conducted in Antananarivo from October 2007 to January 2008. The study addressed both owned and unowned dogs. Various aspects of dog ecology were determined, including size of dog population, relationship between dogs and humans, rabies vaccination. Dog ownership was common, with 79.6 to 94.1% (mean 88.9%) of households in the six arrondissements owning dogs. The mean owned dog to person ratio was 1 dog per 4.5 persons and differed between arrondissements (administrative districts), with ratios of 1:6.0 in the first arrondissement, 1:3.2 persons in the 2nd, 1:4.8 in the 3rd, 1:5.2 in the 4th, 1:5.6 in the 5th and 1:4.4 in the 6th arrondissement. Overall, there were more male dogs (61.3%) and the male/female sex ratio was estimated to be 1.52; however, mature females were more likely than males to be unowned (OR: 1.93, CI 95%; 1.39<OR<2.69). Most (79.1%) owned dogs were never restricted and roamed freely to forage for food and mix with other dogs. Only a small proportion of dogs (11.7%) were fed with commercial dog food. Only 7.2% of owned dogs had certificates confirming vaccination against rabies. The proportion of vaccinated dogs varied widely between arrondissements (3.3% to 17.5%). Antananarivo has a higher density of dogs than many other urban areas in Africa. The dog population is unrestricted and inadequately vaccinated against rabies. This analysis of the dog population will enable targeted planning of rabies control efforts.
0 Structure-function analysis of nucleolin and ErbB receptors interactions. The ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases and nucleolin are major contributors to malignant transformation. Recently we have found that cell-surface ErbB receptors interact with nucleolin via their cytoplasmic tail. Overexpression of ErbB1 and nucleolin leads to receptor phosphorylation, dimerization and anchorage independent growth. In the present study we explored the regions of nucleolin and ErbB responsible for their interaction. Using mutational analyses, we addressed the structure-function relationship of the interaction between ErbB1 and nucleolin. We identified the ErbB1 nuclear localization domain as nucleolin interacting region. This region is important for nucleolin-associated receptor activation. Notably, though the tyrosine kinase domain is important for nucleolin-associated receptor activation, it is not involved in nucleolin/ErbB interactions. In addition, we demonstrated that the 212 c-terminal portion of nucleolin is imperative for the interaction with ErbB1 and ErbB4. This region of nucleolin is sufficient to induce ErbB1 dimerization, phosphorylation and growth in soft agar. The oncogenic potential of ErbB depends on receptor levels and activation. Nucleolin affects ErbB dimerization and activation leading to enhanced cell growth. The C-terminal region of nucleolin and the ErbB1 NLS-domain mediate this interaction. Moreover, when the C-terminal 212 amino acids region of nucleolin is expressed with ErbB1, it can enhance anchorage independent cell growth. Taken together these results offer new insight into the role of ErbB1 and nucleolin interaction in malignant cells.
1 Progression from beryllium exposure to chronic beryllium disease: an analytic model. Understanding the progression from beryllium exposure (BeE) to chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is essential for optimizing screening and early intervention to prevent CBD. We developed an analytic markov model of progression to cbd that assigns annual probabilities for progression through three states: from BeE to beryllium sensitization and then to CBD. We used calculations of the number in each state over time to assess which of several alternative progression models are most consistent with the limited available empirical data on prevalence and incidence. We estimated cost-effectiveness of screening considering both incremental (cost/case) and cumulative program costs. No combination of parameters for a simple model in which risk of progression remains constant over time can meet the empirical constraints of relatively frequent early cases and continuing development of new cases with long latencies. Modeling shows that the risk of progression is initially high and then declines over time. Also, it is likely that there are at least two populations that differ significantly in risk. The cost-effectiveness of repetitive screening declines over time, although new cases will still be found with long latencies. However, screening will be particularly cost-effective when applied to persons with long latencies who have not been previously screened. To optimize use of resources, the intensity of screening should decrease over time. Estimation of lifetime cumulative CBD risk should consider the declining risk of progression over time.
1 DDX11L: a novel transcript family emerging from human subtelomeric regions. The subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes exhibit an extraordinary plasticity. To date, due to the high GC content and to the presence of telomeric repeats, the subtelomeric sequences are underrepresented in the genomic libraries and consequently their sequences are incomplete in the finished human genome sequence, and still much remains to be learned about subtelomere organization, evolution and function. Indeed, only in recent years, several studies have disclosed, within human subtelomeres, novel gene family members. During a project aimed to analyze genes located in the telomeric region of the long arm of the human X chromosome, we have identified a novel transcript family, DDX11L, members of which map to 1pter, 2q13/14.1, 2qter, 3qter, 6pter, 9pter/9qter, 11pter, 12pter, 15qter, 16pter, 17pter, 19pter, 20pter/20qter, Xpter/Xqter and Yqter. Furthermore, we partially sequenced the underrepresented subtelomeres of human chromosomes showing a common evolutionary origin. Our data indicate that an ancestral gene, originated as a rearranged portion of the primate DDX11 gene, and propagated along many subtelomeric locations, is emerging within subtelomeres of human chromosomes, defining a novel gene family. These findings support the possibility that the high plasticity of these regions, sites of DNA exchange among different chromosomes, could trigger the emergence of new genes.
3 seeMotif: exploring and visualizing sequence motifs in 3D structures. Sequence motifs are important in the study of molecular biology. Motif discovery tools efficiently deliver many function related signatures of proteins and largely facilitate sequence annotation. As increasing numbers of motifs are detected experimentally or predicted computationally, characterizing the functional roles of motifs and identifying the potential synergetic relationships between them are important next steps. A good way to investigate novel motifs is to utilize the abundant 3D structures that have also been accumulated at an astounding rate in recent years. This article reports the development of the web service seeMotif, which provides users with an interactive interface for visualizing sequence motifs on protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Researchers can quickly see the locations and conformation of multiple motifs among a number of related structures simultaneously. Considering the fact that PDB sequences are usually shorter than those in sequence databases and/or may have missing residues, seeMotif has two complementary approaches for selecting structures and mapping motifs to protein chains in structures. As more and more structures belonging to previously uncharacterized protein families become available, combining sequence and structure information gives good opportunities to facilitate understanding of protein functions in large-scale genome projects.

3 Assessing the scientific research productivity of a Brazilian healthcare institution: a case study at the Heart Institute of São Paulo, Brazil. The present study was motivated by the need to systematically assess the research productivity of the Heart Institute (InCor), Medical School of the University of São Paulo, Brazil. To explore methodology for the assessment of institutional scientific research productivity. Bibliometric indicators based on searches for author affiliation of original scientific articles or reviews published in journals indexed in the databases Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and SciELO from January 2000 to December 2003 were used in this study. The retrieved records were analyzed according to the index parameters of the journals and modes of access. The number of citations was used to calculate the institutional impact factor. Out of 1253 records retrieved from the five databases, 604 original articles and reviews were analyzed; of these, 246 (41%) articles were published in national journals and 221 (90%) of those were in journals with free online access through SciELO or their own websites. Of the 358 articles published in international journals, 333 (93%) had controlled online access and 223 (67%) were available through the Capes Portal of Journals. The average impact of each article for InCor was 2.224 in the period studied. A simple and practical methodology to evaluate the scientific production of health research institutions includes searches in the LILACS database for national journals and in MEDLINE and the Web of Science for international journals. The institutional impact factor of articles indexed in the Web of Science may serve as a measure by which to assess and review the scientific productivity of a research institution.
2 A new view of radiation-induced cancer: integrating short- and long-term processes. Part II: second cancer risk estimation. As the number of cancer survivors grows, prediction of radiotherapy-induced second cancer risks becomes increasingly important. Because the latency period for solid tumors is long, the risks of recently introduced radiotherapy protocols are not yet directly measurable. In the accompanying article, we presented a new biologically based mathematical model, which, in principle, can estimate second cancer risks for any protocol. The novelty of the model is that it integrates, into a single formalism, mechanistic analyses of pre-malignant cell dynamics on two different time scales: short-term during radiotherapy and recovery; long-term during the entire life span. Here, we apply the model to nine solid cancer types (stomach, lung, colon, rectal, pancreatic, bladder, breast, central nervous system, and thyroid) using data on radiotherapy-induced second malignancies, on Japanese atomic bomb survivors, and on background US cancer incidence. Potentially, the model can be incorporated into radiotherapy treatment planning algorithms, adding second cancer risk as an optimization criterion.
0 Comorbid problems in ADHD: degree of association, shared endophenotypes, and formation of distinct subtypes. Implications for a future DSM. We aimed to assess which comorbid problems (oppositional defiant behaviors, anxiety, autistic traits, motor coordination problems, and reading problems) were most associated with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); to determine whether these comorbid problems shared executive and motor problems on an endophenotype level with ADHD; and to determine whether executive functioning (EF)-and motor-endophenotypes supported the hypothesis that ADHD with comorbid problems is a qualitatively different phenotype than ADHD without comorbid problems. An EF-and a motor-endophenotype were formed based on nine neuropsychological tasks administered to 816 children from ADHD-and control-families. Additional data on comorbid problems were gathered using questionnaires. Results indicated that oppositional defiant behaviors appeared the most important comorbid problems of ADHD, followed by autistic traits, and than followed by motor coordination problems, anxiety, and reading problems. Both the EF-and motor-endophenotype were correlated and cross-correlated in siblings to autistic traits, motor coordination problems and reading problems, suggesting ADHD and these comorbid problems may possibly share familial/genetic EF and motor deficits. No such results were found for oppositional defiant behaviors and anxiety. ADHD in co-occurrence with comorbid problems may not be best seen as a distinct subtype of ADHD, but further research is warranted.
0 The vasa regulatory region mediates germline expression and maternal transmission of proteins in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae: a versatile tool for genetic control strategies. Germline specific promoters are an essential component of potential vector control strategies which function by genetic drive, however suitable promoters are not currently available for the main human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. We have identified the Anopheles gambiae vasa-like gene and found its expression to be specifically localized to both the male and female gonads in adult mosquitoes. We have functionally characterised using transgenic reporter lines the regulatory regions required for driving transgene expression in a pattern mirroring that of the endogenous vasa locus. Two reporter constructs indicate the existence of distinct vasa regulatory elements within the 5' untranslated regions responsible not only for the spatial and temporal but also for the sex specific germline expression. vasa driven eGFP expression in the ovary of heterozygous mosquitoes resulted in the progressive accumulation of maternal protein and transcript in developing oocytes that were then detectable in all embryos and neonatal larvae. We have characterized the vasa regulatory regions that are not only suited to drive transgenes in the early germline of both sexes but could also be utilized to manipulate the zygotic genome of developing embryos via maternal deposition of active molecules. We have used computational models to show that a homing endonuclease-based gene drive system can function in the presence of maternal deposition and describe a novel non-invasive control strategy based on early vasa driven homing endonuclease expression.
1 The utility of MRI in predicting radiographic erosions in the metatarsophalangeal joints of the rheumatoid foot: a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal rheumatoid arthritis (RA) changes in the feet when hands are normal. The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of a metatarsophalangeal (MTP) erosion on MRI to predict a subsequent radiographic erosion in the same joint. Similar analyses were performed for bone marrow edema, predicting a subsequent MRI erosion. Descriptive results of other lesions are reported. Fifty patients with RA of less than 5 years' duration who were rheumatoid factor-positive and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide-positive were recruited. Patients on anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy were excluded. Anti-TNF therapy could begin after enrollment. MRI and radiographs of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th MTP joints bilaterally were taken at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months. Clinical data were collected. Fifty patients were recruited; 46 patients had suitable data. Results for MRI erosions predicting subsequent radiographic erosions for 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, were as follows: sensitivity 0.75, 0.60, 0.75; specificity 0.93, 0.94, 0.94; PPV 0.086, 0.10, 0.17; NPV 0.998, 0.995, 0.995. Results for MRI bone marrow edema predicting MRI erosions at 6 and 12 months, respectively, revealed sensitivity 0.50, 0.67; specificity 0.97, 0.97; PPV 0.25, 0.50; NPV 0.99, 0.99. Synovitis was the most common finding and, when present in isolation, resolved on 67.3% of subsequent studies. MRI erosions persisted on subsequent studies with one exception. Forty-six percent of the cohort was on anti-TNF therapy after study inception. The PPV of MRI erosions to predict subsequent radiographic erosions was low. Similarly, the PPV of bone marrow edema to predict a later MRI erosion was low. Alternatively, the NPV of the absence of an MRI erosion or bone marrow edema predicts that a later radiographic erosion or MRI erosion will likely not develop. Anti-TNF therapies may have resulted in the lower-than-anticipated PPVs. MRI descriptions of bone edema may represent a more critical time to treat in order to avoid damage, whereas an MRI erosion represents more permanent damage. This study suggests that imaging modalities more sensitive than radiographs are necessary to monitor disease in the biologic era.
0 Heritable and lineage-specific gene knockdown in zebrafish embryo. Reduced expression of developmentally important genes and tumor suppressors due to haploinsufficiency or epigenetic suppression has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of various malignancies. However, methodology that allows spatio-temporally knockdown of gene expression in various model organisms such as zebrafish has not been well established, which largely limits the potential of zebrafish as a vertebrate model of human malignant disorders. Here, we report that multiple copies of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) are expressed from a single transcript that mimics the natural microRNA-30e precursor (mir-shRNA). The mir-shRNA, when microinjected into zebrafish embryos, induced an efficient knockdown of two developmentally essential genes chordin and alpha-catenin in a dose-controllable fashion. Furthermore, we designed a novel cassette vector to simultaneously express an intronic mir-shRNA and a chimeric red fluorescent protein driven by lineage-specific promoter, which efficiently reduced the expression of a chromosomally integrated reporter gene and an endogenously expressed gata-1 gene in the developing erythroid progenitors and hemangioblasts, respectively. This methodology provides an invaluable tool to knockdown developmental important genes in a tissue-specific manner or to establish animal models, in which the gene dosage is critically important in the pathogenesis of human disorders. The strategy should be also applicable to other model organisms.
1 UROX 2.0: an interactive tool for fitting atomic models into electron-microscopy reconstructions. Electron microscopy of a macromolecular structure can lead to three-dimensional reconstructions with resolutions that are typically in the 30-10 A range and sometimes even beyond 10 A. Fitting atomic models of the individual components of the macromolecular structure (e.g. those obtained by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance) into an electron-microscopy map allows the interpretation of the latter at near-atomic resolution, providing insight into the interactions between the components. Graphical software is presented that was designed for the interactive fitting and refinement of atomic models into electron-microscopy reconstructions. Several characteristics enable it to be applied over a wide range of cases and resolutions. Firstly, calculations are performed in reciprocal space, which results in fast algorithms. This allows the entire reconstruction (or at least a sizeable portion of it) to be used by taking into account the symmetry of the reconstruction both in the calculations and in the graphical display. Secondly, atomic models can be placed graphically in the map while the correlation between the model-based electron density and the electron-microscopy reconstruction is computed and displayed in real time. The positions and orientations of the models are refined by a least-squares minimization. Thirdly, normal-mode calculations can be used to simulate conformational changes between the atomic model of an individual component and its corresponding density within a macromolecular complex determined by electron microscopy. These features are illustrated using three practical cases with different symmetries and resolutions. The software, together with examples and user instructions, is available free of charge at http://mem.ibs.fr/UROX/.
3 Local suppression of T cell responses by arginase-induced L-arginine depletion in nonhealing leishmaniasis. The balance between T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cell responses is a major determinant of the outcome of experimental leishmaniasis, but polarized Th1 or Th2 responses are not sufficient to account for healing or nonhealing. Here we show that high arginase activity, a hallmark of nonhealing disease, is primarily expressed locally at the site of pathology. The high arginase activity causes local depletion of L-arginine, which impairs the capacity of T cells in the lesion to proliferate and to produce interferon-gamma, while T cells in the local draining lymph nodes respond normally. Healing, induced by chemotherapy, resulted in control of arginase activity and reversal of local immunosuppression. Moreover, competitive inhibition of arginase as well as supplementation with L-arginine restored T cell effector functions and reduced pathology and parasite growth at the site of lesions. These results demonstrate that in nonhealing leishmaniasis, arginase-induced L-arginine depletion results in impaired T cell responses. Our results identify a novel mechanism in leishmaniasis that contributes to the failure to heal persistent lesions and suggest new approaches to therapy.
0 Science review: Cell membrane expression (connectivity) regulates neutrophil delivery, function and clearance. As the principal cellular component of the inflammatory host defense and contributor to host injury after severe physiologic insult, the neutrophil is inherently coupled to patient outcome in both health and disease. Extensive research has focused on the mechanisms that regulate neutrophil delivery, function, and clearance from the inflammatory microenvironment. The neutrophil cell membrane mediates the interaction of the neutrophil with the extracellular environment; it expresses a complex array of adhesion molecules and receptors for various ligands, including mediators, cytokines, immunoglobulins, and membrane molecules on other cells. This article presents a review and analysis of the evidence that the neutrophil membrane plays a central role in regulating neutrophil delivery (production, rolling, adhesion, diapedesis, and chemotaxis), function (priming and activation, microbicidal activity, and neutrophil-mediated host injury), and clearance (apoptosis and necrosis). In addition, we review how change in neutrophil membrane expression is synonymous with change in neutrophil function in vivo. Employing a complementary analysis of the neutrophil as a complex system, neutrophil membrane expression may be regarded as a measure of neutrophil connectivity, with altered patterns of connectivity representing functionally distinct neutrophil states. Thus, not only does the neutrophil membrane mediate the processes that characterize the neutrophil lifecycle, but characterization of neutrophil membrane expression represents a technology with which to evaluate neutrophil function.
1 A-MADMAN: annotation-based microarray data meta-analysis tool. Publicly available datasets of microarray gene expression signals represent an unprecedented opportunity for extracting genomic relevant information and validating biological hypotheses. However, the exploitation of this exceptionally rich mine of information is still hampered by the lack of appropriate computational tools, able to overcome the critical issues raised by meta-analysis. This work presents A-MADMAN, an open source web application which allows the retrieval, annotation, organization and meta-analysis of gene expression datasets obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. A-MADMAN addresses and resolves several open issues in the meta-analysis of gene expression data. A-MADMAN allows i) the batch retrieval from Gene Expression Omnibus and the local organization of raw data files and of any related meta-information, ii) the re-annotation of samples to fix incomplete, or otherwise inadequate, metadata and to create user-defined batches of data, iii) the integrative analysis of data obtained from different Affymetrix platforms through custom chip definition files and meta-normalization. Software and documentation are available on-line at http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/bioinfo/amadman/.
0 Validation of housekeeping genes for quantitative real-time PCR in in-vivo and in-vitro models of cerebral ischaemia. Studies of gene expression in experimental cerebral ischaemia models can contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of brain ischaemia and to identifying prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets. The normalization of relative qRT-PCR data using a suitable reference gene is a crucial prerequisite for obtaining reliable conclusions. No validated housekeeping genes have been reported for the relative quantification of the mRNA expression profile activated in in-vitro ischaemic conditions, whereas for the in-vivo model different reference genes have been used. The present study aims to determine the expression stability of ten housekeeping genes (Gapdh, beta2m, Hprt, Ppia, Rpl13a, Oaz1, 18S rRNA, Gusb, Ywhaz and Sdha) to establish their suitability as control genes for in-vitro and in-vivo cerebral ischaemia models. The expression stability of the candidate reference genes was evaluated using the 2-Delta C'T method and ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. For the in-vitro model using primary cultures of rat astrocytes, all genes analysed except for Rpl13a and Sdha were found to have significantly different levels of mRNA expression. These different levels were also found in the case of the in-vivo model of pMCAO in rats except for Hprt, Sdha and Ywhaz mRNA, where the expression did not vary. Sdha and Ywhaz were identified by geNorm and NormFinder as the two most stable genes. We have validated endogenous control genes for qRT-PCR analysis of gene expression in in-vitro and in-vivo cerebral ischaemia models. For normalization purposes, Rpl13a and Sdha are found to be the most suitable genes for the in-vitro model and Sdha and Ywhaz for the in-vivo model. Genes previously used as housekeeping genes for the in-vivo model in the literature were not validated as good control genes in the present study, showing the need for careful evaluation for each new experimental setup.
0 Virological efficacy and emergence of drug resistance in adults on antiretroviral treatment in rural Tanzania. Virological response to antiretroviral treatment (ART) in rural Africa is poorly described. We examined virological efficacy and emergence of drug resistance in adults receiving first-line ART for up to 4 years in rural Tanzania. Haydom Lutheran Hospital has provided ART to HIV-infected patients since October 2003. A combination of stavudine or zidovudine with lamivudine and either nevirapine or efavirenz is the standard first-line regimen. Nested in a longitudinal cohort study of patients consecutively starting ART, we carried out a cross-sectional virological efficacy survey between November 2007 and June 2008. HIV viral load was measured in all adults who had completed at least 6 months first-line ART, and genotypic resistance was determined in patients with viral load >1000 copies/mL. Virological response was measured in 212 patients, of whom 158 (74.5%) were women, and median age was 35 years (interquartile range [IQR] 29-43). Median follow-up time was 22.3 months (IQR 14.0-29.9). Virological suppression, defined as <400 copies/mL, was observed in 187 patients (88.2%). Overall, prevalence of > or =1 clinically significant resistance mutation was 3.9, 8.4, 16.7 and 12.5% in patients receiving ART for 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively. Among those successfully genotyped, the most frequent mutations were M184I/V (64%), conferring resistance to lamivudine, and K103N (27%), Y181C (27%) and G190A (27%), conferring resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), whereas 23% had thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), associated with cross-resistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Dual-class resistance, i.e. resistance to both NRTIs and NNRTIs, was found in 64%. Virological suppression rates were good up to 4 years after initiating ART in a rural Tanzanian hospital. However, drug resistance increased with time, and dual-class resistance was common, raising concerns about exhaustion of future antiretroviral drug options. This study might provide a useful forecast of drug resistance and demand for second-line antiretroviral drugs in rural Africa in the coming years.
1 Development and assignment of bovine-specific PCR systems for the Texas nomenclature marker genes and isolation of homologous BAC probes. In 1996, Popescu et al. published the Texas standard nomenclature of the bovine karyotype in which 31 marker genes, already mapped in man, were chosen to permit unambiguous identification and numbering of each bovine chromosome. However, specific PCR systems were not available for each marker gene thus preventing the assignment of part of these markers by somatic cell hybrid analysis. In addition, some difficulties remained with the nomenclature of BTA25, BTA27 and BTA29. In this work, specific PCR systems were developed for each of the marker genes except VIL1 (see results), from either existing bovine or human sequences, and a bovine BAC library was screened to obtain the corresponding BAC clones. These PCR systems were used successfully to confirm the assignment of each marker gene (except for LDHA, see results) by analysis on the INRA hamster-bovine somatic cell hybrid panel. The difficulties observed for LDHA and VIL1 are probably due to the fact that these genes belong to large gene families and therefore suggest that they may not be the most appropriate markers for a standardisation effort. This panel of BACs is available to the scientific community and has served as a basis for the establishment of a revised standard nomenclature of bovine chromosomes.
1 Prediction and validation of a mechanism to control the threshold for inhibitory synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity, neuronal activity-dependent sustained alteration of the efficacy of synaptic transmission, underlies learning and memory. Activation of positive-feedback signaling pathways by an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) has been implicated in synaptic plasticity. However, the mechanism that determines the [Ca(2+)](i) threshold for inducing synaptic plasticity is elusive. Here, we developed a kinetic simulation model of inhibitory synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum, and systematically analyzed the behavior of intricate molecular networks composed of protein kinases, phosphatases, etc. The simulation showed that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which is essential for the induction of synaptic plasticity, was persistently activated or suppressed in response to different combinations of stimuli. The sustained CaMKII activation depended on synergistic actions of two positive-feedback reactions, CaMKII autophosphorylation and CaMKII-mediated inhibition of a CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase, PDE1. The simulation predicted that PDE1-mediated feedforward inhibition of CaMKII predominantly controls the Ca(2+) threshold, which was confirmed by electrophysiological experiments in primary cerebellar cultures. Thus, combined application of simulation and experiments revealed that the Ca(2+) threshold for the cerebellar inhibitory synaptic plasticity is primarily determined by PDE1.
3 Admixture in Hispanic Americans: its impact on ITGAM association and implications for admixture mapping in SLE. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) disproportionately affects minorities, such as Hispanic Americans (HA). Prevalence of SLE is 3-5 times higher in HA than in European-derived populations and have more active disease at the time of diagnosis, with more serious organ system involvement. HA is an admixed population, it is possible that there is an effect of admixture on the relative risk of the disease. This admixture can create substantial increase of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in both magnitude and range, which can provide a unique opportunity for admixture mapping. The main objectives of this study are to (a) estimate hidden population structure in HA individuals; (b) estimate individual ancestry proportions and its impact on SLE risk; (c) assess impact of admixture on ITGAM association, a recently identified SLE susceptibility gene; and (d) estimate power of admixture mapping in HA. Our dataset contained 1125 individuals, of whom 884 (657 SLE cases and 227 controls) were self-classified as HA. Using 107 unlinked ancestry informative markers (AIMs), we estimated hidden population structure and individual ancestry in HA. Out of 5671 possible pairwise LD, 54% were statistically significant, indicating recent population admixture. The best-fitted model for HA was a four-population model with average ancestry of European (48%), American-Indian (AI) (40%), African (8%) and a fourth population (4%) with unknown ancestry. We also identified significant higher risk associated with AI ancestry (odds ratio (OR)=4.84, P=0.0001, 95% CI (confidence interval)=2.14-10.95) on overall SLE. We showed that ITGAM is associated as a risk factor for SLE (OR=2.06, P=8.74 x 10(-5), 95% CI=1.44-2.97). This association is not affected by population substructure or admixture. We have shown that HA have great potential and are an appropriate population for admixture mapping. As expected, the case-only design is more powerful than case-control design, for any given admixture proportion or ancestry risk ratio.
3 Elongation factor eEF1B modulates functions of the release factors eRF1 and eRF3 and the efficiency of translation termination in yeast. Termination of translation in eukaryotes is controlled by two interacting polypeptide chain release factors, eRF1 and eRF3. While eRF1 recognizes nonsense codons, eRF3 facilitates polypeptide chain release from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner. Besides termination, both release factors have essential, but poorly characterized functions outside of translation. To characterize further the functions of yeast eRF1 and eRF3, a genetic screen for their novel partner proteins was performed. As a result, the genes for gamma (TEF4 and TEF3/CAM1) and alpha (TEF5/EFB1) subunits of the translation elongation factor eEF1B, known to catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for GTP on eEF1A, were revealed. These genes act as dosage suppressors of a synthetic growth defect caused by some mutations in the SUP45 and SUP35 genes encoding eRF1 and eRF3, respectively. Extra copies of TEF5 and TEF3 can also suppress the temperature sensitivity of some sup45 and sup35 mutants and reduce nonsense codon readthrough caused by these omnipotent suppressors. Besides, overproduction of eEF1Balpha reduces nonsense codon readthrough in the strain carrying suppressor tRNA. Such effects were not shown for extra copies of TEF2, which encodes eEF1A, thus indicating that they were not due to eEF1A activation. The data obtained demonstrate involvement of the translation elongation factor eEF1B in modulating the functions of translation termination factors and suggest its possible role in GDP for GTP exchange on eRF3.
0 Accuracy of breeding values of 'unrelated' individuals predicted by dense SNP genotyping. Recent developments in SNP discovery and high throughput genotyping technology have made the use of high-density SNP markers to predict breeding values feasible. This involves estimation of the SNP effects in a training data set, and use of these estimates to evaluate the breeding values of other 'evaluation' individuals. Simulation studies have shown that these predictions of breeding values can be accurate, when training and evaluation individuals are (closely) related. However, many general applications of genomic selection require the prediction of breeding values of 'unrelated' individuals, i.e. individuals from the same population, but not particularly closely related to the training individuals. Accuracy of selection was investigated by computer simulation of small populations. Using scaling arguments, the results were extended to different populations, training data sets and genome sizes, and different trait heritabilities. Prediction of breeding values of unrelated individuals required a substantially higher marker density and number of training records than when prediction individuals were offspring of training individuals. However, when the number of records was 2*Ne*L and the number of markers was 10*Ne*L, the breeding values of unrelated individuals could be predicted with accuracies of 0.88 - 0.93, where Ne is the effective population size and L the genome size in Morgan. Reducing this requirement to 1*Ne*L individuals, reduced prediction accuracies to 0.73-0.83. For livestock populations, 1NeL requires about approximately 30,000 training records, but this may be reduced if training and evaluation animals are related. A prediction equation is presented, that predicts accuracy when training and evaluation individuals are related. For humans, 1NeL requires approximately 350,000 individuals, which means that human disease risk prediction is possible only for diseases that are determined by a limited number of genes. Otherwise, genotyping and phenotypic recording need to become very common in the future.
2 Building disease-specific drug-protein connectivity maps from molecular interaction networks and PubMed abstracts. The recently proposed concept of molecular connectivity maps enables researchers to integrate experimental measurements of genes, proteins, metabolites, and drug compounds under similar biological conditions. The study of these maps provides opportunities for future toxicogenomics and drug discovery applications. We developed a computational framework to build disease-specific drug-protein connectivity maps. We integrated gene/protein and drug connectivity information based on protein interaction networks and literature mining, without requiring gene expression profile information derived from drug perturbation experiments on disease samples. We described the development and application of this computational framework using Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as a primary example in three steps. First, molecular interaction networks were incorporated to reduce bias and improve relevance of AD seed proteins. Second, PubMed abstracts were used to retrieve enriched drug terms that are indirectly associated with AD through molecular mechanistic studies. Third and lastly, a comprehensive AD connectivity map was created by relating enriched drugs and related proteins in literature. We showed that this molecular connectivity map development approach outperformed both curated drug target databases and conventional information retrieval systems. Our initial explorations of the AD connectivity map yielded a new hypothesis that diltiazem and quinidine may be investigated as candidate drugs for AD treatment. Molecular connectivity maps derived computationally can help study molecular signature differences between different classes of drugs in specific disease contexts. To achieve overall good data coverage and quality, a series of statistical methods have been developed to overcome high levels of data noise in biological networks and literature mining results. Further development of computational molecular connectivity maps to cover major disease areas will likely set up a new model for drug development, in which therapeutic/toxicological profiles of candidate drugs can be checked computationally before costly clinical trials begin.
2 Unstable angina early after aortic valve replacement surgery in a female patient with normal coronary arteries preoperatively--a case report. Angina pectoris early after aortic valve replacement surgery in patients with previously normal coronary arteries may be life threatening and has to be assessed immediately. 12 weeks after aortic valve replacement surgery, a 60-year-old female patient was referred for evaluation of recent onset of severe chest pain on mild exertion and at rest. Coronary angiography showed severe stenosis involving the left coronary ostium and the left main stem. The patient was urgently referred for bypass surgery and had an uneventful postoperative recovery. A high degree of suspicion is needed for early recognition and aggressive management of this rare but serious complication.
0 Polymorphisms in NF-kappaB inhibitors and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) family is a set of transcription factors with key roles in the induction of the inflammatory response and may be the link between inflammation and cancer development. This pathway has been shown to influence ovarian epithelial tissue repair. Inhibitors of kappaB (IkappaB) prevent NF-kappaB activation by sequestering NF-kappaB proteins in the cytoplasm until IkappaB proteins are phosphorylated and degraded. We used a case-control study to evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NFKBIA and NFKBIB (the genes encoding IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta, respectively) and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. We queried 19 tagSNPs and putative-functional SNPs among 930 epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 1,037 controls from two studies. The minor allele for one synonymous SNP in NFKBIA, rs1957106, was associated with decreased risk (p = 0.03). Considering the number of single-SNP tests performed and null gene-level results, we conclude that NFKBIA and NFKBIB are not likely to harbor ovarian cancer risk alleles. Due to its biological significance in ovarian cancer, additional genes encoding NF-kappaB subunits, activating and inhibiting molecules, and signaling molecules warrant interrogation.
0 Immune reactions against elongation factor 2 kinase: specific pathogenesis of gastric ulcer from Helicobacter pylori infection. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a definite causative factor for gastric ulcers (GUs). In the present study we detected a specific antigen of gastric epithelial cells (HGC-27) using cell ELISA, which was recognized by the sera of GU patients (n = 20) but not in patients with chronic gastritis (CG; n = 20) or in healthy volunteers (HC; n = 10). This antigen was over-expressed by a stressful (heat-stressed) environment, and was identified as elongation factor 2 kinase (EF-2K) by western blotting. The GU patients' lymphocytes stimulated by H. pylori specifically disrupted heat-stressed HGC-27 cells in a cytotoxic assay. In flow cytometry, the effector cells (lymphocytes) from GU patients were significantly differentiated to T helper type 1 lymphocyte (Th1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) as opposed to those from CG patients. The target cells (HGC-27) expressed EF-2K and MHC-class I together with costimulatory molecules from heat stress. This antigen specific immune mechanism could have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of GU.
0 A molecular phylogeny of the genus Alloteropsis (Panicoideae, Poaceae) suggests an evolutionary reversion from C4 to C3 photosynthesis. The grass Alloteropsis semialata is the only plant species with both C(3) and C(4) subspecies. It therefore offers excellent potential as a model system for investigating the genetics, physiology and ecological significance of the C(4) photosynthetic pathway. Here, a molecular phylogeny of the genus Alloteropsis is constructed to: (a) confirm the close relationship between the C(3) and C(4) subspecies of A. semialata; and (b) infer evolutionary relationships between species within the Alloteropsis genus. The chloroplast gene ndhF was sequenced from 12 individuals, representing both subspecies of A. semialata and all four of the other species in the genus. ndhF sequences were added to those previously sequenced from the Panicoideae, and used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The phylogeny confirms that the two subspecies of A. semialata are among the most recently diverging lineages of C(3) and C(4) taxa currently recognized within the Panicoideae. Furthermore, the position of the C(3) subspecies of A. semialata within the Alloteropsis genus is consistent with the hypothesis that its physiology represents a reversion from C(4) photosynthesis. The data point to a similar evolutionary event in the Panicum stenodes-P. caricoides-P. mertensii clade. The Alloteropsis genus is monophyletic and occurs in a clade with remarkable diversity of photosynthetic biochemistry and leaf anatomy. These results confirm the utility of A. semialata as a model system for investigating C(3) and C(4) physiology, and provide molecular data that are consistent with reversions from C(4) to C(3) photosynthesis in two separate clades. It is suggested that further phylogenetic and functional investigations of the Alloteropsis genus and closely related taxa are likely to shed new light on the mechanisms and intermediate stages underlying photosynthetic pathway evolution.
1 Molecular cloning and characterization of the germline-restricted chromosome sequence in the zebra finch. The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) germline-restricted chromosome (GRC) is the largest chromosome and has a unique system of transmission in germ cells. In the male, the GRC exists as a single heterochromatic chromosome in the germline and is eliminated from nuclei in late spermatogenesis. In the female, the GRC is bivalent and euchromatic and experiences recombination. These characteristics suggest a female-specific or female-beneficial function of the GRC. To shed light on the function of GRC, we cloned a portion of the GRC using random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction and analyzed it using molecular genetic and cytogenetic methods. The GRC clone hybridized strongly to testis but not blood DNA in genomic Southern blots. In fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis on meiotic chromosomes from synaptonemal complex spreads, the probe showed hybridization across a large area of the GRC, suggesting that it contains repetitive sequences. We isolated a sequence homologous to the GRC from zebra finch chromosome 3 and a region of chicken chromosome 1 that is homologous to zebra finch chromosome 3; the phylogenetic analysis of these three sequences suggested that the GRC sequence and the zebra finch chromosome 3 sequence are most closely related. Thus, the GRC sequences likely originated from autosomal DNA and have evolved after the galliform-passeriform split. The present study provides a foundation for further study of the intriguing GRC.
3 The 2005 census and mapping of slums in Bangladesh: design, select results and application. The concentration of poverty and adverse environmental circumstances within slums, particularly those in the cities of developing countries, are an increasingly important concern for both public health policy initiatives and related programs in other sectors. However, there is a dearth of information on the population-level implications of slum life for human health. This manuscript describes the 2005 Census and Mapping of Slums (CMS), which used geographic information systems (GIS) tools and digital satellite imagery combined with more traditional fieldwork methodologies, to obtain detailed, up-to-date and new information about slum life in all slums of six major cities in Bangladesh (including Dhaka). The CMS found that Bangladeshi slums are very diverse: there are wide intra- and inter-city variations in population size, density, the percent of urban populations living in slums, and sanitation conditions. Findings also show that common beliefs about slums may be outdated; of note, tenure insecurity was found to be an issue in only a small minority of slums. The methodology used in the 2005 Bangladesh CMS provides a useful approach to mapping slums that could be applied to urban areas in other low income societies. This methodology may become an increasingly important analytic tool to inform policy, as cities in developing countries are forecasted to continue increasing their share of total global population in the coming years, with slum populations more than doubling in size during the same period.
1 Identification of circulating tumour cells in early stage breast cancer patients using multi marker immunobead RT-PCR. The ability to screen blood of early stage operable breast cancer patients for circulating tumour cells is of potential importance for identifying patients at risk of developing distant relapse. We present the results of a study of the efficacy of the immunobead RT-PCR method in identifying patients with circulating tumour cells. Immunomagnetic enrichment of circulating tumour cells followed by RT-PCR (immunobead RT-PCR) with a panel of five epithelial specific markers (ELF3, EPHB4, EGFR, MGB1 and TACSTD1) was used to screen for circulating tumour cells in the peripheral blood of 56 breast cancer patients. Twenty patients were positive for two or more RT-PCR markers, including seven patients who were node negative by conventional techniques. Significant increases in the frequency of marker positivity was seen in lymph node positive patients, in patients with high grade tumours and in patients with lymphovascular invasion. A strong trend towards improved disease free survival was seen for marker negative patients although it did not reach significance (p = 0.08). Multi-marker immunobead RT-PCR analysis of peripheral blood is a robust assay that is capable of detecting circulating tumour cells in early stage breast cancer patients.
3 Cross-language differential item functioning of the job content questionnaire among European countries: the JACE study. Little is known about cross-language measurement equivalence of the job content questionnaire (JCQ) PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to assess the extent of cross-language differential item functioning (DIF) of the 27 JCQ items in six languages (French, Dutch, Belgian-French, Belgian-Dutch (Flemish), Italian, and Swedish) from six European research centers and to test whether its effects on the scale-level mean comparisons among the centers were substantial or not. A partial gamma coefficient method was used for statistical DIF analyses where the Flemish JCQ was the reference for other language versions. Additionally, equivalence between the Flemish and Dutch translations was subjected to a judgmental review. On average, 36% to 39% of the total tested items appeared to be cross-language DIF items in the statistical analyses. The judgmental review indicated that half of the DIF items may be associated with translation difference. The impacts of the DIF items on the mean comparisons of the JCQ scales between the centers were non-trivial: underestimated skill discretion (Milan), underestimated decision authority (Leiden), underestimated psychological demands (Milan women), and incomparable coworker support (Gothenburg 95). Cross-language DIF of the JCQ among European countries should be considered in international comparative studies on psychosocial job hazards using JCQ scales.
2 Changes in basal insulin infusion rates with subcutaneous insulin infusion: time until a change in metabolic effect is induced in patients with type 1 diabetes. OBJECTIVE Evaluation of the time required until a change in the basal insulin infusion rate with an insulin pump induces subsequent changes in the metabolic effect. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this euglycemic glucose clamp study, 10 male subjects with type 1 diabetes received three different subcutaneous insulin infusion rates (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 units/h; for 4 h each) of insulin lispro (IL) with insulin pumps. RESULTS An increase in insulinemia occurred within 15-30 min after changing the infusion rate. While the serum IL levels reached a steady state at the end of the infusion period, the glucose infusion rates did not always reach steady-state levels with the higher infusion rates. However, an increase in the glucose consumption occurred within 30-60 min after switching the infusion rate. CONCLUSIONS Several hours are required until a new steady state in the metabolic effect is achieved after a significant change in basal insulin infusion.
0 Exoskeletons and orthoses: classification, design challenges and future directions. For over a century, technologists and scientists have actively sought the development of exoskeletons and orthoses designed to augment human economy, strength, and endurance. While there are still many challenges associated with exoskeletal and orthotic design that have yet to be perfected, the advances in the field have been truly impressive. In this commentary, I first classify exoskeletons and orthoses into devices that act in series and in parallel to a human limb, providing a few examples within each category. This classification is then followed by a discussion of major design challenges and future research directions critical to the field of exoskeletons and orthoses.
2 Increased levels of soluble CD226 in sera accompanied by decreased membrane CD226 expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from cancer patients. As a cellular membrane triggering receptor, CD226 is involved in the NK cell- or CTL-mediated lysis of tumor cells of different origin, including freshly isolated tumor cells and tumor cell lines. Here, we evaluated soluble CD226 (sCD226) levels in sera, and membrane CD226 (mCD226) expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from cancer patients as well as normal subjects, and demonstrated the possible function and origin of the altered sCD226, which may provide useful information for understanding the mechanisms of tumor escape and for immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy. Soluble CD226 levels in serum samples from cancer patients were significantly higher than those in healthy individuals (P < 0.001), while cancer patients exhibited lower PBMC mCD226 expression than healthy individuals (P < 0.001). CD226-Fc fusion protein could significantly inhibit the cytotoxicity of NK cells against K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, three kinds of protease inhibitors could notably increase mCD226 expression on PMA-stimulated PBMCs and Jurkat cells with a decrease in the sCD226 level in the cell culture supernatant. These findings suggest that sCD226 might be shed from cell membranes by certain proteases, and, further, sCD226 may be used as a predictor for monitoring cancer, and more important, a possible immunotherapy target, which may be useful in clinical application.
1 Sex differences in global mRNA content of human skeletal muscle. Women oxidize more fat as compared to men during endurance exercise and several groups have shown that the mRNA content of selected genes related to fat oxidation are higher in women (e.g. hormone sensitive lipase, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, CD36). One of the possible mechanisms is that women tend to have a higher area percentage of type I skeletal muscle fibers as compared with men. Consequently, we hypothesized that sex would influence the basal mRNA and protein content for genes involved in metabolism and the determination of muscle fiber type. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were collected from healthy men and women. We examined mRNA content globally using Affymetrix GeneChips, and selected genes were examined and/or confirmed by RT-PCR. Furthermore, we examined protein content by Western blot analysis. Stringent gene array analysis revealed 66 differentially expressed genes representing metabolism, mitochondrial function, transport, protein biosynthesis, cell proliferation, signal transduction pathways, transcription and translation. Stringent gene array analysis and RT-PCR confirmed that mRNA for; acyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2), trifunctional protein beta (HADHB), catalase, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) were higher in women. Targeted gene analysis revealed that myosin heavy chain I (MHCI), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)delta were higher in women compared with men. Surprisingly, there were no significant sex based differences in protein content for HADHB, ACAA2, catalase, PPARdelta, and MHC1. In conclusion, the differences in the basal mRNA content in resting skeletal muscle suggest that men and women are transcriptionally "primed" for known physiological differences in metabolism however the mechanism behind sex differences in fiber type remains to be determined.
1 RNase 7 contributes to the cutaneous defense against Enterococcus faecium. Human skin is able to mount a fast response against invading microorganisms by the release of antimicrobial proteins such as the ribonuclease RNase 7. Because RNase 7 exhibits high activity against Enterococcus faecium the aim of this study was to further explore the role of RNase 7 in the cutaneous innate defense system against E. faecium. Absolute quantification using real-time PCR and ELISA revealed that primary keratinocytes expressed high levels of RNase 7. Immunohistochemistry showed RNase 7 expression in all epidermal layers of the skin with an intensification in the upper more differentiated layers. Furthermore, RNase 7 was secreted by keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo in a site-dependent way. RNase 7 was still active against E. faecium at low pH (5.5) or high NaCl (150 mM) concentration and the bactericidal activity of RNase 7 against E. faecium required no ribonuclease activity as shown by recombinant RNase 7 lacking enzymatic activity. To further explore the role of RNase 7 in cutaneous defense against E. faecium, we investigated whether RNase 7 contributes to the E. faecium killing activity of skin extracts derived from stratum corneum. Treatment of the skin extract with an RNase 7 specific antibody, which neutralizes the antimicrobial activity of RNase 7, diminished its E. faecium killing activity. Our data indicate that RNase 7 contributes to the E. faecium-killing activity of skin extracts and suggest an important role for RNase 7 in the protection of human skin against E. faecium colonization.
3 The anticancer activity of lytic peptides is inhibited by heparan sulfate on the surface of the tumor cells. Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) with antitumor activity constitute a promising group of novel anticancer agents. These peptides induce lysis of cancer cells through interactions with the plasma membrane. It is not known which cancer cell membrane components influence their susceptibility to CAPs. We have previously shown that CAPs interact with the two glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), which are present on the surface of most cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the two GAGs in the cytotoxic activity of CAPs. Various cell lines, expressing different levels of cell surface GAGs, were exposed to bovine lactoferricin (LfcinB) and the designer peptide, KW5. The cytotoxic effect of the peptides was investigated by use of the colorimetric MTT viability assay. The cytotoxic effect on wild type CHO cells, expressing normal amounts of GAGs on the cell surface, and the mutant pgsA-745, that has no expression of GAGs on the cell surface, was also investigated. We show that cells not expressing HS were more susceptible to CAPs than cells expressing HS at the cell surface. Further, exogenously added heparin inhibited the cytotoxic effect of the peptides. Chondroitin sulfate had no effect on the cytotoxic activity of KW5 and only minor effects on LfcinB cytotoxicity. Our results show for the first time that negatively charged molecules at the surface of cancer cells inhibit the cytotoxic activity of CAPs. Our results indicate that HS at the surface of cancer cells sequesters CAPs away from the phospholipid bilayer and thereby impede their ability to induce cytolysis.
3 New antibiotic molecules: bypassing the membrane barrier of gram negative bacteria increases the activity of peptide deformylase inhibitors. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria have become a major concern in hospitals worldwide and urgently require the development of new antibacterial molecules. Peptide deformylase is an intracellular target now well-recognized for the design of new antibiotics. The bacterial susceptibility to such a cytoplasmic target primarily depends on the capacity of the compound to reach and accumulate in the cytosol. To determine the respective involvement of penetration (influx) and pumping out (efflux) mechanisms to peptide deformylase inhibitors (PDF-I) activity, the potency of various series was determined using various genetic contexts (efflux overproducers or efflux-deleted strains) and membrane permeabilizers. Depending on the structure of the tested molecules, two behaviors could be observed: (i) for actinonin the first PDF-I characterized, the AcrAB efflux system was the main parameter involved in the bacterial susceptibility, and (ii), for the latest PDF-Is such as the derivatives of 2-(5-bromo-1H-indol-3-yl)-N-hydroxyacetamide, the penetration through the membrane was a important limiting step. Our results clearly show that the bacterial membrane plays a key role in modulating the antibacterial activity of PDF-Is. The bacterial susceptibility for these new antibacterial molecules can be improved by two unrelated ways in MDR strains: by collapsing the Acr efflux activity or by increasing the uptake rate through the bacterial membrane. The efficiency of the second method is associated with the nature of the compound.
3 SENT: semantic features in text. We present SENT (semantic features in text), a functional interpretation tool based on literature analysis. SENT uses Non-negative Matrix Factorization to identify topics in the scientific articles related to a collection of genes or their products, and use them to group and summarize these genes. In addition, the application allows users to rank and explore the articles that best relate to the topics found, helping put the analysis results into context. This approach is useful as an exploratory step in the workflow of interpreting and understanding experimental data, shedding some light into the complex underlying biological mechanisms. This tool provides a user-friendly interface via a web site, and a programmatic access via a SOAP web server. SENT is freely accessible at http://sent.dacya.ucm.es.
3 Autophagy facilitates the development of breast cancer resistance to the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Autophagy has been emerging as a novel cytoprotective mechanism to increase tumor cell survival under conditions of metabolic stress and hypoxia as well as to escape chemotherapy-induced cell death. To elucidate whether autophagy might also protect cancer cells from the growth inhibitory effects of targeted therapies, we evaluated the autophagic status of preclinical breast cancer models exhibiting auto-acquired resistance to the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Tzb). We first examined the basal autophagic levels in Tzb-naive SKBR3 cells and in two pools of Tzb-conditioned SKBR3 cells (TzbR), which optimally grow in the presence of Tzb doses as high as 200 microg/ml Tzb. Fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that the number of punctate LC3 structures -a hallmark of autophagy- was drastically higher in Tzb-refractory cells than in Tzb-sensitive SKBR3 parental cells. Immunoblotting analyses confirmed that the lipidation product of the autophagic conversion of LC3 was accumulated to high levels in TzbR cells. High levels of the LC3 lipidated form in Tzb-refractory cells were accompanied by decreased p62/sequestosome-1 protein expression, a phenomenon characterizing the occurrence of increased autophagic flux. Moreover, increased autophagy was actively used to survive Tzb therapy as TzbR pools were exquisitely sensitive to chemical inhibitors of autophagosomal formation/function. Knockdown of LC3 expression via siRNA similarly resulted in reduced TzbR cell proliferation and supra-additively interacted with Tzb to re-sensitize TzbR cells. Sub-groups of Tzb-naive SKBR3 parental cells accumulated LC3 punctate structures and decreased p62 expression after treatment with high-dose Tzb, likely promoting their own resistance. This is the first report showing that HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells chronically exposed to Tzb exhibit a bona fide up-regulation of the autophagic activity that efficiently works to protect breast cancer cells from the growth-inhibitory effects of Tzb. Therapeutic targeting autophagosome formation/function might represent a novel molecular avenue to reduce the emergence of Tzb resistance in HER2-dependent breast carcinomas.
0 Clustering of InsP3 receptors by InsP3 retunes their regulation by InsP3 and Ca2+. The versatility of Ca2+ signals derives from their spatio-temporal organization. For Ca2+ signals initiated by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), this requires local interactions between InsP3 receptors (InsP3Rs) mediated by their rapid stimulation and slower inhibition\ by cytosolic Ca2+. This allows hierarchical recruitment of Ca2+ release events as the InsP3 concentration increases. Single InsP3Rs respond first, then clustered InsP3Rs open together giving a local 'Ca2+ puff', and as puffs become more frequent they ignite regenerative Ca2+ waves. Using nuclear patch-clamp recording, here we demonstrate that InsP3Rs are initially randomly distributed with an estimated separation of 1 m. Low concentrations of InsP3 cause InsP3Rs to aggregate rapidly and reversibly into small clusters of about four closely associated InsP3Rs. At resting cytosolic [Ca2+], clustered InsP3Rs open independently, but with lower open probability, shorter open time, and less InsP3 sensitivity than lone InsP3Rs. Increasing cytosolic [Ca2+] reverses the inhibition caused by clustering, InsP3R gating becomes coupled, and the duration of multiple openings is prolonged. Clustering both exposes InsP3Rs to local Ca2+ rises and increases the effects of Ca2+. Dynamic regulation of clustering by InsP3 retunes InsP3R sensitivity to InsP3 and Ca2+, facilitating hierarchical recruitment of the elementary events that underlie all InsP3-evoked Ca2+ signals.
3 Functional analysis of -351 interleukin-9 promoter polymorphism reveals an activator controlled by NF-kappaB. Genetic studies have shown linkages for asthma to the chromosomal region 5q31-q33 in humans that includes the IL-9 gene. An A-to-G base substitution has been identified at bp -351 in the IL-9 promoter. The role of this polymorphism in IL-9 promoter function was assessed utilizing CD4+ T cells purified from individuals with one or two of the G alleles in comparison to those homozygous for the wild-type A. The presence of an A at -351 (A allele) increased mitogen-stimulated IL-9 transcription twofold in comparison to subjects with one or two G alleles at this position. Binding of nuclear extract proteins from IL-9-producing human cell lines to DNA sequences including this base exchange demonstrated specific binding of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Binding of NF-kappaB to the IL-9 promoter was confirmed in vivo using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Recombinant NF-kappaB bound to a promoter fragment with the A allele with fivefold higher affinity than it did to a promoter with the G allele. Individuals carrying the A allele of the IL-9 promoter display increased synthesis of IL-9, which may result in strong Th2 immune responses and a modulation of their susceptibility to infectious, neoplastic, parasitic or atopic disease.
1 Intracranial and spinal ependymomas: review of MR images in 61 patients. To compare the age distribution and characteristic MR imaging findings of ependymoma for each typical location within the neuraxis. During a recent eleven-year period, MR images of 61 patients with histologically proven ependymomas were obtained and retrospectively reviewed in terms of incidence, peak age, location, size, signal intensity, the presence or absence of cyst and hemorrhage, enhancement pattern, and other associated findings. Among the 61 patients, tumor location was spinal in 35 (57%), infrartentorial in 19 (31%), and supratentorial in seven (12%). In four of these seven, the tumor was located in brain parenchyma, and in most cases developed between the third and fifth decade. Approximately half of the infratentorial tumors occurred during the first decade. The signal intensity of ependymomas was nonspecific, regardless of their location. A cystic component was seen in 71% (5/7) of supratentorial, 74% (14/19) of infratentorial, and 14% (5/35) of spinal cord tumors. Forty- nine percent (17/35) of those in the spinal cord were associated with rostral and/or caudal reactive cysts. Intratumoral hemorrhage occurred in 57% (4/7) of supratentorial, 32% (6/19) of infratentorial, and 9% (3/35) of spinal cord tumors. In 17% (6/35) of spinal ependymomas, a curvilinear low T2 signal, suggesting marginal hemorrhage, was seen at the upper and/or lower margins of the tumors. Peritumoral edema occurred in 57% (4/7) of supratentorial, 6% (3/19) of infratentorial and 23% (8/35) of spinal cord tumors. Seventy-two percent (5/7) of supratentorial and 95% (18/19) of infratentorial tumors showed heterogeneous enhancement, while in 50% (17/34) of spinal cord tumors, enhancement was homogeneous. Even though the MR imaging findings of ependymomas vary and are nonspecific, awareness of these findings, and of tumor distribution according to age, is helpful and increases the likelihood of correct preoperative clinical diagnosis.
3 The TROVE module: a common element in Telomerase, Ro and Vault ribonucleoproteins. Ribonucleoproteins carry out a variety of important tasks in the cell. In this study we show that a number of these contain a novel module, that we speculate mediates RNA-binding. The TROVE module--Telomerase, Ro and Vault module--is found in TEP1 and Ro60 the protein components of three ribonucleoprotein particles. This novel module, consisting of one or more domains, may be involved in binding the RNA components of the three RNPs, which are telomerase RNA, Y RNA and vault RNA. A second conserved region in these proteins is shown to be a member of the vWA domain family. The vWA domain in TEP1 is closely related to the previously recognised vWA domain in VPARP a second component of the vault particle. This vWA domain may mediate interactions between these vault components or bind as yet unidentified components of the RNPs. This work suggests that a number of ribonucleoprotein components use a common RNA-binding module. The TROVE module is also found in bacterial ribonucleoproteins suggesting an ancient origin for these ribonucleoproteins.
3 Talin phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates Smurf1-mediated talin head ubiquitylation and cell migration. Cell migration is a dynamic process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly/disassembly. Talin, an actin and beta-integrin tail-binding protein, is essential for integrin activation and focal adhesion formation. Calpain-mediated cleavage of talin has a key role in focal adhesion turnover; however, the talin head domain, one of the two cleavage products, stimulates integrin activation, localizes to focal adhesions and maintains cell edge protrusions, suggesting that other steps, downstream of talin proteolysis, are required for focal adhesion disassembly. Here we show that talin head binds Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell polarity and migration, more tightly than full-length talin does and that this interaction leads to talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. We found that talin head is a substrate for Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is essential for cell migration, synaptic transmission and cancer metastasis. Cdk5 phosphorylated talin head at Ser 425, inhibiting its binding to Smurf1, thus preventing talin head ubiquitylation and degradation. Expression of the mutant tal(S425A), which resists Cdk5 phosphorylation thereby increasing its susceptibility to Smurf1-mediated ubiqitylation, resulted in extensive focal adhesion turnover and inhibited cell migration. Thus, talin head produced by calpain-induced cleavage of talin is degraded through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation; moreover, phosphorylation by Cdk5 regulates the binding of Smurf1 to talin head, controlling talin head turnover, adhesion stability and ultimately, cell migration.
1 Evaluation of RTS,S/AS02A and RTS,S/AS01B in adults in a high malaria transmission area. This study advances the clinical development of the RTS,S/AS01B candidate malaria vaccine to malaria endemic populations. As a primary objective it compares the safety and reactogenicity of RTS,S/AS01B to the more extensively evaluated RTS,S/AS02A vaccine. A Phase IIb, single centre, double-blind, controlled trial of 6 months duration with a subsequent 6 month single-blind follow-up conducted in Kisumu West District, Kenya between August 2005 and August 2006. 255 healthy adults aged 18 to 35 years were randomized (1ratio1ratio1) to receive 3 doses of RTS,S/AS02A, RTS,S/AS01B or rabies vaccine (Rabipur; Chiron Behring GmbH) at months 0, 1, 2. The primary objective was the occurrence of severe (grade 3) solicited or unsolicited general (i.e. systemic) adverse events (AEs) during 7 days follow up after each vaccination. Both candidate vaccines had a good safety profile and were well tolerated. One grade 3 systemic AE occurred within 7 days of vaccination (RTS,S/AS01B group). No unsolicited AEs or SAEs were related to vaccine. A marked increase in anti-CS antibody GMTs was observed post Dose 2 of both RTS,S/AS01B (31.6 EU/mL [95% CI: 23.9 to 41.6]) and RTS,S/AS02A (16.7 EU/mL [95% CI: 12.9 to 21.7]). A further increase was observed post Dose 3 in both the RTS,S/AS01B (41.4 EU/mL [95% CI: 31.7 to 54.2]) and RTS,S/AS02A (21.4 EU/mL [95% CI: 16.0 to 28.7]) groups. Anti-CS antibody GMTs were significantly greater with RTS,S/AS01B compared to RTS,S/AS02A at all time points post Dose 2 and Dose 3. Both candidate vaccines produced strong anti-HBs responses. Vaccine efficacy in the RTS,S/AS01B group was 29.5% (95% CI: -15.4 to 56.9, p = 0.164) and in the RTS,S/AS02A group 31.7% (95% CI: -11.6 to 58.2, p = 0.128). Both candidate malaria vaccines were well tolerated over a 12 month surveillance period. A more favorable immunogenicity profile was observed with RTS,S/AS01B than with RTS,S/AS02A.

1 ChemChains: a platform for simulation and analysis of biochemical networks aimed to laboratory scientists. New mathematical models of complex biological structures and computer simulation software allow modelers to simulate and analyze biochemical systems in silico and form mathematical predictions. Due to this potential predictive ability, the use of these models and software has the possibility to compliment laboratory investigations and help refine, or even develop, new hypotheses. However, the existing mathematical modeling techniques and simulation tools are often difficult to use by laboratory biologists without training in high-level mathematics, limiting their use to trained modelers. We have developed a Boolean network-based simulation and analysis software tool, ChemChains, which combines the advantages of the parameter-free nature of logical models while providing the ability for users to interact with their models in a continuous manner, similar to the way laboratory biologists interact with laboratory data. ChemChains allows users to simulate models in an automatic fashion under tens of thousands of different external environments, as well as perform various mutational studies. ChemChains combines the advantages of logical and continuous modeling and provides a way for laboratory biologists to perform in silico experiments on mathematical models easily, a necessary component of laboratory research in the systems biology era.
0 The Ets dominant repressor En/Erm enhances intestinal epithelial tumorigenesis in ApcMin mice. Ets transcription factors have been widely implicated in the control of tumorigenesis, with most studies suggesting tumor-promoting roles. However, few studies have examined Ets tumorigenesis-modifying functions in vivo using model genetic systems. Using mice expressing a previously characterized Ets dominant repressor transgene in the intestinal epithelium (Villin-En/Erm), we examined the consequences of blocking endogenous Ets-mediated transcriptional activation on tumorigenesis in the ApcMin model of intestinal carcinoma. En/Erm expression in the intestine, at levels not associated with overt crypt-villus dysmorphogenesis, results in a marked increase in tumor number in ApcMin animals. Moreover, when examined histologically, tumors from En/Erm-expressing animals show a trend toward greater stromal invasiveness. Detailed analysis of crypt-villus homeostasis in these En/Erm transgenic animals suggests increased epithelial turnover as one possible mechanism for the enhanced tumorigenesis. Our findings provide in vivo evidence for a tumor-restricting function of endogenous Ets factors in the intestinal epithelium.
0 The small molecule inhibitor QLT0267 Radiosensitizes squamous cell carcinoma cells of the head and neck. The constant increase of cancer cell resistance to radio- and chemotherapy hampers improvement of patient survival and requires novel targeting approaches. Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK) has been postulated as potent druggable cancer target. On the basis of our previous findings clearly showing that ILK transduces antisurvival signals in cells exposed to ionizing radiation, this study evaluated the impact of the small molecule inhibitor QLT0267, reported as putative ILK inhibitor, on the cellular radiation survival response of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells (hHNSCC). Parental FaDu cells and FaDu cells stably transfected with a constitutively active ILK mutant (FaDu-IH) or empty vectors, UTSCC45 cells, ILK(floxed/floxed(fl/fl)) and ILK(-/-) mouse fibroblasts were used. Cells grew either two-dimensionally (2D) on or three-dimensionally (3D) in laminin-rich extracellular matrix. Cells were treated with QLT0267 alone or in combination with irradiation (X-rays, 0-6 Gy single dose). ILK knockdown was achieved by small interfering RNA transfection. ILK kinase activity, clonogenic survival, number of residual DNA double strand breaks (rDSB; gammaH2AX/53BP1 foci assay), cell cycle distribution, protein expression and phosphorylation (e.g. Akt, p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)) were measured. Data on ILK kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt and p44/42 MAPK revealed a broad inhibitory spectrum of QLT0267 without specificity for ILK. QLT0267 significantly reduced basal cell survival and enhanced the radiosensitivity of FaDu and UTSCC45 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. QLT0267 exerted differential, cell culture model-dependent effects with regard to radiogenic rDSB and accumulation of cells in the G2 cell cycle phase. Relative to corresponding controls, FaDu-IH and ILK(fl/fl) fibroblasts showed enhanced radiosensitivity, which failed to be antagonized by QLT0267. A knockdown of ILK revealed no change in clonogenic survival of the tested cell lines as compared to controls. Our data clearly show that the small molecule inhibitor QLT0267 has potent cytotoxic and radiosensitizing capability in hHNSCC cells. However, QLT0267 is not specific for ILK. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to clarify the potential of QLT0267 as a targeted therapeutic in the clinic.
0 Reliability and validity of a new scale on internal coherence (ICS) of cancer patients. Current inventories on quality of life used in oncology mainly focus on functional aspects of patients in the context of disease adaptation and treatments (side) effects (EORTC QLQ C30) or generically the status of common functions (Medical Outcome Study SF 36). Beyond circumscribed dimensions of quality of life (i.e., physical, emotional, social, cognitive etc.), there is a lack of inventories which also address other relevant dimensions such as the 'sense of coherence' (SOC) in cancer patients. SOC is important because of its potential prognostic relevance in cancer patients, but the current SOC scale has mainly been validated for psychiatric and psychosomatic patients. Our two-step validation study addresses the internal coherence (ICS) scale, which is based on expert rating, using specific items for oncological patients, with respect to its reliability, validity and sensitivity to chemotherapy. The items were tested on 114 participants (57 cancer patients and a matched control group), alongside questions on autonomic regulation (aR), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), self-regulation (SRQ) and Karnofsky the Performance-Index (KPI). A retest of 65 participants was carried out after a median time span of four weeks.In the second part of the study, the ICS was used to assess internal coherence during chemotherapy in 25 patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and 17 breast cancer patients. ICS was recorded before, during and 4-8 weeks after treatment. The 10-item scale of 'internal coherence' (ICS) shows good to very good reliability: Cronbach-alpha r = 0.91, retest-reliability r = 0.80. The ICS correlates with r = 0.43-0.72 to the convergence criteria (all p < 0.001). We are able to show decreased ICS-values after the third cycle for CRC and breast cancer patients, with a subsequent increase of ICS scores after the end of chemotherapy. The ICS has good to very good reliability, validity and sensitivity to chemotherapy.
3 Limitation of using synthetic human odours to test mosquito repellents. Gold-standard tests of mosquito repellents involve exposing human volunteers to host-seeking mosquitoes, to assess the protective efficacy of the repellents. These techniques are not exposure-free and cannot be performed prior to toxicological evaluation. It is postulated that synthetic lures could provide a useful assay that mimics in-vivo conditions for use in high-throughput screening for mosquito repellents. This paper reports on a semi-field evaluation of repellents using a synthetic blend of human derived attractants for the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto Different concentrations of known repellents, N, N diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (deet) and Para-methane-3, 8, diol (PMD) were added into traps baited with the synthetic blend, and resulting changes in mosquito catches were measured. All test concentrations of deet (0.001% to 100%) reduced the attractiveness of the synthetic blend. However, PMD was repellent only at 0.25%. Above this concentration, it significantly increased the attractiveness of the blend. There was no relationship between the repellent concentrations and the change in mosquito catches when either deet (r2 = 0.033, P = 0.302) or PMD (r2 = 0.020, P = 0.578) was used. It is concluded that while some repellents may reduce the attractiveness of synthetic human odours, others may instead increase their attractiveness. Such inconsistencies indicate that even though the synthetic attractants may provide exposure-free and consistent test media for repellents, careful selection and multiple-repellent tests are necessary to ascertain their suitability for use in repellent screening. The synthetic odour blend tested here is not yet sufficiently refined to serve as replacement for humans in repellent testing, but may be developed further and evaluated in different formats for exposure free repellent testing purposes.
1 Inactivation and unfolding of the hyperthermophilic inorganic pyrophosphatase from Thermus thermophilus by sodium dodecyl sulfate. Inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase, EC 3.6.1.1) is an essential constitutive enzyme for energy metabolism and clearance of excess pyrophosphate. In this research, we investigated the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-induced inactivation and unfolding of PPase from Thermus thermophilus (T-PPase), a hyperthermophilic enzyme. The results indicated that like many other mesophilic enzymes, T-PPase could be fully inactivated at a low SDS concentration of 2 mM. Using an enzyme activity assay, SDS was shown to act as a mixed type reversible inhibitor, suggesting T-PPase contained specific SDS binding sites. At high SDS concentrations, T-PPase was denatured via a two-state process without the accumulation of any intermediate, as revealed by far-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence. A comparison of the inactivation and unfolding data suggested that the inhibition might be caused by the specific binding of the SDS molecules to the enzyme, while the unfolding might be caused by the cooperative non-specific binding of SDS to T-PPase. The possible molecular mechanisms underlying the mixed type inhibition by SDS was proposed to be caused by the local conformational changes or altered charge distributions.
1 Identification of non-muscle myosin heavy chain as a substrate for Cdk5 and tool for drug screening. Deregulated activation of cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5) is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. One of the restricting factors for developing specific Cdk5 inhibitors is the lack of reproducible and well-characterized cellular in vitro assay systems. HEK293 cells were transfected with Cdk5 and its activator p25 as a starting point for an assay to screen for Cdk5 kinase inhibitors. To identify suitable substrates for Cdk5 we utilized an antibody that recognizes phospho serine in a consensus motif for Cdk substrates. Western blot analysis of transfected cells detected a 200 kDa band that was identified, by mass spectrometry, as non-muscle myosin heavy chain, type B (NMHC-B). Phosphorylation of NMHC-B was evident only in cells that were double transfected with Cdk5/p25 and was dose-dependently inhibited by Roscovitine and other Cdk5 inhibitors. Cdk5 was found to phosphorylate NMHC-B also in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. A novel Cdk5 substrate NMHC-B was identified in this study. A cellular assay for screening of Cdk5 inhibitors was established using NMHC-B phosphorylation as a read-out in Cdk5/p25 transfected HEK293 cells. A novel Cdk5 inhibitor was also pharmacologically characterized in this assay system.
2 Erythropoietin mimics the acute phase response in critical illness. In a prospective observational study, we examined the temporal relationships between serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels, haemoglobin concentration and the inflammatory response in critically ill patients with and without acute renal failure (ARF). Twenty-five critically ill patients, from general and cardiac intensive care units (ICUs) in a university hospital, were studied. Eight had ARF and 17 had normal or mildly impaired renal function. The comparator group included 82 nonhospitalized patients with normal renal function and varying haemoglobin concentrations. In the patients, levels of haemoglobin, serum EPO, C-reactive protein, IL-1beta, IL-6, serum iron, ferritin, vitamin B12 and folate were measured, and Coombs test was performed from ICU admission until discharge or death. Concurrent EPO and haemoglobin levels were measured in the comparator group. EPO levels were initially high in patients with ARF, falling to normal or low levels by day 3. Thereafter, almost all ICU patients demonstrated normal or low EPO levels despite progressive anaemia. IL-6 exhibited a similar initial pattern, but levels remained elevated during the chronic phase of critical illness. IL-1beta was undetectable. Critically ill patients could not be distinguished from nonhospitalized anaemic patients on the basis of EPO levels. EPO levels are markedly elevated in the initial phase of critical illness with ARF. In the chronic phase of critical illness, EPO levels are the same for patients with and those without ARF, and cannot be distinguished from noncritically ill patients with varying haemoglobin concentrations. Exogenous EPO therapy is unlikely to be effective in the first few days of critical illness.
0 Transcriptional profiling in response to terminal drought stress reveals differential responses along the wheat genome. Water stress during grain filling has a marked effect on grain yield, leading to a reduced endosperm cell number and thus sink capacity to accumulate dry matter. The bread wheat cultivar Chinese Spring (CS), a Chinese Spring terminal deletion line (CS_5AL-10) and the durum wheat cultivar Creso were subjected to transcriptional profiling after exposure to mild and severe drought stress at the grain filling stage to find evidences of differential stress responses associated to different wheat genome regions. The transcriptome analysis of Creso, CS and its deletion line revealed 8,552 non redundant probe sets with different expression levels, mainly due to the comparisons between the two species. The drought treatments modified the expression of 3,056 probe sets. Besides a set of genes showing a similar drought response in Creso and CS, cluster analysis revealed several drought response features that can be associated to the different genomic structure of Creso, CS and CS_5AL-10. Some drought-related genes were expressed at lower level (or not expressed) in Creso (which lacks the D genome) or in the CS_5AL-10 deletion line compared to CS. The chromosome location of a set of these genes was confirmed by PCR-based mapping on the D genome (or the 5AL-10 region). Many clusters were characterized by different level of expression in Creso, CS and CS_AL-10, suggesting that the different genome organization of the three genotypes may affect plant adaptation to stress. Clusters with similar expression trend were grouped and functional classified to mine the biological mean of their activation or repression. Genes involved in ABA, proline, glycine-betaine and sorbitol pathways were found up-regulated by drought stress. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of a set of transposons and retrotransposons was detected in CS_5AL-10. Bread and durum wheat genotypes were characterized by a different physiological reaction to water stress and by a substantially different molecular response. The genome organization accounted for differences in the expression level of hundreds of genes located on the D genome or controlled by regulators located on the D genome. When a genomic stress (deletion of a chromosomal region) was combined with low water availability, a molecular response based on the activation of transposons and retrotransposons was observed.
0 Folding versus aggregation: polypeptide conformations on competing pathways. Protein aggregation has now become recognised as an important and generic aspect of protein energy landscapes. Since the discovery that numerous human diseases are caused by protein aggregation, the biophysical characterisation of misfolded states and their aggregation mechanisms has received increased attention. Utilising experimental techniques and computational approaches established for the analysis of protein folding reactions has ensured rapid advances in the study of pathways leading to amyloid fibrils and amyloid-related aggregates. Here we describe recent experimental and theoretical advances in the elucidation of the conformational properties of dynamic, heterogeneous and/or insoluble protein ensembles populated on complex, multidimensional protein energy landscapes. We discuss current understanding of aggregation mechanisms in this context and describe how the synergy between biochemical, biophysical and cell-biological experiments are beginning to provide detailed insights into the partitioning of non-native species between protein folding and aggregation pathways.
0 In silico evidence for functional specialization after genome duplication in yeast. A fairly recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) event in yeast enables the effects of gene duplication and subsequent functional divergence to be characterized. We examined 15 ohnolog pairs (i.e. paralogs from a WGD) out of c. 500 Saccharomyces cerevisiae ohnolog pairs that have persisted over an estimated 100 million years of evolution. These 15 pairs were chosen for their high levels of asymmetry, i.e. within the pair, one ohnolog had evolved much faster than the other. Sequence comparisons of the 15 pairs revealed that the faster evolving duplicated genes typically appear to have experienced partially--but not fully--relaxed negative selection as evidenced by an average nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratio (dN/dS(avg)=0.44) that is higher than the slow-evolving genes' ratio (dN/dS(avg)=0.14) but still <1. Increased number of insertions and deletions in the fast-evolving genes also indicated loosened structural constraints. Sequence and structural comparisons indicated that a subset of these pairs had significant differences in their catalytically important residues and active or cofactor-binding sites. A literature survey revealed that several of the fast-evolving genes have gained a specialized function. Our results indicate that subfunctionalization and even neofunctionalization has occurred along with degenerative evolution, in which unneeded functions were destroyed by mutations.
3 Development of an integrative database with 499 novel microsatellite markers for Macaca fascicularis. Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are a valuable resource for linkage studies of genetic disorders, but their microsatellite markers are not sufficient. In genetic studies, a prerequisite for mapping genes is development of a genome-wide set of microsatellite markers in target organisms. A whole genome sequence and its annotation also facilitate identification of markers for causative mutations. The aim of this study is to establish hundreds of microsatellite markers and to develop an integrative cynomolgus macaque genome database with a variety of datasets including marker and gene information that will be useful for further genetic analyses in this species. We investigated the level of polymorphisms in cynomolgus monkeys for 671 microsatellite markers that are covered by our established Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones. Four hundred and ninety-nine (74.4%) of the markers were found to be polymorphic using standard PCR analysis. The average number of alleles and average expected heterozygosity at these polymorphic loci in ten cynomolgus macaques were 8.20 and 0.75, respectively. BAC clones and novel microsatellite markers were assigned to the rhesus genome sequence and linked with our cynomolgus macaque cDNA database (QFbase). Our novel microsatellite marker set and genomic database will be valuable integrative resources in analyzing genetic disorders in cynomolgus macaques.
3 Independent cadherin-catenin and Bazooka clusters interact to assemble adherens junctions. Proper epithelial structure requires adherens junction (AJ) assembly. In the early Drosophila embryo, AJ assembly depends on Bazooka (Baz; PAR-3), but it is unclear how Baz affects AJ assembly and what precursors are involved. To understand this process at the molecular level, we counted the number of core AJ proteins and Baz proteins at an average spot AJ (SAJ) and determined their dynamics with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments. These data reveal that SAJs are subdivided into Baz clusters and cadherin-catenin clusters with independent protein numbers and dynamics. This independence suggests that precursory cadherin-catenin clusters might form before SAJ assembly. We identify cadherin-catenin clusters forming between apical microvilli. Further analyses show that they form independently of Baz and that Baz functions in repositioning them to apicolateral sites for full SAJ assembly. Our data implicate cell protrusions in initial cadherin-catenin clustering in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Then, independent Baz clusters appear to engage the cadherin-catenin clusters to assemble SAJs.
0 The highly conserved serine threonine kinase StkP of Streptococcus pneumoniae contributes to penicillin susceptibility independently from genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The serine/threonine kinase StkP of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major virulence factor in the mouse model of infection. StkP is a modular protein with a N-terminal kinase domain a C-terminal PASTA domain carrying the signature of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) and prokaryotic serine threonine kinase. In laboratory cultures, one target of StkP is the phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM involved in the first steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. In order to further elucidate the importance of StkP in S. pneumoniae, its role in resistance to beta-lactams has been assessed by mutational analysis in laboratory cultures and its genetic conservation has been investigated in isolates from infected sites (virulent), asymptomatic carriers, susceptible and non-susceptible to beta-lactams. Deletion replacement mutation in stkP conferred hypersensitivity to penicillin G and was epistatic on mutations in PBP2X, PBP2B and PBP1A from the resistant 9V clinical isolate URA1258. Genetic analysis of 55 clinical isolates identified 11 StkP alleles differing from the reference R6 allele. None relevant mutation in the kinase or the PASTA domains were found to account for susceptibility of the isolates. Rather the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the strains appeared to be determined by their PBP alleles. The results of genetic dissection analysis in lab strain Cp1015 reveal that StkP is involved in the bacterial response to penicillin and is epistatic on mutations PBP 2B, 2X and 1A. However analysis of the clinical isolates did not allow us to find the StkP alleles putatively involved in determining the virulence or the resistance level of a given strain, suggesting a strong conservation of StkP in clinical isolates.
0 Viral communities associated with healthy and bleaching corals. The coral holobiont is the integrated assemblage of the coral animal, its symbiotic algae, protists, fungi and a diverse consortium of Bacteria and Archaea. Corals are a model system for the study of symbiosis, the breakdown of which can result in disease and mortality. Little is known, however, about viruses that infect corals and their symbionts. Here we present metagenomic analyses of the viral communities associated with healthy and partially bleached specimens of the Caribbean reef-building coral Diploria strigosa. Surprisingly, herpes-like sequences accounted for 4-8% of the total sequences in each metagenome; this abundance of herpes-like sequences is unprecedented in other marine viral metagenomes. Viruses similar to those that infect algae and plants were also present in the coral viral assemblage. Among the phage identified, cyanophages were abundant in both healthy and bleaching corals and vibriophages were also present. Therefore, coral-associated viruses could potentially infect all components of the holobiont--coral, algal and microbial. Thus, we expect viruses to figure prominently in the preservation and breakdown of coral health.
3 Lipoproteins, cholesterol homeostasis and cardiac health. Cholesterol is an essential substance involved in many functions, such as maintaining cell membranes, manufacturing vitamin D on surface of the skin, producing hormones, and possibly helping cell connections in the brain. When cholesterol levels rise in the blood, they can, however, have dangerous consequences. In particular, cholesterol has generated considerable notoriety for its causative role in atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in developed countries around the world. Homeostasis of cholesterol is centered on the metabolism of lipoproteins, which mediate transport of the lipid to and from tissues. As a synopsis of the major events and proteins that manage lipoprotein homeostasis, this review contributes to the substantial attention that has recently been directed to this area. Despite intense scrutiny, the majority of phenotypic variation in total cholesterol and related traits eludes explanation by current genetic knowledge. This is somewhat disappointing considering heritability estimates have established these traits as highly genetic. Thus, the continued search for candidate genes, mutations, and mechanisms is vital to our understanding of heart disease at the molecular level. Furthermore, as marker development continues to predict risk of vascular illness, this knowledge has the potential to revolutionize treatment of this leading human disease.
1 Evaluation of the performance of tests for spatial randomness on prostate cancer data. Spatial global clustering tests can be used to evaluate the geographical distribution of health outcomes. The power of several of these tests has been evaluated and compared using simulated data, but their performance using real unadjusted data and data adjusted for individual- and area-level covariates has not been reported previously.We evaluated data on prostate cancer histologic tumor grade and stage of disease at diagnosis for incident cases of prostate cancer reported to the Maryland Cancer Registry during 1992-1997. We analyzed unadjusted data as well as expected counts from models that were adjusted for individual-level covariates (race, age and year of diagnosis) and area-level covariates (census block group median household income and a county-level socioeconomic index). We chose 3 spatial clustering tests that are commonly used to evaluate the geographic distribution of disease: Cuzick-Edwards' k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) test, Moran's I and Tango's MEET (Maximized Excess Events Test). For both grade and stage at diagnosis, we found that Cuzick-Edwards' k-NN and Moran's I were very sensitive to the percent of population parameter selected. For stage at diagnosis, all three tests showed that the models with individual- and area-level adjustments reduced clustering the most, but did not reduce it entirely. Based on this specific example, results suggest that these tests provide useful tools for evaluating spatial clustering of disease characteristics, both before and after consideration of covariates.
0 Hes1 is expressed in the second heart field and is required for outflow tract development. Rapid growth of the embryonic heart occurs by addition of progenitor cells of the second heart field to the poles of the elongating heart tube. Failure or perturbation of this process leads to congenital heart defects. In order to provide further insight into second heart field development we characterized the insertion site of a transgene expressed in the second heart field and outflow tract as the result of an integration site position effect. Here we show that the integration site of the A17-Myf5-nlacZ-T55 transgene lies upstream of Hes1, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix containing transcriptional repressor required for the maintenance of diverse progenitor cell populations during embryonic development. Transgene expression in a subset of Hes1 expression sites, including the CNS, pharyngeal epithelia, pericardium, limb bud and lung endoderm suggests that Hes1 is the endogenous target of regulatory elements trapped by the transgene. Hes1 is expressed in pharyngeal endoderm and mesoderm including the second heart field. Analysis of Hes1 mutant hearts at embryonic day 15.5 reveals outflow tract alignment defects including ventricular septal defects and overriding aorta. At earlier developmental stages, Hes1 mutant embryos display defects in second heart field proliferation, a reduction in cardiac neural crest cells and failure to completely extend the outflow tract. Hes1 is expressed in cardiac progenitor cells in the early embryo and is required for development of the arterial pole of the heart.
2 Clinical review: Severe malaria. Malaria represents a medical emergency because it may rapidly progress to complications and death without prompt and appropriate treatment. Severe malaria is almost exclusively caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The incidence of imported malaria is increasing and the case fatality rate remains high despite progress in intensive care and antimalarial treatment. Clinical deterioration usually appears 3-7 days after onset of fever. Complications involve the nervous, respiratory, renal, and/or hematopoietic systems. Metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia are common systemic complications. Intravenous quinine and quinidine are the most widely used drugs in the initial treatment of severe falciparum malaria, whereas artemisinin derivatives are currently recommended for quinine-resistant cases. As soon as the patient is clinically stable and able to swallow, oral treatment should be given. The intravascular volume should be maintained at the lowest level sufficient for adequate systemic perfusion to prevent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Renal replacement therapy should be initiated early. Exchange blood transfusion has been suggested for the treatment of patients with severe malaria and high parasitemia. For early diagnosis, it is paramount to consider malaria in every febrile patient with a history of travel in an area endemic for malaria.
3 Equity for open-access journal publishing. Open-access journals, which provide access to their scholarly articles freely and without limitations, are at a systematic disadvantage relative to traditional closed-access journal publishing and its subscription-based business model. A simple, cost-effective remedy to this inequity could put open-access publishing on a path to become a sustainable, efficient system.
1 Hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) in Italy. The aim of our study was to trace the dynamic changes of hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) lineages in Italy, comparing the genotypic backgrounds of contemporary isolates over a period of 17 years, with those of a sample of early MRSA strains from 1980. In total, 301 non-repetitive MRSA clinical isolates, recovered from 19 Italian hospitals between 1990 and 2007 were selected and analyzed for their antibiotic resistance, typed by PFGE and SCCmec, grouped into clonal-types and further characterized using Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). A sample of fifteen early MRSA strains from 1980 was also used for comparison. The most interesting feature was the recent increase of ST228-MRSA-I (formerly the Italian clone; PFGE E) over the period 2000-2007 (57%), when compared to the period 1990-1999 (29%), and its stability to date, associated with a decrease of the highly epidemic ST247-MRSA-IA (formerly the Iberian clone; PFGE A), (23% from 1990 to 1999, 6% from 2000 to 2007). ST1-MRSA-I (1 out of 2 strains carrying ccrA2B2), ST8-MRSA-I (4 strains), ST15-MRSA-I (1 out of 4 carrying ccrA2B2) and ST30-MRSA-I (2 out of 5 carrying no ccrAB-types and ccrC) were the predominant earliest STs among the MRSA strains in 1980. A temporal shift in the susceptibility levels to glycopeptides was observed: strains with vancomycin MIC of >or= 2 mg/L increased from 19.4% to 35.5%. In conclusion, we describe the alternation of MRSA clones that occurred in hospitals from 1990 to 2007 and the increase of the glycopeptide MIC levels, reflecting a worldwide trend. We document the detection of ST1, ST8, ST15 and ST30 in the 1980 isolates; we hypothesize their possible latency and their appearance as the current CA-MRSA clones.
0 Instrumental music influences recognition of emotional body language. In everyday life, emotional events are perceived by multiple sensory systems. Research has shown that recognition of emotions in one modality is biased towards the emotion expressed in a simultaneously presented but task irrelevant modality. In the present study, we combine visual and auditory stimuli that convey similar affective meaning but have a low probability of co-occurrence in everyday life. Dynamic face-blurred whole body expressions of a person grasping an object while expressing happiness or sadness are presented in combination with fragments of happy or sad instrumental classical music. Participants were instructed to categorize the emotion expressed by the visual stimulus. The results show that recognition of body language is influenced by the auditory stimuli. These findings indicate that crossmodal influences as previously observed for audiovisual speech can also be obtained from the ignored auditory to the attended visual modality in audiovisual stimuli that consist of whole bodies and music.
1 Approach to the diagnosis and management of suspected exercise-induced bronchoconstriction by primary care physicians. Exercise-related respiratory symptoms in the diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) have poor predictive value. The aim of this study was to evaluate how athletes presenting with these symptoms are diagnosed and managed in primary care. An electronic survey was distributed to a random selection of family practitioners in England. The survey was designed to assess the frequency with which family practitioners encounter adults with exercise-related respiratory symptoms and how they would approach diagnostic work-up and management. The survey also evaluated awareness of and access to diagnostic tests in this setting and general knowledge of prescribing asthma treatments to competitive athletes. 257 family practitioners completed the online survey. One-third of respondents indicated they encountered individuals with this problem at a frequency of more than one case per month. Over two-thirds of family practitioners chose investigation as an initial management strategy, while one-quarter would initiate treatment based on clinical information alone. PEFR pre- and post-exercise was the most commonly selected test for investigation (44%), followed by resting spirometry pre- and post-bronchodilator (35%). Short-acting beta2-agonists were the most frequently selected choice of treatment indicated by respondents (90%). Family practitioners encounter individuals with exercise-related respiratory symptoms commonly and although objective testing is often employed in diagnostic work-up, the tests most frequently utilised are not the most accurate for diagnosis of EIB. This diagnostic approach may be dictated by the reported lack of access to more precise testing methods, or may reflect a lack of dissemination or awareness of current evidence. Overall the findings have implications both for the management and hence welfare of athletes presenting with this problem to family practitioners and also for the competitive athletes requiring therapeutic use exemption.
0 How does treatment satisfaction work?: Modeling determinants of treatment satisfaction and preference. OBJECTIVE This study tested a model hypothesizing that treatment affects objective clinical outcomes, which in turn affect perceived consequences, which in turn affect satisfaction and preference judgments. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The model was tested in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in which 266 patients with type 1 diabetes added active or placebo pramlintide to their insulin regimens. Objective clinical outcomes included changes in glucose and weight control, insulin requirements, incidence of hypoglycemia, and study drug tolerance. At the end of the trial, patients completed the validated PRAM-TSQ questionnaire measuring treatment satisfaction and preference and perceived medication benefits and side effects. RESULTS Statistical modeling demonstrated that active pramlintide was significantly associated with greater treatment satisfaction, preference, and perceived benefits (all except hypoglycemia prevention), as well as objective clinical outcomes (weight loss, lower postprandial glucose [PPG], lower medication tolerance, more hypoglycemia). Perceptions of treatment consequences were sensitive and specific to their cognate objective clinical outcomes (no halo effects). Clinical outcomes (especially PPG) accounted for almost half of the effect of the study medication on treatment satisfaction and preference. Treatment satisfaction and preference were strongly related to the perceived benefits/side effects of the study medication, and these perceptions (especially glucose control) mediated most of the association of clinical outcomes with satisfaction and preference. CONCLUSIONS This model received substantial empirical support. Improvements in objective clinical outcomes accounted for a large part of the association of pramlintide treatment with higher treatment satisfaction and preference. Perceived treatment consequences mediated the effect of objective clinical benefits on satisfaction with and preference for the study medication.
3 Groucho binds two conserved regions of LEF-1 for HDAC-dependent repression. Drosophila Groucho and its human Transducin-like-Enhancer of Split orthologs (TLEs) function as transcription co-repressors within the context of Wnt signaling, a pathway with strong links to cancer. The current model for how Groucho/TLE's modify Wnt signaling is by direct competition with beta-catenin for LEF/TCF binding. The molecular events involved in this competitive interaction are not defined and the actions of Groucho/TLEs within the context of Wnt-linked cancer are unknown. We used in vitro protein interaction assays with the LEF/TCF family member LEF-1, and in vivo assays with Wnt reporter plasmids to define Groucho/TLE interaction and repressor function. Mapping studies reveal that Groucho/TLE binds two regions in LEF-1. The primary site of recognition is a 20 amino acid region in the Context Dependent Regulatory domain. An auxiliary site is in the High Mobility Group DNA binding domain. Mutation of an eight amino acid sequence within the primary region (RFSHHMIP) results in a loss of Groucho action in a transient reporter assay. Drosophila Groucho, human TLE-1, and a truncated human TLE isoform Amino-enhancer-of-split (AES), work equivalently to repress LEF-1*beta-catenin transcription in transient reporter assays, and these actions are sensitive to the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A. A survey of Groucho/TLE action in a panel of six colon cancer cell lines with elevated beta-catenin shows that Groucho is not able to repress transcription in a subset of these cell lines. Our data shows that Groucho/TLE repression requires two sites of interaction in LEF-1 and that a central, conserved amino acid sequence within the primary region (F S/T/P/xx y I/L/V) is critical. Our data also reveals that AES opposes LEF-1 transcription activation and that both Groucho and AES repression require histone deacetylase activity suggesting multiple steps in Groucho competition with beta-catenin. The variable ability of Groucho/TLE to oppose Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells suggests there may be defects in one or more of these steps.
0 Pathogenesis of tendinopathies: inflammation or degeneration? The intrinsic pathogenetic mechanisms of tendinopathies are largely unknown and whether inflammation or degeneration has the prominent role is still a matter of debate. Assuming that there is a continuum from physiology to pathology, overuse may be considered as the initial disease factor; in this context, microruptures of tendon fibers occur and several molecules are expressed, some of which promote the healing process, while others, including inflammatory cytokines, act as disease mediators. Neural in-growth that accompanies the neovessels explains the occurrence of pain and triggers neurogenic-mediated inflammation. It is conceivable that inflammation and degeneration are not mutually exclusive, but work together in the pathogenesis of tendinopathies.
1 Do uric acid deposits in zooxanthellae function as eye-spots? The symbiosis between zooxanthellae (dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium) and corals is a fundamental basis of tropical marine ecosystems. However the physiological interactions of the hosts and symbionts are poorly understood. Recently, intracellular crystalline deposits in Symbiodinium were revealed to be uric acid functioning for nutrient storage. This is the first exploration of these enigmatic crystalline materials that had previously been misidentified as oxalic acid, providing new insights into the nutritional strategies of Symbiodinium in oligotrophic tropical waters. However, we believe these deposits also function as eye-spots on the basis of light and electron microscopic observations of motile cells of cultured Symbiodinium. The cells possessed crystalline deposit clusters in rows with each row 100-150 nm thick corresponding to 1/4 the wavelength of light and making them suitable for maximum wave interference and reflection of light. Crystalline clusters in cells observed with a light microscope strongly refracted and polarized light, and reflected or absorbed short wavelength light. The facts that purines, including uric acid, have been identified as the main constituents of light reflectors in many organisms, and that the photoreceptor protein, opsin, was detected in our Symbiodinium strain, support the idea that uric acid deposits in Symbiodinium motile cells may function as a component of an eye-spot.
0 The repertoire of G-protein-coupled receptors in Xenopus tropicalis. The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily represents the largest protein family in the human genome. These proteins have a variety of physiological functions that give them well recognized roles in clinical medicine. In Xenopus tropicalis, a widely used animal model for physiology research, the repertoire of GPCRs may help link the GPCR evolutionary history in vertebrates from teleost fish to mammals. We have identified 1452 GPCRs in the X. tropicalis genome. Phylogenetic analyses classified these receptors into the following seven families: Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled, Secretin, Taste 2 and Vomeronasal 1. Nearly 70% of X. tropicalis GPCRs are represented by the following three types of receptors thought to receive chemosensory information from the outside world: olfactory, vomeronasal 1 and vomeronasal 2 receptors. X. tropicalis shares a more similar repertoire of GPCRs with mammals than it does with fish. An examination of the three major groups of receptors related to olfactory/pheromone detection shows that in X. tropicalis, these groups have undergone lineage specific expansion. A comparison of GPCRs in X. tropicalis, teleost fish and mammals reveals the GPCR evolutionary history in vertebrates.
0 Insights into the role of Val45 and Gln182 of Escherichia coli MutY in DNA substrate binding and specificity. Escherichia coli MutY (EcMutY) reduces mutagenesis by removing adenines paired with guanines or 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanines (8-oxoG). V45 and Q182 of EcMutY are considered to be the key determinants of adenine specificity. Both residues are spatially close to each other in the active site and are conserved in MutY family proteins but not in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Mig.MthI T/G mismatch DNA glycosylase (A50 and L187 at the corresponding respective positions). Targeted mutagenesis study was performed to determine the substrate specificities of V45A, Q182L, and V45A/Q182L double mutant of EcMutY. All three mutants had significantly lower binding and glycosylase activities for A/G and A/8-oxoG mismatches than the wild-type enzyme. The double mutant exhibited an additive reduction in binding to both the A/G and A/GO in comparison to the single mutants. These mutants were also tested for binding and glycosylase activities with T/G- or T/8-oxoG-containing DNA. Both V45A and Q182L mutants had substantially increased affinities towards T/G, however, they did not exhibit any T/G or T/8-oxoG glycosylase activity. Surprisingly, the V45A/Q182L double mutant had similar binding affinities to T/G as the wild-type EcMutY. V45A, Q182L, and V45A/Q182L EcMutY mutants could not reduce the G:C to T:A mutation frequency of a mutY mutant. Expression of the V45A mutant protein caused a dominant negative phenotype with an increased G:C to A:T mutation frequency. The substrate specificities are altered in V45A, Q182L, and V45A/Q182L EcMutY mutants. V45A and Q182L mutants had reduced binding and glycosylase activities for A/G and A/8-oxoG mismatches and increased affinities towards T/G mismatch. However, in contrast to a previous report that Mig.MthI thymine DNA glycosylase can be converted to a MutY-like adenine glycosylase by replacing two residues (A50V and L187Q), both V45A and Q182L EcMutY mutants did not exhibit any T/G or T/8-oxoG glycosylase activity. The dominant negative phenotype of V45A EcMutY mutant protein is probably caused by its increased binding affinity to T/G mismatch and thus inhibiting other repair pathways.
3 California wildfires of 2008: coarse and fine particulate matter toxicity. During the last week of June 2008, central and northern California experienced thousands of forest and brush fires, giving rise to a week of severe fire-related particulate air pollution throughout the region. California experienced PM(10-2.5) (particulate matter with mass median aerodynamic diameter > 2.5 mum to < 10 mum; coarse ) and PM(2.5) (particulate matter with mass median aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 mum; fine) concentrations greatly in excess of the air quality standards and among the highest values reported at these stations since data have been collected. These observations prompt a number of questions about the health impact of exposure to elevated levels of PM(10-2.5) and PM(2.5) and about the specific toxicity of PM arising from wildfires in this region. Toxicity of PM(10-2.5) and PM(2.5) obtained during the time of peak concentrations of smoke in the air was determined with a mouse bioassay and compared with PM samples collected under normal conditions from the region during the month of June 2007. Concentrations of PM were not only higher during the wildfire episodes, but the PM was much more toxic to the lung on an equal weight basis than was PM collected from normal ambient air in the region. Toxicity was manifested as increased neutrophils and protein in lung lavage and by histologic indicators of increased cell influx and edema in the lung. We conclude that the wildfire PM contains chemical components toxic to the lung, especially to alveolar macrophages, and they are more toxic to the lung than equal doses of PM collected from ambient air from the same region during a comparable season.
0 Combining specificity determining and conserved residues improves functional site prediction. Predicting the location of functionally important sites from protein sequence and/or structure is a long-standing problem in computational biology. Most current approaches make use of sequence conservation, assuming that amino acid residues conserved within a protein family are most likely to be functionally important. Most often these approaches do not consider many residues that act to define specific sub-functions within a family, or they make no distinction between residues important for function and those more relevant for maintaining structure (e.g. in the hydrophobic core). Many protein families bind and/or act on a variety of ligands, meaning that conserved residues often only bind a common ligand sub-structure or perform general catalytic activities. Here we present a novel method for functional site prediction based on identification of conserved positions, as well as those responsible for determining ligand specificity. We define Specificity-Determining Positions (SDPs), as those occupied by conserved residues within sub-groups of proteins in a family having a common specificity, but differ between groups, and are thus likely to account for specific recognition events. We benchmark the approach on enzyme families of known 3D structure with bound substrates, and find that in nearly all families residues predicted by SDPsite are in contact with the bound substrate, and that the addition of SDPs significantly improves functional site prediction accuracy. We apply SDPsite to various families of proteins containing known three-dimensional structures, but lacking clear functional annotations, and discusse several illustrative examples. The results suggest a better means to predict functional details for the thousands of protein structures determined prior to a clear understanding of molecular function.
0 Channel-like slippage modes in the human anion/proton exchanger ClC-4. The ClC family encompasses two classes of proteins with distinct transport functions: anion channels and transporters. ClC-type transporters usually mediate secondary active anion-proton exchange. However, under certain conditions they assume slippage mode behavior in which proton and anion transport are uncoupled, resulting in passive anion fluxes without associated proton movements. Here, we use patch clamp and intracellular pH recordings on transfected mammalian cells to characterize exchanger and slippage modes of human ClC-4, a member of the ClC transporter branch. We found that the two transport modes differ in transport mechanisms and transport rates. Nonstationary noise analysis revealed a unitary transport rate of 5 x 10(5) s(-1) at +150 mV for the slippage mode, indicating that ClC-4 functions as channel in this mode. In the exchanger mode, unitary transport rates were 10-fold lower. Both ClC-4 transport modes exhibit voltage-dependent gating, indicating that there are active and non-active states for the exchanger as well as for the slippage mode. ClC-4 can assume both transport modes under all tested conditions, with exchanger/channel ratios determined by the external anion. We propose that binding of transported anions to non-active states causes transition from slippage into exchanger mode. Binding and unbinding of anions is very rapid, and slower transitions of liganded and non-liganded states into active conformations result in a stable distribution between the two transport modes. The proposed mechanism results in anion-dependent conversion of ClC-type exchanger into an anion channel with typical attributes of ClC anion channels.
1 Initial characterization of Pf62, a novel protein of Plasmodium falciparum identified by immunoscreening. In order to find new antigens from Plasmodium falciparum, a complementary DNA (cDNA) library was constructed and screened. The study of expression library of P. falciparum was performed in an attempt to identify new antigens that could have potential relevance for the falciparum-malaria diagnosis and/or protection. Between the positive clones detected (ring erythrocyte surface antigen, merozoite erythrocyte surface antigen, RHOP H3, CSP, LSA), a new gene that correspond to a new protein (Pf62) was isolated and characterized. This antigen was useful for the diagnosis of malaria in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. The cDNA corresponding to this antigen and structure of the gene were characterized. Pf62 is a single copy gene that contains one exon. The Pf62 cDNA has an open reading frame of 1,599 nucleotides that code for a putative protein of 532 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kDa. The polypeptide contains in the central section two regions of repeats of 21 and 19 amino acids, respectively. The localization of the Pf62 protein was performed by immunoblot, indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunoelectron microscopy. Pf62 is localized in the cytoplasm of the parasite and also on the surface of the infected erythrocyte. Serologic assays by using synthetic peptides designed from different antigenic regions of the Pf62 protein resulted in acceptable data of sensitivity and specificity in symptomatic malaria patients.
0 Independent and high-level dual-gene expression in adult stem-progenitor cells from a single lentiviral vector. Expression of multiple genes from the same target cell is required in several technological and therapeutic applications such as quantitative measurements of promoter activity or in vivo tracking of stem cells. In spite of such need, reaching independent and high-level dual-gene expression cannot be reliably accomplished by current gene transfer vehicles. To address this issue, we designed a lentiviral vector carrying two transcriptional units separated by polyadenylation, terminator and insulator sequences. With this design, the expression level of both genes was as high as that yielded from lentiviral vectors containing only a single transcriptional unit. Similar results were observed with several promoters and cell types including epidermal keratinocytes, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and hair follicle stem cells. Notably, we demonstrated quantitative dynamic monitoring of gene expression in primary cells with no need for selection protocols suggesting that this optimized lentivirus may be useful in high-throughput gene expression profiling studies.
3 Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) from marine natural products: the current situation and future prospects. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of more than twenty five secreted and membrane-bound zinc-endopeptidases which can degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) components. They also play important roles in a variety of biological and pathological processes. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) have been identified as potential therapeutic candidates for metastasis, arthritis, chronic inflammation and wrinkle formation. Up to present, more than 20,000 new compounds have been isolated from marine organisms, where considerable numbers of these naturally occurring derivatives are developed as potential candidates for pharmaceutical application. Eventhough the quantity of marine derived MMPIs is less when compare with the MMPIs derived from terrestrial materials, huge potential for bioactivity of these marine derived MMPIs has lead to large number of researches. Saccharoids, flavonoids and polyphones, fatty acids are the most important groups of MMPIs derived from marine natural products. In this review we focus on the progress of MMPIs from marine natural products.
0 Homozygosity and risk of childhood death due to invasive bacterial disease. Genetic heterozygosity is increasingly being shown to be a key predictor of fitness in natural populations, both through inbreeding depression, inbred individuals having low heterozygosity, and also through chance linkage between a marker and a gene under balancing selection. One important component of fitness that is often highlighted is resistance to parasites and other pathogens. However, the significance of equivalent loci in human populations remains unclear. Consequently, we performed a case-control study of fatal invasive bacterial disease in Kenyan children using a genome-wide screen with microsatellite markers. 148 cases, comprising children aged <13 years who died of invasive bacterial disease, (variously, bacteraemia, bacterial meningitis or neonatal sepsis) and 137 age-matched, healthy children were sampled in a prospective study conducted at Kilifi District Hospital, Kenya. Samples were genotyped for 134 microsatellite markers using the ABI LD20 marker set and analysed for an association between homozygosity and mortality. At five markers homozygosity was strongly associated with mortality (odds ratio range 4.7 - 12.2) with evidence of interactions between some markers. Mortality was associated with different non-overlapping marker groups in Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial disease. Homozygosity at susceptibility markers was common (prevalence 19-49%) and, with the large effect sizes, this suggests that bacterial disease mortality may be strongly genetically determined. Balanced polymorphisms appear to be more widespread in humans than previously appreciated and play a critical role in modulating susceptibility to infectious disease. The effect sizes we report, coupled with the stochasticity of exposure to pathogens suggests that infection and mortality are far from random due to a strong genetic basis.
0 Cytochrome P450 CYP1A1: wider roles in cancer progression and prevention. CYP1A1 is one of the main cytochrome P450 enzymes, examined extensively for its capacity to activate compounds with carcinogenic properties. Continuous exposure to inhalation chemicals and environmental carcinogens is thought to increase the level of CYP1A1 expression in extrahepatic tissues, through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Although the latter has long been recognized as a ligand-induced transcription factor, which is responsible for the xenobiotic activating pathway of several phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes, recent evidence suggests that the AhR is involved in various cell signaling pathways critical to cell cycle regulation and normal homeostasis. Disregulation of these pathways is implicated in tumor progression. In addition, it is becoming increasingly evident that CYP1A1 plays an important role in the detoxication of environmental carcinogens, as well as in the metabolic activation of dietary compounds with cancer preventative activity. Ultimately the contribution of CYP1A1 to cancer progression or prevention may depend on the balance of procarcinogen activation/detoxication and dietary natural product extrahepatic metabolism.
2 Evaluation of nonlinear frequency compression: clinical outcomes. This study evaluated prototype multichannel nonlinear frequency compression (NFC) signal processing on listeners with high-frequency hearing loss. This signal processor applies NFC above a cut-off frequency. The participants were hearing-impaired adults (13) and children (11) with sloping, high-frequency hearing loss. Multiple outcome measures were repeated using a modified withdrawal design. These included speech sound detection, speech recognition, and self-reported preference measures. Group level results provide evidence of significant improvement of consonant and plural recognition when NFC was enabled. Vowel recognition did not change significantly. Analysis of individual results allowed for exploration of individual factors contributing to benefit received from NFC processing. Findings suggest that NFC processing can improve high frequency speech detection and speech recognition ability for adult and child listeners. Variability in individual outcomes related to factors such as degree and configuration of hearing loss, age of participant, and type of outcome measure.
0 The role of cellular oxidative stress in regulating glycolysis energy metabolism in hepatoma cells. The Warburg effect has been found in a wide spectrum of human cancers, however the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. This study aims to explore the role of cellular oxidative stress in relation to glycolysis and the Warburg effect in hepatoma cells. Various cell lines combining environmental hypoxia was used as an in vitro model to mimic tumor microenvironment in vivo. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) and xanthine oxidase (XO) gene transfection were used to produce various cellular redox levels. 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCF) fluorescence and ESR spectrum were used to detect cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). We found that endogenous or exogenous interference with the cellular oxidative stress can sensitively regulate glycolysis and the Warburg effect in hepatoma cells. Hepatoma cells displayed a high level of free radicals compared to immortalized normal hepatocyte cells. Increasing the level of ROS stress in hepatoma cells can directly upregulate HIF-1 and activate glycolysis without requirement of a hypoxic condition. This explains the mechanism whereby aerobic glycolysis, i.e. the Warburg effect arises. Either endogenously upregulating SOD or exogenously administration with antioxidant can, through downregulating ROS level, effectively regulate energy pathways in hepatoma cells and can inhibit the growth of tumor cells and xenograft tumors. This study suggests that the Warburg effect was related to an inherently high level of cellular ROS and HIF-1. Hepatoma cells adaptation to hypoxia for survival and rapid growth exploits oxidative stress ectopically activated glycolysis to compensate the energy supply. This specific mechanism in which tumor cells through cellular oxidative stress activate glycolysis to meet their energy metabolism requirement could be exploited to selectively kill tumor cells.
1 Changes of functional MRI findings in a patient whose pathological gambling improved with fluvoxamine. Legalized gambling is a growing industry, and is probably a factor in the presently increasing prevalence of pathological gambling. We present a case of a 36-year-old pathological gambler who was treated with fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and who was assessed by functional MRI before and after drug administration. During activation periods, the pathological gambler was shown cards as stimuli, and fMRI results in several brain regions showed differential effects before and after medication and a maintenance period. This case demonstrates that the treatment response to fluvoxamine in a pathological gambler was observed not only by subjective self-report, but also by objective fMRI results. Therefore, fMRI may be a useful tool in the diagnosis and prediction of treatment response in patients afflicted with pathological gambling.
0 The novel RASSF6 and RASSF10 candidate tumour suppressor genes are frequently epigenetically inactivated in childhood leukaemias. The Ras-association family (RASSF) of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) contains 10 members that encode proteins containing Ras-association (RA) domains. Several members of the RASSF family are frequently epigenetically inactivated in cancer, however, their role in leukaemia has remained largely uninvestigated. Also, RASSF10 is a predicted gene yet to be experimentally verified. Here we cloned, characterised and demonstrated expression of RASSF10 in normal human bone marrow. We also determined the methylation status of CpG islands associated with RASSF1-10 in a series of childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemias (ALL) and normal blood and bone marrow samples. COBRA and bisulphite sequencing revealed RASSF6 and RASSF10 were the only RASSF members with a high frequency of leukaemia-specific methylation. RASSF6 was methylated in 94% (48/51) B-ALL and 41% (12/29) T-ALL, whilst RASSF10 was methylated in 16% (8/51) B-ALL and 88% (23/26) T-ALL. RASSF6 and RASSF10 expression inversely correlated with methylation which was restored by treatment with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5azaDC). This study shows the hypermethylation profile of RASSF genes in leukaemias is distinct from that of solid tumours and represents the first report of inactivation of RASSF6 or RASSF10 in cancer. These data show epigenetic inactivation of the candidate TSGs RASSF6 and RASSF10 is an extremely frequent event in the pathogenesis of childhood leukaemia. This study also warrants further investigation of the newly identified RASSF member RASSF10 and its potential role in leukaemia.
0 A missense mutation in the SERPINH1 gene in Dachshunds with osteogenesis imperfecta. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary disease occurring in humans and dogs. It is characterized by extremely fragile bones and teeth. Most human and some canine OI cases are caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes encoding the subunits of collagen I. Recently, mutations in the CRTAP and LEPRE1 genes were found to cause some rare forms of human OI. Many OI cases exist where the causative mutation has not yet been found. We investigated Dachshunds with an autosomal recessive form of OI. Genotyping only five affected dogs on the 50 k canine SNP chip allowed us to localize the causative mutation to a 5.82 Mb interval on chromosome 21 by homozygosity mapping. Haplotype analysis of five additional carriers narrowed the interval further down to 4.74 Mb. The SERPINH1 gene is located within this interval and encodes an essential chaperone involved in the correct folding of the collagen triple helix. Therefore, we considered SERPINH1 a positional and functional candidate gene and performed mutation analysis in affected and control Dachshunds. A missense mutation (c.977C>T, p.L326P) located in an evolutionary conserved domain was perfectly associated with the OI phenotype. We thus have identified a candidate causative mutation for OI in Dachshunds and identified a fifth OI gene.
1 Evidence of gender bias in True-False-Abstain medical examinations. There is evidence that males and females differ in their attainment on a variety of assessments in general and in medical education. It has been suggested that the True-False-Abstain (TFA) format with negative marking is biased against females. Eight years worth of examination data from the first two years of an undergraduate medical curriculum was analysed. 359 courses were evaluated for statistically significant differences between the genders using ANOVA. Logistic regression was used to test if subject area, calendar year or exam format predicted that males or females do better (termed male advantage or female advantage). Statistically significant differences between the genders were found in 111 (31%) of assessments with females doing better than males in 85 and males better in 26. Female advantage was associated with a particular year (2001), the Personal and Professional Development strand of the curriculum, in course assessment and short answer questions. Male advantage was associated with the anatomy and physiology strand of the curriculum and examinations containing TFA formats, where the largest gender difference was noted. Males were 16.7 times more likely than females to do better on an assessment if it had any questions using the TFA format. Although a range of statistically significant gender differences was found, they were concentrated in TFA and short answer formats. The largest effect was for TFA formats where males were much more likely to do better than females. The gender bias of TFA assessments in medical education is yet another reason why caution should be exercised in their use.
1 Role of N-acetylcysteine in the management of COPD. The importance of the underlying local and systemic oxidative stress and inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has long been established. In view of the lack of therapy that might inhibit the progress of the disease, there is an urgent need for a successful therapeutic approach that, through affecting the pathological processes, will influence the subsequent issues in COPD management such as lung function, airway clearance, dyspnoea, exacerbation, and quality of life. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a mucolytic and antioxidant drug that may also influence several inflammatory pathways. It provides the sulfhydryl groups and acts both as a precursor of reduced glutathione and as a direct reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, hence regulating the redox status in the cells. The changed redox status may, in turn, influence the inflammation-controlling pathways. Moreover, as a mucolytic drug, it may, by means of decreasing viscosity of the sputum, clean the bronchi leading to a decrease in dyspnoea and improved lung function. Nevertheless, as successful as it is in the in vitro studies and in vivo studies with high dosage, its actions at the dosages used in COPD management are debatable. It seems to influence exacerbation rate and limit the number of hospitalization days, however, with little or no influence on the lung function parameters. Despite these considerations and in view of the present lack of effective therapies to inhibit disease progression in COPD, NAC and its derivatives with their multiple molecular modes of action remain promising medication once doses and route of administration are optimized.
1 Accuracy and precision in quantitative fluorescence microscopy. The light microscope has long been used to document the localization of fluorescent molecules in cell biology research. With advances in digital cameras and the discovery and development of genetically encoded fluorophores, there has been a huge increase in the use of fluorescence microscopy to quantify spatial and temporal measurements of fluorescent molecules in biological specimens. Whether simply comparing the relative intensities of two fluorescent specimens, or using advanced techniques like Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), quantitation of fluorescence requires a thorough understanding of the limitations of and proper use of the different components of the imaging system. Here, I focus on the parameters of digital image acquisition that affect the accuracy and precision of quantitative fluorescence microscopy measurements.
3 Security and privacy requirements for a multi-institutional cancer research data grid: an interview-based study. Data protection is important for all information systems that deal with human-subjects data. Grid-based systems--such as the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG)--seek to develop new mechanisms to facilitate real-time federation of cancer-relevant data sources, including sources protected under a variety of regulatory laws, such as HIPAA and 21CFR11. These systems embody new models for data sharing, and hence pose new challenges to the regulatory community, and to those who would develop or adopt them. These challenges must be understood by both systems developers and system adopters. In this paper, we describe our work collecting policy statements, expectations, and requirements from regulatory decision makers at academic cancer centers in the United States. We use these statements to examine fundamental assumptions regarding data sharing using data federations and grid computing. An interview-based study of key stakeholders from a sample of US cancer centers. Interviews were structured, and used an instrument that was developed for the purpose of this study. The instrument included a set of problem scenarios--difficult policy situations that were derived during a full-day discussion of potentially problematic issues by a set of project participants with diverse expertise. Each problem scenario included a set of open-ended questions that were designed to elucidate stakeholder opinions and concerns. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, data was aggregated at the individual or institutional unit of analysis, depending on the specific interview question. Thirty-one (31) individuals at six cancer centers were contacted to participate. Twenty-four out of thirty-one (24/31) individuals responded to our request- yielding a total response rate of 77%. Respondents included IRB directors and policy-makers, privacy and security officers, directors of offices of research, information security officers and university legal counsel. Nineteen total interviews were conducted over a period of 16 weeks. Respondents provided answers for all four scenarios (a total of 87 questions). Results were grouped by broad themes, including among others: governance, legal and financial issues, partnership agreements, de-identification, institutional technical infrastructure for security and privacy protection, training, risk management, auditing, IRB issues, and patient/subject consent. The findings suggest that with additional work, large scale federated sharing of data within a regulated environment is possible. A key challenge is developing suitable models for authentication and authorization practices within a federated environment. Authentication--the recognition and validation of a person's identity--is in fact a global property of such systems, while authorization - the permission to access data or resources--mimics data sharing agreements in being best served at a local level. Nine specific recommendations result from the work and are discussed in detail. These include: (1) the necessity to construct separate legal or corporate entities for governance of federated sharing initiatives on this scale; (2) consensus on the treatment of foreign and commercial partnerships; (3) the development of risk models and risk management processes; (4) development of technical infrastructure to support the credentialing process associated with research including human subjects; (5) exploring the feasibility of developing large-scale, federated honest broker approaches; (6) the development of suitable, federated identity provisioning processes to support federated authentication and authorization; (7) community development of requisite HIPAA and research ethics training modules by federation members; (8) the recognition of the need for central auditing requirements and authority, and; (9) use of two-protocol data exchange models where possible in the federation.
3 Targeted glycoproteomic identification of cancer cell glycosylation. GalMBP is a fragment of serum mannose-binding protein that has been modified to create a probe for galactose-containing ligands. Glycan array screening demonstrated that the carbohydrate-recognition domain of GalMBP selectively binds common groups of tumor-associated glycans, including Lewis-type structures and T antigen, suggesting that engineered glycan-binding proteins such as GalMBP represent novel tools for the characterization of glycoproteins bearing tumor-associated glycans. Blotting of cell extracts and membranes from MCF7 breast cancer cells with radiolabeled GalMBP was used to demonstrate that it binds to a selected set of high molecular weight glycoproteins that could be purified from MCF7 cells on an affinity column constructed with GalMBP. Proteomic and glycomic analysis of these glycoproteins by mass spectrometry showed that they are forms of CD98hc that bear glycans displaying heavily fucosylated termini, including Lewis(x) and Lewis(y) structures. The pool of ligands was found to include the target ligands for anti-CD15 antibodies, which are commonly used to detect Lewis(x) antigen on tumors, and for the endothelial scavenger receptor C-type lectin, which may be involved in tumor metastasis through interactions with this antigen. A survey of additional breast cancer cell lines reveals that there is wide variation in the types of glycosylation that lead to binding of GalMBP. Higher levels of binding are associated either with the presence of outer-arm fucosylated structures carried on a variety of different cell surface glycoproteins or with the presence of high levels of the mucin MUC1 bearing T antigen.
3 A single regulatory gene is sufficient to alter bacterial host range. Microbial symbioses are essential for the normal development and growth of animals. Often, symbionts must be acquired from the environment during each generation, and identification of the relevant symbiotic partner against a myriad of unwanted relationships is a formidable task. Although examples of this specificity are well-documented, the genetic mechanisms governing it are poorly characterized. Here we show that the two-component sensor kinase RscS is necessary and sufficient for conferring efficient colonization of Euprymna scolopes squid by bioluminescent Vibrio fischeri from the North Pacific Ocean. In the squid symbiont V. fischeri ES114, RscS controls light-organ colonization by inducing the Syp exopolysaccharide, a mediator of biofilm formation during initial infection. A genome-level comparison revealed that rscS, although present in squid symbionts, is absent from the fish symbiont V. fischeri MJ11. We found that heterologous expression of RscS in strain MJ11 conferred the ability to colonize E. scolopes in a manner comparable to that of natural squid isolates. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses support an important role for rscS in the evolution of the squid symbiosis. Our results demonstrate that a regulatory gene can alter the host range of animal-associated bacteria. We show that, by encoding a regulator and not an effector that interacts directly with the host, a single gene can contribute to the evolution of host specificity by switching 'on' pre-existing capabilities for interaction with animal tissue.
3 Klassevirus 1, a previously undescribed member of the family Picornaviridae, is globally widespread. Diarrhea is the third leading infectious cause of death worldwide and is estimated to be responsible for approximately 2 million deaths a year. While many infectious causes of diarrhea have been established, approximately 40% of all diarrhea cases are of unknown etiology. In an effort to identify novel viruses that may be causal agents of diarrhea, we used high throughput mass sequencing to analyze stool samples collected from patients with acute diarrhea. Sequences with limited similarity to known picornaviruses were detected in a stool sample collected in Australia from a child with acute diarrhea. Using a combination of mass sequencing, RT-PCR, 5' RACE and 3' RACE, a 6383 bp fragment of the viral genome was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this virus was highly divergent from, but most closely related to, members of the genus Kobuvirus. We have tentatively named this novel virus klassevirus 1. We also detected klassevirus 1 by RT-PCR in a diarrhea specimen collected from a patient in St. Louis, United States as well as in untreated sewage collected in Barcelona, Spain. Klassevirus 1 is a previously undescribed picornavirus that is globally widespread and present on at least three continents. Further investigations to determine whether klassevirus 1 is a human pathogen are needed.
3 Are clinicians being prepared to care for abused women? A survey of health professional education in Ontario, Canada. The current project undertook a province-wide survey and environmental scan of educational opportunities available to future health care providers on the topic of intimate partner violence (IPV) against women. A team of experts identified university and college programs in Ontario, Canada as potential providers of IPV education to students in health care professions at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels. A telephone survey with contacts representing these programs was conducted between October 2005 and March 2006. The survey asked whether IPV-specific education was provided to learners, and if so, how and by whom. In total, 222 eligible programs in dentistry, medicine, nursing and other allied health professions were surveyed, and 95% (212/222) of programs responded. Of these, 57% reported offering some form of IPV-specific education, with undergraduate nursing (83%) and allied health (82%) programs having the highest rates. Fewer than half of undergraduate medical (43%) and dentistry (46%) programs offered IPV content. Postgraduate programs ranged from no IPV content provision (dentistry) to 41% offering content (nursing). Significant variability exists across program areas regarding the methods for IPV education, its delivery and evaluation. The results of this project highlight that expectations for an active and consistent response by health care professionals to women experiencing the effects of violence may not match the realities of professional preparation.
0 Developments in the scientific understanding of osteoporosis. During the past 10 years we have experienced very significant developments in our understanding of bone biology, and this has improved our abilities to both diagnose and treat patients with osteoporosis. This review covers some of the significant discoveries in bone biology that have led to a better understanding of osteoporosis, including a few of the discoveries that have been translated into new therapies to treat patients with osteoporosis and the structural deterioration of patients with inflammatory arthritis.
0 Depression in COPD--management and quality of life considerations. Depression is common in COPD patients. Around 40% are affected by severe depressive symptoms or clinical depression. It is not easy to diagnose depression in COPD patients because of overlapping symptoms between COPD and depression. However, the six-item Hamilton Depression Subscale appears to be a useful screening tool. Quality of life is strongly impaired in COPD patients and patients' quality of life emerges to be more correlated with the presence of depressive symptoms than with the severity of COPD. Nortriptyline and imipramine are effective in the treatment of depression, but little is known about the usefulness of newer antidepressants. In patients with milder depression, pulmonary rehabilitation as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy are effective. Little is known about the long-term outcome in COPD patients with co-morbid depression. Preliminary data suggest that co-morbid depression may be an independent protector for mortality.
1 The impact of rheumatoid foot on disability in Colombian patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Alterations in the feet of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are a cause of disability in this population. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the impact that foot impairment has on the patients' global quality of life (QOL) based on validated scales and its relationship to disease activity. This was a cross-sectional study in which 95 patients with RA were enrolled. A complete physical examination, including a full foot assessment, was done. The Spanish versions of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index and of the Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) were administered. A logistic regression model was used to analyze data and obtain adjusted odds ratios (AORs). Foot deformities were observed in 78 (82%) of the patients; hallux valgus (65%), medial longitudinal arch flattening (42%), claw toe (lesser toes) (39%), dorsiflexion restriction (tibiotalar) (34%), cock-up toe (lesser toes) (25%), and transverse arch flattening (25%) were the most frequent. In the logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age, gender and duration of disease), forefoot movement pain, subtalar movement pain, tibiotalar movement pain and plantarflexion restriction (tibiotalar) were strongly associated with disease activity and disability. The positive squeeze test was significantly associated with disability risk (AOR = 6,3; 95% CI, 1.28-30.96; P = 0,02); hallux valgus, and dorsiflexion restriction (tibiotalar) were associated with disease activity. Foot abnormalities are associated with active joint disease and disability in RA. Foot examinations provide complementary information related to the disability as an indirect measurement of quality of life and activity of disease in daily practice.
3 The recycling and transcytotic pathways for IgG transport by FcRn are distinct and display an inherent polarity. The Fc receptor FcRn traffics immunoglobulin G (IgG) in both directions across polarized epithelial cells that line mucosal surfaces, contributing to host defense. We show that FcRn traffics IgG from either apical or basolateral membranes into the recycling endosome (RE), after which the actin motor myosin Vb and the GTPase Rab25 regulate a sorting step that specifies transcytosis without affecting recycling. Another regulatory component of the RE, Rab11a, is dispensable for transcytosis, but regulates recycling to the basolateral membrane only. None of these proteins affect FcRn trafficking away from lysosomes. Thus, FcRn transcytotic and recycling sorting steps are distinct. These results are consistent with a single structurally and functionally heterogeneous RE compartment that traffics FcRn to both cell surfaces while discriminating between recycling and transcytosis pathways polarized in their direction of transport.
3 Marked differences in CRP genotype frequencies between the Fulani and sympatric ethnic groups in Africa. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein that can activate various immune cells and bind to certain Fcgamma receptors. The latter may compete with the binding of IgG antibodies to these receptors and could thereby interfere with the antigen-specific immune response. Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the CRP gene have been strongly associated with the plasma concentration of CRP. The known lower susceptibility to malaria in the Fulani ethnic group, as compared to their sympatric neighbours in Africa, has been linked to different genetic backgrounds. The present study was performed to investigate if polymorphisms in the CRP gene could contribute to the lower susceptibility to malaria seen in the Fulani ethnic group. The CRP -717 T>C, -286 C>T>A, and +1444 C>T polymorphisms were analysed in asymptomatic Fulani and non-Fulani individuals from Mali and Sudan using Pyrosequencing T and TaqMan r MGB probes. The rare -286 A allele, previously shown to be associated with increased CRP expression and plasma levels, was shown to be more frequent in the non-Fulani ethnic groups as compared to the sympatric Fulani ethnic group both in Mali and Sudan. The common -717 T allele was more prevalent in the non-Fulani ethnic group compared to the sympatric Fulani ethnic group, but only in Mali. The parasite prevalence was increased for the -286 A allele, but not for the -717 T allele. No differences regarding genotype frequency or parasite prevalence were seen for +1444 C>T. This study indicate that CRP may play an important role in the immune responses to malaria, and that the -286 C/T/A CRP polymorphism may be a contributing factor to the lower susceptibility to malaria seen in the Fulani.
3 miRanalyzer: a microRNA detection and analysis tool for next-generation sequencing experiments. Next-generation sequencing allows now the sequencing of small RNA molecules and the estimation of their expression levels. Consequently, there will be a high demand of bioinformatics tools to cope with the several gigabytes of sequence data generated in each single deep-sequencing experiment. Given this scene, we developed miRanalyzer, a web server tool for the analysis of deep-sequencing experiments for small RNAs. The web server tool requires a simple input file containing a list of unique reads and its copy numbers (expression levels). Using these data, miRanalyzer (i) detects all known microRNA sequences annotated in miRBase, (ii) finds all perfect matches against other libraries of transcribed sequences and (iii) predicts new microRNAs. The prediction of new microRNAs is an especially important point as there are many species with very few known microRNAs. Therefore, we implemented a highly accurate machine learning algorithm for the prediction of new microRNAs that reaches AUC values of 97.9% and recall values of up to 75% on unseen data. The web tool summarizes all the described steps in a single output page, which provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis, adding links to more detailed output pages for each analysis module. miRanalyzer is available at http://web.bioinformatics.cicbiogune.es/microRNA/.
3 A trans-membrane segment inside the ribosome exit tunnel triggers RAMP4 recruitment to the Sec61p translocase. Membrane protein integration occurs predominantly at the endoplasmic reticulum and is mediated by the translocon, which is formed by the Sec61p complex. The translocon binds to the ribosome at the polypeptide exit site such that integration occurs in a cotranslational manner. Ribosomal protein Rpl17 is positioned such that it contacts both the ribosome exit tunnel and the surface of the ribosome near the exit site, where it is intimately associated with the translocon. The presence of a trans-membrane (TM) segment inside the ribosomal exit tunnel leads to the recruitment of RAMP4 to the translocon at a site adjacent to Rpl17. This suggests a signaling function for Rpl17 such that it can recognize a TM segment inside the ribosome and triggers rearrangements of the translocon, priming it for subsequent TM segment integration.
2 Identifying strategies to maximise recruitment and retention of practices and patients in a multicentre randomised controlled trial of an intervention to optimise secondary prevention for coronary heart disease in primary care. Recruitment and retention of patients and healthcare providers in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is important in order to determine the effectiveness of interventions. However, failure to achieve recruitment targets is common and reasons why a particular recruitment strategy works for one study and not another remain unclear. We sought to describe a strategy used in a multicentre RCT in primary care, to report researchers' and participants' experiences of its implementation and to inform future strategies to maximise recruitment and retention. In total 48 general practices and 903 patients were recruited from three different areas of Ireland to a RCT of an intervention designed to optimise secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. The recruitment process involved telephoning practices, posting information, visiting practices, identifying potential participants, posting invitations and obtaining consent. Retention involved patients attending reviews and responding to questionnaires and practices facilitating data collection. We achieved high retention rates for practices (100%) and for patients (85%) over an 18-month intervention period. Pilot work, knowledge of the setting, awareness of change in staff and organisation amongst participant sites, rapid responses to queries and acknowledgement of practitioners' contributions were identified as being important. Minor variations in protocol and research support helped to meet varied, complex and changing individual needs of practitioners and patients and encouraged retention in the trial. A collaborative relationship between researcher and practice staff which required time to develop was perceived as vital for both recruitment and retention. Recruiting and retaining the numbers of practices and patients estimated as required to provide findings with adequate power contributes to increased confidence in the validity and generalisability of RCT results. A continuous dynamic process of monitoring progress within trials and tailoring strategies to particular circumstances, whilst not compromising trial protocols, should allow maximal recruitment and retention.

3 Comparative study on the effect of human BST-2/Tetherin on HIV-1 release in cells of various species. In this study, we first demonstrate that endogenous hBST-2 is predominantly expressed on the plasma membrane of a human T cell line, MT-4 cells, and that Vpu-deficient HIV-1 was less efficiently released than wild-type HIV-1 from MT-4 cells. In addition, surface hBST-2 was rapidly down-regulated in wild-type but not Vpu-deficient HIV-1-infected cells. This is a direct insight showing that provirus-encoded Vpu has the potential to down-regulate endogenous hBST-2 from the surface of HIV-1-infected T cells. Corresponding to previous reports, the aforementioned findings suggested that hBST-2 has the potential to suppress the release of Vpu-deficient HIV-1. However, the molecular mechanism(s) for tethering HIV-1 particles by hBST-2 remains unclear, and we speculated about the requirement for cellular co-factor(s) to trigger or assist its tethering ability. To explore this possibility, we utilize several cell lines derived from various species including human, AGM, dog, cat, rabbit, pig, mink, potoroo, and quail. We found that ectopic hBST-2 was efficiently expressed on the surface of all analyzed cells, and its expression suppressed the release of viral particles in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that hBST-2 can tether HIV-1 particles without the need of additional co-factor(s) that may be expressed exclusively in primates, and thus, hBST-2 can also exert its function in many cells derived from a broad range of species. Interestingly, the suppressive effect of hBST-2 on HIV-1 release in Vero cells was much less pronounced than in the other examined cells despite the augmented surface expression of ectopic hBST-2 on Vero cells. Taken together, our findings suggest the existence of certain cell types in which hBST-2 cannot efficiently exert its inhibitory effect on virus release. The cell type-specific effect of hBST-2 may be critical to elucidate the mechanism of BST-2-dependent suppression of virus release.
3 Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of the Acetylcystein for Contrast-Induced nephropaThy (ACT) Trial: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy. Aceltylcysteine has been evaluated in several small trials as a means of reducing the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), however systematic reviews of these studies do not provide conclusive answers. Therefore, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to provide a reliable answer as to whether acetylcysteine is effective in decreasing the risk of CIN in high-risk patients undergoing angiographic procedures. ACT is a RCT of acetylcysteine versus placebo in 2,300 patients at-risk for CIN undergoing an intravascular angiographic procedure. The randomization list will be concealed. Participants, health care staff, investigators and outcome assessors will be blinded to whether patients receive acetylcysteine or placebo. All analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. The study drugs (acetylcysteine 1200 mg or placebo) will be administered orally twice daily for two doses before and two doses after the procedure. The primary outcome is the occurrence of CIN, defined as a 25% elevation of serum creatinine above baseline between 48 and 96 hours after angiography. The first patient entered the trial on September, 2008. Up to April 7, 2009, 810 patients had been included in 35 centers. The mean age was 69 (Standard deviation: 10), 18% had a baseline serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, 57% were diabetics and 13% had a history of heart failure. The ongoing ACT Trial is the largest multicentre RCT that will determine whether acetylcysteine is effective in decreasing the risk of CIN in patients at risk undergoing angiography.

2 Effects of recombinant LH supplementation to recombinant FSH during induced ovarian stimulation in the GnRH-agonist protocol: a matched case-control study. Some studies have suggested that the suppression of endogenous LH secretion does not seem to affect the majority of patients who are undergoing assisted reproduction and stimulation with recombinant FSH (r-FSH). Other studies have indicated that a group of normogonadotrophic women down-regulated and stimulated with pure FSH preparations may experience low LH concentrations that compromise the IVF parameters. The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of recombinant LH (r-LH) supplementation for controlled ovarian stimulation in r-FSH and GnRH-agonist (GnRH-a) protocol in ICSI cycles. A total of 244 patients without ovulatory dysfunction, aged <40 years and at the first ICSI cycle were divided into two groups matched by age according to an ovarian stimulation scheme: Group I (n = 122): Down-regulation with GnRH-a + r-FSH and Group II (n = 122): Down-regulation with GnRH-a + r-FSH and r-LH (beginning simultaneously). The number of oocytes collected, the number of oocytes in metaphase II and fertilization rate were significantly lower in the Group I than in Group II (P = 0.036, P = 0.0014 and P = 0.017, respectively). In addition, the mean number of embryos produced per cycle and the mean number of frozen embryos per cycle were statistically lower (P = 0.0092 and P = 0.0008, respectively) in Group I than in Group II. Finally the cumulative implantation rate (fresh+thaw ed embryos) was significantly lower (P = 0.04) in Group I than in Group II. The other clinical and laboratory results analyzed did not show difference between groups. These data support r-LH supplementation in ovarian stimulation protocols with r-FSH and GnRH-a for assisted reproduction treatment.
1 Effect of methotrexate and anti-TNF on Epstein-Barr virus T-cell response and viral load in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or spondylarthropathies. There is a suspicion of increased risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferations in patients with inflammatory arthritides receiving immunosuppressive drugs. We investigated the EBV load and EBV-specific T-cell response in patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) or anti-TNF therapy. Data for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 58) or spondylarthropathy (SpA) (n = 28) were analyzed at baseline in comparison with controls (n = 22) and after 3 months of MTX or anti-TNF therapy for EBV load and EBV-specific IFNgamma-producing T cells in response to EBV latent-cycle and lytic-cycle peptides. The EBV load and the number of IFNgamma-producing T-cells after peptide stimulation were not significantly different between groups at baseline (P = 0.61 and P = 0.89, respectively). The EBV load was not significantly modified by treatment, for RA with MTX (P = 0.74) or anti-TNF therapy (P = 0.94) or for SpA with anti-TNF therapy (P = 1.00). The number of EBV-specific T cells was not significantly modified by treatment, for RA with MTX (P = 0.58) or anti-TNF drugs (P = 0.19) or for SpA with anti-TNF therapy (P = 0.39). For all patients, the EBV load and EBV-specific T cells were significantly correlated (P = 0.017; R = 0.21). For most patients, short-term exposure (3 months) to MTX or anti-TNF did not alter the EBV load or EBV-specific T-cell response but two patients had discordant evolution. These data are reassuring and suggest there is no short-term defect in EBV-immune surveillance in patients receiving MTX or anti-TNF drugs. However, in these patients, long term follow-up of EBV-specific T-cell response is necessary and the role of non-EBV-related mechanisms of lymphomagenesis is not excluded.
0 Induction of thyroid gene expression and radioiodine uptake in melanoma cells: novel therapeutic implications. Both the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways play an important role in the pathogenesis of melanoma. We conducted the present study to test the hypothesis that targeting the two pathways to potently induce cell inhibition accompanied with thyroid iodide-handling gene expression for adjunct radioiodine ablation could be a novel effective therapeutic strategy for melanoma. We used specific shRNA approaches and inhibitors to individually or dually suppress the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways and examined the effects on a variety of molecular and cellular responses of melanoma cells that harbored activating genetic alterations in the two pathways. Suppression of the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways showed potent anti-melanoma cell effects, including the inhibition of cell proliferation, transformation and invasion, induction of G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and, when the two pathways were dually suppressed, cell apoptosis. Remarkably, suppression of the two pathways, particularly simultaneous suppression of them, also induced expression of genes that are normally expressed in the thyroid gland, such as the genes for sodium/iodide symporter and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor. Melanoma cells were consequently conferred the ability to take up radioiodide. We conclude that dually targeting the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways for potent cell inhibition coupled with induction of thyroid gene expression for adjunct radioiodine ablation therapy may prove to be a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for melanoma.
0 The severity and status of eating disorder NOS: implications for DSM-V. "Eating disorder NOS" is the most common eating disorder encountered in outpatient settings yet it has been neglected. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of eating disorder NOS, establish its severity, and determine whether its high relative prevalence might be due to the inclusion of cases closely resembling anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. One hundred and seventy consecutive patients with an eating disorder were assessed using standardised instruments. Operational DSM-IV diagnoses were made and eating disorder NOS cases were compared with bulimia nervosa cases. Diagnostic criteria were then adjusted to determine the impact on the prevalence of eating disorder NOS. Cases of eating disorder NOS comprised 60.0% of the sample. These cases closely resembled the cases of bulimia nervosa in the nature, duration and severity of their psychopathology. Few could be reclassified as cases of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. The findings indicate that eating disorder NOS is common, severe and persistent. Most cases are "mixed" in character and not subthreshold forms of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. It is proposed that in DSM-V the clinical state (or states) currently embraced by the diagnosis eating disorder NOS be reclassified as one or more specific forms of eating disorder.
0 PLK1 down-regulates parainfluenza virus 5 gene expression. The paramyxoviruses are a family of negative-sense RNA viruses that includes many important human and animal pathogens. Paramyxovirus RNA synthesis requires the viral phosphoprotein (P) and the large (L) protein. Phosphorylation of P is thought to regulate viral gene expression, though direct proof remains elusive. Recently, we reported that phosphorylation of a specific residue (Ser157) of the P protein of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a prototypical paramyxovirus, correlates with decreased viral gene expression and cytokine expression in infected cells. Here, we show that: Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a serine/theronine kinase that plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle, interacts with PIV5 P through the S157 residue; PLK1 inhibition increases viral gene expression; PLK1 over-expression inhibits viral gene expression; and PLK1 directly phosphorylates P in vitro, indicating that PLK1 down-regulates viral gene expression by phosphorylating P. Furthermore, we have determined the PLK1 phosphorylation site on P and found that mutant recombinant PIV5 whose P proteins cannot either bind to or be phosphorylated by PLK1 have similar phenotypes. Increased viral gene expression in PIV5 with mutations in the PLK1 binding/phosphorylation sites correlates with increased induction of cell death and cytokine expression, suggesting that PIV5 limits its viral gene expression to avoid these host effects. It is possible that targeting PLK1 will enhance host innate immune responses, leading to a novel strategy of clearing paramyxovirus infections quickly.
3 Thyroid hormone levels of pregnant inuit women and their infants exposed to environmental contaminants. An increasing number of studies have shown that several ubiquitous environmental contaminants possess thyroid hormone-disrupting capacities. Prenatal exposure to some of them, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), has also been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in infants. In this study we examined the relationship between exposure to potential thyroid hormone-disrupting toxicants and thyroid hormone status in pregnant Inuit women from Nunavik and their infants within the first year of life. We measured thyroid hormone parameters [thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT(4)), total triiodothyronine (T(3)), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)] and concentrations of several contaminants [PCB-153, hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs (HO-PCBs), pentachlorophenol (PCP) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB)] in maternal plasma at delivery (n = 120), in umbilical cord plasma (n = 95), and in infant plasma at 7 months postpartum (n = 130). In pregnant women, we found a positive association between HO-PCBs and T(3) concentrations (beta = 0.57, p = 0.02). In umbilical cord blood, PCB-153 concentrations were negatively associated with TBG levels (beta = -0.26, p = 0.01). In a subsample analysis, a negative relationship was also found between maternal PCP levels and cord fT(4) concentrations in neonates (beta = -0.59, p = 0.02). No association was observed between contaminants and thyroid hormones at 7 months of age. Overall, there is little evidence that the environmental contaminants analyzed in this study affect thyroid hormone status in Inuit mothers and their infants. The possibility that PCP may decrease thyroxine levels in neonates requires further investigation.
1 NLStradamus: a simple Hidden Markov Model for nuclear localization signal prediction. Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are stretches of residues within a protein that are important for the regulated nuclear import of the protein. Of the many import pathways that exist in yeast, the best characterized is termed the 'classical' NLS pathway. The classical NLS contains specific patterns of basic residues and computational methods have been designed to predict the location of these motifs on proteins. The consensus sequences, or patterns, for the other import pathways are less well-understood. In this paper, we present an analysis of characterized NLSs in yeast, and find, despite the large number of nuclear import pathways, that NLSs seem to show similar patterns of amino acid residues. We test current prediction methods and observe a low true positive rate. We therefore suggest an approach using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to predict novel NLSs in proteins. We show that our method is able to consistently find 37% of the NLSs with a low false positive rate and that our method retains its true positive rate outside of the yeast data set used for the training parameters. Our implementation of this model, NLStradamus, is made available at: (http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/NLStradamus/).
1 Suspected malignant cord compression - improving time to diagnosis via a 'hotline': a prospective audit. The aim of the study was to achieve earlier diagnosis of malignant cord compression (MCC) using urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for selected patients. A comparison was carried out of the current prospective audit of 100 patients referred by a general practitioner or a consultant over 32 months with both a previous national Clinical Research and Audit Group (CRAG) prospective audit (324 cases of MCC) and an earlier retrospective audit of 104 patients referred with suspected MCC. A telephone hotline rapid-referral process for patients with known malignancy and new symptoms (severe nerve root pain +/- severe back pain) was designed. Patients were considered for urgent MRI after discussion with a senior clinician responsible for the hotline. Appropriate referrals were discussed with radiology and oncology ensuring timely MRI reporting and intervention. The main outcome measures are as follows: time from referral to diagnosis; time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis; and mobility at diagnosis. A total of 50 patients (52%) of those scanned had either MCC (44) or malignant nerve root compression (6) compared with the earlier rate of 23 out of 104 patients (22%). Ten out of 44 MCC patients (23%) were paralysed at diagnosis, compared with 149 out of 324 (46%) in the CRAG audit. Time from reporting pain to diagnosis was 32 days compared with 89 days in the CRAG audit. Median time from referral to diagnosis was 1 day, again considerably shorter than the CRAG audit time of 15 days (interquartile (IQ) range: 3-66). In patients at risk of MCC, fast-track referral with rapid access to MRI reduces time between symptom onset and diagnosis, improves mobility at diagnosis and reduces the number of negative MRI scans.
0 Death-associated protein 3 is overexpressed in human thyroid oncocytic tumours. The human death-associated protein 3 (hDAP3) is a GTP-binding constituent of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome with a pro-apoptotic function. A search through publicly available microarray data sets showed 337 genes potentially coregulated with the DAP3 gene. The promoter sequences of these 337 genes and 70 out of 85 mitochondrial ribosome genes were analysed in silico with the DAP3 gene promoter sequence. The mitochondrial role of DAP3 was also investigated in the thyroid tumours presenting various mitochondrial contents. The study revealed nine transcription factors presenting enriched motifs for these gene promoters, five of which are implicated in cellular growth (ELK1, ELK4, RUNX1, HOX11-CTF1, TAL1-ternary complex factor 3) and four in mitochondrial biogenesis (nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), GABPA, PPARG-RXRA and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA)). An independent microarray data set showed the overexpression of ELK1, RUNX1 and ESRRA in the thyroid oncocytic tumours. Exploring the thyroid tumours, we found that DAP3 mRNA and protein expression is upregulated in tumours presenting a mitochondrial biogenesis compared with the normal tissue. ELK1 and ESRRA were also showed upregulated with DAP3. ELK1 and ESRRA may be considered as potential regulators of the DAP3 gene expression. DAP3 may participate in mitochondrial maintenance and play a role in the balance between mitochondrial homoeostasis and tumourigenesis.
3 Hepatitis C virus core, NS3, NS4B and NS5A are the major immunogenic proteins in humoral immunity in chronic HCV infection. The viral genome of hepatitis C virus constitutes a 9.6-kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA which encodes altogether 11 viral proteins. In order to study the humoral immune responses against different HCV proteins in patients suffering from chronic HCV infection, we produced three structural (core, E1 and E2) and six nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) in Sf9 insect cells by using the baculovirus expression system. The recombinant HCV core, E1, E2, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B proteins were purified and used in Western blot analysis to determine antibody responses against individual HCV protein in 68 HCV RNA and antibody positive human sera that were obtained from patients suffering from genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 infection. These sera were also analysed with INNO-LIA Score test for HCV antibodies against core, NS3, NS4AB and NS5A, and the results were similar to the ones obtained by Western blot method. Based on our Western blot analyses we found that the major immunogenic HCV antigens were the core, NS4B, NS3 and NS5A proteins which were recognized in 97%, 86%, 68% and 53% of patient sera, respectively. There were no major genotype specific differences in antibody responses to individual HCV proteins. A common feature within the studied sera was that all except two sera recognized the core protein in high titers, whereas none of the sera recognized NS2 protein and only three sera (from genotype 3) recognised NS5B. The data shows significant variation in the specificity in humoral immunity in chronic HCV patients.
0 The SPX domain of the yeast low-affinity phosphate transporter Pho90 regulates transport activity. Yeast has two phosphate-uptake systems that complement each other: the high-affinity transporters (Pho84 and Pho89) are active under phosphate starvation, whereas Pho87 and Pho90 are low-affinity transporters that function when phosphate is abundant. Here, we report new regulatory functions of the amino-terminal SPX domain of Pho87 and Pho90. By studying truncated versions of Pho87 and Pho90, we show that the SPX domain limits the phosphate-uptake velocity, suppresses phosphate efflux and affects the regulation of the phosphate signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, split-ubiquitin assays and co-immunoprecipitation suggest that the SPX domain of both Pho90 and Pho87 interacts physically with the regulatory protein Spl2. This work suggests that the SPX domain inhibits low-affinity phosphate transport through a physical interaction with Spl2.
1 UHRF1 is a novel molecular marker for diagnosis and the prognosis of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is the second most common cancer of the urinary system. Early diagnosis of this tumour and estimation of risk of future progression after initial transuretherial resection have a significant impact on prognosis. Although there are several molecular markers for the diagnosis and prognosis for this tumour, their accuracy is not ideal. Previous reports have shown that UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring-finger domains 1) is essential for cellular proliferation. In this study, we examined whether UHRF1 can be a novel molecular marker of bladder cancer. We performed real-time TaqMan quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry to examine expression levels of UHRF1 in bladder and kidney cancers. Significant overexpression of UHRF1 was observed in bladder cancer. The overexpression was correlated with the stage and grade of the cancer. Although UHRF1 expression in muscle-invasive cancer was greater than in non-invasive (pTa) or superficially invasive (pT1) cancers, UHRF1 could still be detected by immunohistochemistry in these early-stage cancers. Overexpression of UHRF1 in bladder cancer was associated with increased risk of progression after transurethral resection. High expression of UHRF1 in kidney cancer was also observed. But the increased levels of UHRF1 in kidney cancer were less significant compared with those in bladder cancer. Our result indicates that an immunohistochemistry-based UHRF1 detection in urine sediment or surgical specimens can be a sensitive and cancer-specific diagnostic and/or prognosis method, and may greatly improve the current diagnosis based on cytology.
0 Diabetic retinopathy, visual impairment and ocular status among patients with diabetes mellitus in Yemen: a hospital-based study. We present a series of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) who attended an eye hospital in Sana, Yemen during 2004. To determine the magnitude and risk factors of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Cross-sectional study. Ophthalmologists assessed vision, ocular pressure, ocular media and posterior segment to note ocular manifestations among patients with DM. DR was graded by using bio-microscope and Volk lens. The prevalence and 95% confidence interval of ocular complications of DM were calculated. Risk factors of DR like age, sex, duration of diabetes and hypertension were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analysis. Our series comprised 350 patients suffering from DM. The duration of diabetes was > or =15 years in 101 (29%) patients. Physician was treating 108 DM patients with insulin. The prevalence of DR was 55% (95% CI 49.6-60.1). The proportions of background diabetic retinopathy (BDR), preproliferative diabetic retinopathy (PPDR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema were 20%, 13%, 17% and 22% respectively. The prevalence of blindness among DM patients was 16%. The prevalence of cataract and glaucoma was 34.3% and 8.6%. Duration of DM was the predictor of DR. One-fifth of the patients had sight-threatening DR and needed laser treatment. DR was of public health magnitude among our patients. An organized approach is recommended to address DR in the study area.
0 A common conformationally coupled ATPase mechanism for yeast and human cytoplasmic HSP90s. The conformationally coupled mechanism by which ATP is utilized by yeast Hsp90 is now well characterized. In contrast, ATP utilization by human Hsp90s is less well studied, and appears to operate differently. To resolve these conflicting models, we have conducted a side-by-side biochemical analysis in a series of mutant yeast and human Hsp90s that have been both mechanistically and structurally characterized with regard to the crystal structure of the yeast Hsp90 protein. We show that each monomer of the human Hsp90 dimer is mutually dependent on the other for ATPase activity. Fluorescence studies confirmed that the N-terminal domains of Hsp90beta come into close association with each other. Mutations that directly affect the conformational dynamics of the ATP-lid segment had marked effects, with T31I (yeast T22I) and A116N (yeast A107N) stimulating, and T110I (yeast T101I) inhibiting, human and yeast ATPase activity to similar extents, showing that ATP-dependent lid closure is a key rate-determining step in both systems. Mutation of residues implicated in N-terminal dimerization of yeast Hsp90 (L15R and L18R in yeast, L24R and L27R in humans) significantly reduced the ATPase activity of yeast and human Hsp90s, showing that ATP-dependent association of the N-terminal domains in the Hsp90 dimer is also essential in both systems. Furthermore, cross-linking studies of the hyper-active yeast A107N and human A116N ATP-lid mutants showed enhanced dimerization, suggesting that N-terminal association is a direct consequence of ATP binding and lid closure in both systems.
3 Broad-spectrum antimicrobial epiphytic and endophytic fungi from marine organisms: isolation, bioassay and taxonomy. In the search for new marine derived antibiotics, 43 epi- and endophytic fungal strains were isolated from the surface or the inner tissue of different marine plants and invertebrates. Through preliminary and secondary screening, 10 of them were found to be able to produce broad-spectrum antimicrobial metabolites. By morphological and molecular biological methods, three active strains were characterized to be Penicillium glabrum, Fusarium oxysporum, and Alternaria alternata.
0 Stepwise evolution of two giant composite LTR-retrotransposon-like elements DA and Xiao. We recently discovered two composite long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposon-like elements which we named DA (approximately 300 kb) and Xiao (approximately 30 kb), meaning big and small in Chinese respectively. Xiao and DA (three types of DA identified) were found to have been derived from several donor sites and have spread to 30 loci in the human genome, totaling to 5 Mb. Our bioinformatics analyses with the released human, chimp, rhesus macaque, orangutan, and marmoset genomic sequences indicate that DA and Xiao emerged approximately 25 million years (Myr) ago. To better understand the evolution of these two complex elements, we investigated various internal junctions of DA and Xiao as well as orthologous genomic sites of the 30 DA/Xiao loci in non-human primates including great apes, lesser apes, Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and a prosimian. We found that Xiao and type I DA first emerged in the genome between 25 and 18 Myr ago, whereas type II and Type III DAs emerged between 14 and 7 Myr ago. Xiao and DA were most active in great apes, with their amplification peaking during 25-14 and 14-7 Myr ago, respectively. Neither DA nor Xiao seem to have been active in the human and chimp genomes during last 6 Myr. The study has led to a more accurate age determination of the DA and Xiao elements than our previous bioinformatics analyses, and indicates that the amplification activity of the elements coincided with that of group I HERV-Es during evolution. It has also illustrated an evolutionary path with stepwise structural changes for the elements during past 25 Myr, and in doing so has shed more light on these two intriguing and complex elements that have reshaped our genome.
0 Cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks after low-dose gamma-irradiation. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a serious threat to genome stability and cell viability. Although biological effects of low levels of radiation are not clear, the risks of low-dose radiation are of societal importance. Here, we directly monitored induction and repair of single DSBs and quantitatively analyzed the dynamics of interaction of DNA repair proteins at individual DSB sites in living cells using 53BP1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP-53BP1) as a surrogate marker. The number of DSBs formed was linear with dose from 5 mGy to 1 Gy. The DSBs induced by very low radiation doses (5 mGy) were repaired with efficiency similar to repair of DSBs induced at higher doses. The YFP-53BP1 foci are dynamic structures: 53BP1 rapidly and reversibly interacted at these DSB sites. The time frame of recruitment and affinity of 53BP1 for DSB sites were indistinguishable between low and high doses, providing mechanistic evidence for the similar DSB repair after low- and high-dose radiation. These findings have important implications for estimating the risk associated with low-dose radiation exposure on human health.
3 Prognosis and predictive value of KIT exon 11 deletion in GISTs. KIT exon 11 mutations are observed in 60% of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). Exon 11 codes for residues Tyr568 and Tyr570, which play a major role in signal transduction and degradation of KIT. Our aim was to compare the outcome of patients with deletion of both Tyr568-570 (delTyr) and the most frequent deletion delWK557-558 (delWK). Pathology and clinical characteristics of 68 patients with delTyr (n=26) or delWK (n=42) were reviewed and compared. GISTs with delTyr were more frequently extragastric than those with delWK (69 vs 26%, P<0.0005). After curative surgery, median relapse-free survival were 10.8 and 11.1 months for patients with delTyr (n=14) and delWK (n=29), respectively (P=0.92). All patients treated with imatinib for a non-resectable or metastatic GIST had an objective response (n=15) or a stable disease (n=21) as best response, regardless of mutation. Median progression-free survival with imatinib were 21.9 and 18.9 months for patients with GIST with delTyr (n=14) and delWK (n=22), respectively (P=0.43). In this large retrospective series, the type of KIT exon 11 mutation was correlated with the origin of GIST, but not with prognosis or response to imatinib.
0 Structural insights into CUG repeats containing the 'stretched U-U wobble': implications for myotonic dystrophy. Tracks containing CUG repeats are abundant in human gene transcripts. Their biological role includes modulation of pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA transport and regulation of translation. Expanded forms of CUG runs are associated with pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including myotonic dystrophy type 1. We have analysed two crystal structures of RNA duplexes containing the CUG repeats: G(CUG)(2)C and (CUG)(6). The first of the structures, analysed at 1.23 A resolution, is of an oligomer designed by us. The second model was obtained after 'detwinning' the 1.58 A X-ray data previously deposited in the PDB. The RNA duplexes are in the A-form in which all the C-G pairs form Watson-Crick interactions while all the uridine pairs can be described as U*U cis wobble having only one hydrogen bond between the bases. The residue, which accepts the H-bond, is inclined towards the minor groove. This previously unreported base pairing can be described as 'stretched U-U wobble'. The regular hydrogen-bonding pattern of interactions with the solvent, the electrostatic charge distribution and surface features indicate the ligand binding potential of the CUG tracks.
0 Contemporary parallel diversification, antipredator adaptations and phenotypic integration in an aquatic isopod. It is increasingly being recognized that predation can be a strong diversifying agent promoting ecological divergence. Adaptations against different predatory regimes can emerge over short periods of time and include many different traits. We studied antipredator adaptations in two ecotypes of an isopod (Asellus aquaticus) that have, diverged in parallel in two Swedish lakes over the last two decades. We quantified differences in escape speed, morphology and behavior for isopods from different ecotypes present in these lakes. Isopods from the source habitat (reed) coexist with mainly invertebrate predators. They are more stream-profiled and have higher escape speeds than isopods in the newly colonized stonewort habitat, which has higher density of fish predators. Stonewort isopods also show more cautious behaviors and had higher levels of phenotypic integration between coloration and morphological traits than the reed isopods. Colonization of a novel habitat with a different predation regime has thus strengthened the correlations between pigmentation and morphology and weakened escape performance. The strong signature of parallelism for these phenotypic traits indicates that divergence is likely to be adaptive and is likely to have been driven by differences in predatory regimes. Furthermore, our results indicate that physical performance, behavior and morphology can change rapidly and in concert as new habitats are colonized.
3 Calyx and dimorphic neurons of mouse Scarpa's ganglion express histamine H3 receptors. Histamine-related drugs are commonly used in the treatment of vertigo and related vestibular disorders. The site of action of these drugs however has not been elucidated yet. Recent works on amphibians showed that histamine H3 receptor antagonists, e.g. betahistine, inhibit the afferent discharge recorded from the vestibular nerve. To assess the expression of H3 histamine receptors in vestibular neurons, we performed mRNA RT-PCR and immunofluorescence experiments in mouse Scarpa's ganglia. RT-PCR analysis showed the presence of H3 receptor mRNA in mouse ganglia tissue. H3 protein expression was found in vestibular neurons characterized by large and roundish soma, which labeled for calretinin and calbindin. The present results are consistent with calyx and dimorphic, but not bouton, afferent vestibular neurons expressing H3 receptors. This study provides a molecular substrate for the effects of histamine-related antivertigo drugs acting on (or binding to) H3 receptors, and suggest a potential target for the treatment of vestibular disorders of peripheral origin.
1 The resting human brain and motor learning. Functionally related brain networks are engaged even in the absence of an overt behavior. The role of this resting state activity, evident as low-frequency fluctuations of BOLD (see [1] for review, [2-4]) or electrical [5, 6] signals, is unclear. Two major proposals are that resting state activity supports introspective thought or supports responses to future events [7]. An alternative perspective is that the resting brain actively and selectively processes previous experiences [8]. Here we show that motor learning can modulate subsequent activity within resting networks. BOLD signal was recorded during rest periods before and after an 11 min visuomotor training session. Motor learning but not motor performance modulated a fronto-parietal resting state network (RSN). Along with the fronto-parietal network, a cerebellar network not previously reported as an RSN was also specifically altered by learning. Both of these networks are engaged during learning of similar visuomotor tasks [9-22]. Thus, we provide the first description of the modulation of specific RSNs by prior learning--but not by prior performance--revealing a novel connection between the neuroplastic mechanisms of learning and resting state activity. Our approach may provide a powerful tool for exploration of the systems involved in memory consolidation.
2 A new procedure for treating a sebaceous cyst: removal of the cyst content with a laser punch and the cyst wall with a minimal postponed excision. Three main techniques are used to excise sebaceous cysts: conventional wide excision, minimal excision, and punch biopsy excision. A new method with two steps is proposed. First, a laser is used to make a small hole for removal of the content. Then the cyst wall is removed entirely with a minimal excision about 1 month later. With this method, the cyst is completely removed with only a small scar. It offers a good alternative for eradication of uninfected cysts, especially large cysts or cysts located in areas of thick skin or cosmetic concern.
0 Psychiatric and psychosocial problems in adults with normal-intelligence autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) often display symptoms from other diagnostic categories. Studies of clinical and psychosocial outcome in adult patients with ASDs without concomitant intellectual disability are few. The objective of this paper is to describe the clinical psychiatric presentation and important outcome measures of a large group of normal-intelligence adult patients with ASDs. Autistic symptomatology according to the DSM-IV-criteria and the Gillberg & Gillberg research criteria, patterns of comorbid psychopathology and psychosocial outcome were assessed in 122 consecutively referred adults with normal intelligence ASDs. The subjects consisted of 5 patients with autistic disorder (AD), 67 with Asperger's disorder (AS) and 50 with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD NOS). This study group consists of subjects pooled from two studies with highly similar protocols, all seen on an outpatient basis by one of three clinicians. Core autistic symptoms were highly prevalent in all ASD subgroups. Though AD subjects had the most pervasive problems, restrictions in non-verbal communication were common across all three subgroups and, contrary to current DSM criteria, so were verbal communication deficits. Lifetime psychiatric axis I comorbidity was very common, most notably mood and anxiety disorders, but also ADHD and psychotic disorders. The frequency of these diagnoses did not differ between the ASD subgroups or between males and females. Antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse were more common in the PDD NOS group. Of all subjects, few led an independent life and very few had ever had a long-term relationship. Female subjects more often reported having been bullied at school than male subjects. ASDs are clinical syndromes characterized by impaired social interaction and non-verbal communication in adulthood as well as in childhood. They also carry a high risk for co-existing mental health problems from a broad spectrum of disorders and for unfavourable psychosocial life circumstances. For the next revision of DSM, our findings especially stress the importance of careful examination of the exclusion criterion for adult patients with ASDs.
2 Off-label use of medicines in children: can available evidence avoid useless paediatric trials? The case of proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. In some cases of drug therapy, the available evidence might be sufficient to extend the indications to children without further clinical studies. We reviewed the available evidence for one of the categories of drugs most frequently used off-label in children: proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A classification of the appropriateness of off-label use of PPIs in children with GERD was also performed. Of the five PPIs evaluated, only omeprazole has a paediatric indication in Europe. Overall, 19 clinical trials were retrieved and evaluated on the basis of pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety data. The off-label use of omeprazole, esomeprazole and lansoprazole in children was evaluated as appropriate given the consistent available evidence retrieved in literature. This study demonstrates the existence of a large body of clinical evidence on the use of PPIs in children. Regulatory agencies and ethical committees should cope with this issue for ethical reasons to avoid unnecessary trial replication.
2 Cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone induction for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: high response rates in a phase II clinical trial. We have studied a three-drug combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) on a 28-day cycle in the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients to assess response and toxicity. The primary endpoint of response was evaluated after four cycles. Thirty-three newly diagnosed, symptomatic patients with MM received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 4, 8 and 11, cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m(2) orally on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 and dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days 1-4, 9-12 and 17-20 on a 28-day cycle for four cycles. Responses were rapid with a mean 80% decline in the sentinel monoclonal protein at the end of two cycles. The overall intent to treat response rate (>or= partial response) was 88%, with 61% of very good partial response or better (>or=VGPR) and 39% of complete/near complete response (CR/nCR). For the 28 patients who completed all four cycles of therapy, the CR/nCR rate was 46% and VGPR rate was 71%. All patients undergoing stem cell harvest had a successful collection. Twenty-three patients underwent stem cell transplantation (SCT) and are evaluable through day 100 with CR/nCR documented in 70% and >or=VGPR in 74%. In conclusion, CyBorD produces a rapid and profound response in patients with newly diagnosed MM with manageable toxicity.
0 Relativity theory and time perception: single or multiple clocks? Current theories of interval timing assume that humans and other animals time as if using a single, absolute stopwatch that can be stopped or reset on command. Here we evaluate the alternative view that psychological time is represented by multiple clocks, and that these clocks create separate temporal contexts by which duration is judged in a relative manner. Two predictions of the multiple-clock hypothesis were tested. First, that the multiple clocks can be manipulated (stopped and/or reset) independently. Second, that an event of a given physical duration would be perceived as having different durations in different temporal contexts, i.e., would be judged differently by each clock. Rats were trained to time three durations (e.g., 10, 30, and 90 s). When timing was interrupted by an unexpected gap in the signal, rats reset the clock used to time the "short" duration, stopped the "medium" duration clock, and continued to run the "long" duration clock. When the duration of the gap was manipulated, the rats reset these clocks in a hierarchical order, first the "short", then the "medium", and finally the "long" clock. Quantitative modeling assuming re-allocation of cognitive resources in proportion to the relative duration of the gap to the multiple, simultaneously timed event durations was used to account for the results. These results indicate that the three event durations were effectively timed by separate clocks operated independently, and that the same gap duration was judged relative to these three temporal contexts. Results suggest that the brain processes the duration of an event in a manner similar to Einstein's special relativity theory: A given time interval is registered differently by independent clocks dependent upon the context.
2 Methods for economic evaluation of a factorial-design cluster randomised controlled trial of a nutrition supplement and an exercise programme among healthy older people living in Santiago, Chile: the CENEX study. In an effort to promote healthy ageing and preserve health and function, the government of Chile has formulated a package of actions into the Programme for Complementary Food in Older People (Programa de Alimentación Complementaria para el Adulto Mayor - PACAM). The CENEX study was designed to evaluate the impact, cost and cost-effectiveness of the PACAM and a specially designed exercise programme on pneumonia incidence, walking capacity and body mass index in healthy older people living in low- to medium-socio-economic status areas of Santiago. The purpose of this paper is to describe in detail the methods that will be used to estimate the incremental costs and cost-effectiveness of the interventions. The base-case analysis will adopt a societal perspective, including the direct medical and non-medical costs borne by the government and patients. The cost of the interventions will be calculated by the ingredients approach, in which the total quantities of goods and services actually employed in applying the interventions will be estimated, and multiplied by their respective unit prices. Relevant information on costs of interventions will be obtained mainly from administrative records. The costs borne by patients will be collected via exit and telephone interviews. An annual discount rate of 8% will be used, consistent with the rate recommended by the Government of Chile. All costs will be converted from Chilean Peso to US dollars with the 2007 average period exchange rate of US$1 = 522.37 Chilean Peso. To test the robustness of model results, we will vary the assumptions over a plausible range in sensitivity analyses. The protocol described here indicates our intent to conduct an economic evaluation alongside the CENEX study. It provides a detailed and transparent statement of planned data collection methods and analyses. ISRCTN48153354.
1 Species delimitation and phylogeny of a New Zealand plant species radiation. Delimiting species boundaries and reconstructing the evolutionary relationships of late Tertiary and Quaternary species radiations is difficult. One recent approach emphasizes the use of genome-wide molecular markers, such as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to identify distinct metapopulation lineages as taxonomic species. Here we investigate the properties of AFLP data, and the usefulness of tree-based and non-tree-based clustering methods to delimit species and reconstruct evolutionary relationships among high-elevation Ourisia species (Plantaginaceae) in the New Zealand archipelago. New Zealand Ourisia are shown to comprise a geologically recent species radiation based on molecular dating analyses of ITS sequences (0.4-1.3 MY). Supernetwork analyses indicate that separate tree-based clustering analyses of four independent AFLP primer combinations and 193 individuals of Ourisia produced similar trees. When combined and analysed using tree building methods, 15 distinct metapopulations could be identified. These clusters corresponded very closely to species and subspecies identified on the basis of diagnostic morphological characters. In contrast, Structure and PCO-MC analyses of the same data identified a maximum of 12 and 8 metapopulations, respectively. All approaches resolved a large-leaved group and a small-leaved group, as well as a lineage of three alpine species within the small-leaved group. We were unable to further resolve relationships within these groups as corrected and uncorrected distances derived from AFLP profiles had limited tree-like properties. Ourisia radiated into a range of alpine and subalpine habitats in New Zealand during the Pleistocene, resulting in 13 morphologically and ecologically distinct species, including one reinstated from subspecies rank. Analyses of AFLP identified distinct metapopulations consistent with morphological characters allowing species boundaries to be delimited in Ourisia. Importantly, Structure analyses suggest some degree of admixture with most species, which may also explain why the AFLP data do not exhibit sufficient tree-like properties necessary for reconstructing some species relationships. We discuss this feature and highlight the importance of improving models for phylogenetic analyses of species radiations using AFLP and SNP data.
0 In silico identification of a core regulatory network of OCT4 in human embryonic stem cells using an integrated approach. The transcription factor OCT4 is highly expressed in pluripotent embryonic stem cells which are derived from the inner cell mass of mammalian blastocysts. Pluripotency and self renewal are controlled by a transcription regulatory network governed by the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG. Recent studies on reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells highlight OCT4 as a key regulator of pluripotency. We have carried out an integrated analysis of high-throughput data (ChIP-on-chip and RNAi experiments along with promoter sequence analysis of putative target genes) and identified a core OCT4 regulatory network in human embryonic stem cells consisting of 33 target genes. Enrichment analysis with these target genes revealed that this integrative analysis increases the functional information content by factors of 1.3 - 4.7 compared to the individual studies. In order to identify potential regulatory co-factors of OCT4, we performed a de novo motif analysis. In addition to known validated OCT4 motifs we obtained binding sites similar to motifs recognized by further regulators of pluripotency and development; e.g. the heterodimer of the transcription factors C-MYC and MAX, a prerequisite for C-MYC transcriptional activity that leads to cell growth and proliferation. Our analysis shows how heterogeneous functional information can be integrated in order to reconstruct gene regulatory networks. As a test case we identified a core OCT4-regulated network that is important for the analysis of stem cell characteristics and cellular differentiation. Functional information is largely enriched using different experimental results. The de novo motif discovery identified well-known regulators closely connected to the OCT4 network as well as potential new regulators of pluripotency and differentiation. These results provide the basis for further targeted functional studies.
1 Evaluating regional blood spinal cord barrier dysfunction following spinal cord injury using longitudinal dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. In vivo preclinical imaging of spinal cord injury (SCI) in rodent models provides clinically relevant information in translational research. This paper uses multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate neurovascular pathology and changes in blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability following SCI in a mouse model of SCI. C57BL/6 female mice (n = 5) were subjected to contusive injury at the thoracic T11 level and scanned on post injury days 1 and 3 using anatomical, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The injured cords were evaluated postmortem with histopathological stains specific to neurovascular changes. A computational model was implemented to map local changes in barrier function from the contrast enhancement. The area and volume of spinal cord tissue with dysfunctional barrier were determined using semi-automatic segmentation. Quantitative maps derived from the acquired DCE-MRI data depicted the degree of BSCB permeability variations in injured spinal cords. At the injury sites, the damaged barriers occupied about 70% of the total cross section and 48% of the total volume on day 1, but the corresponding measurements were reduced to 55% and 25%, respectively on day 3. These changes implied spatio-temporal remodeling of microvasculature and its architecture in injured SC. Diffusion computations included longitudinal and transverse diffusivities and fractional anisotropy index. Comparison of permeability and diffusion measurements indicated regions of injured cords with dysfunctional barriers had structural changes in the form of greater axonal loss and demyelination, as supported by histopathologic assessments. The results from this study collectively demonstrated the feasibility of quantitatively mapping regional BSCB dysfunction in injured cord in mouse and obtaining complementary information about its structural integrity using in vivo DCE-MRI and DTI protocols. This capability is expected to play an important role in characterizing the neurovascular changes and reorganization following SCI in longitudinal preclinical experiments, but with potential clinical implications.
0 The spatial and temporal patterns of falciparum and vivax malaria in Perú: 1994-2006. Malaria is the direct cause of approximately one million deaths worldwide each year, though it is both preventable and curable. Increasing the understanding of the transmission dynamics of falciparum and vivax malaria and their relationship could suggest improvements for malaria control efforts. Here the weekly number of malaria cases due to Plasmodium falciparum (1994-2006) and Plasmodium vivax (1999-2006) in Perú at different spatial scales in conjunction with associated demographic, geographic and climatological data are analysed. Malaria periodicity patterns were analysed through wavelet spectral analysis, studied patterns of persistence as a function of community size and assessed spatial heterogeneity via the Lorenz curve and the summary Gini index. Wavelet time series analyses identified annual cycles in the incidence of both malaria species as the dominant pattern. However, significant spatial heterogeneity was observed across jungle, mountain and coastal regions with slightly higher levels of spatial heterogeneity for P. vivax than P. falciparum. While the incidence of P. falciparum has been declining in recent years across geographic regions, P. vivax incidence has remained relatively steady in jungle and mountain regions with a slight decline in coastal regions. Factors that may be contributing to this decline are discussed. The time series of both malaria species were significantly synchronized in coastal (rho = 0.9, P < 0.0001) and jungle regions (rho = 0.76, P < 0.0001) but not in mountain regions. Community size was significantly associated with malaria persistence due to both species in jungle regions, but not in coastal and mountain regions. Overall, findings highlight the importance of highly refined spatial and temporal data on malaria incidence together with demographic and geographic information in improving the understanding of malaria persistence patterns associated with multiple malaria species in human populations, impact of interventions, detection of heterogeneity and generation of hypotheses.
0 Climate change, habitat loss, protected areas and the climate adaptation potential of species in mediterranean ecosystems worldwide. Mediterranean climate is found on five continents and supports five global biodiversity hotspots. Based on combined downscaled results from 23 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) for three emissions scenarios, we determined the projected spatial shifts in the mediterranean climate extent (MCE) over the next century. Although most AOGCMs project a moderate expansion in the global MCE, regional impacts are large and uneven. The median AOGCM simulation output for the three emissions scenarios project the MCE at the end of the 21(st) century in Chile will range from 129-153% of its current size, while in Australia, it will contract to only 77-49% of its current size losing an area equivalent to over twice the size of Portugal. Only 4% of the land area within the current MCE worldwide is in protected status (compared to a global average of 12% for all biome types), and, depending on the emissions scenario, only 50-60% of these protected areas are likely to be in the future MCE. To exacerbate the climate impact, nearly one third (29-31%) of the land where the MCE is projected to remain stable has already been converted to human use, limiting the size of the potential climate refuges and diminishing the adaptation potential of native biota. High conversion and low protection in projected stable areas make Australia the highest priority region for investment in climate-adaptation strategies to reduce the threat of climate change to the rich biodiversity of the mediterranean biome.
3 LitInspector: literature and signal transduction pathway mining in PubMed abstracts. LitInspector is a literature search tool providing gene and signal transduction pathway mining within NCBI's PubMed database. The automatic gene recognition and color coding increases the readability of abstracts and significantly speeds up literature research. A main challenge in gene recognition is the resolution of homonyms and rejection of identical abbreviations used in a 'non-gene' context. LitInspector uses automatically generated and manually refined filtering lists for this purpose. The quality of the LitInspector results was assessed with a published dataset of 181 PubMed sentences. LitInspector achieved a precision of 96.8%, a recall of 86.6% and an F-measure of 91.4%. To further demonstrate the homonym resolution qualities, LitInspector was compared to three other literature search tools using some challenging examples. The homonym MIZ-1 (gene IDs 7709 and 9063) was correctly resolved in 87% of the abstracts by LitInspector, whereas the other tools achieved recognition rates between 35% and 67%. The LitInspector signal transduction pathway mining is based on a manually curated database of pathway names (e.g. wingless type), pathway components (e.g. WNT1, FZD1), and general pathway keywords (e.g. signaling cascade). The performance was checked for 10 randomly selected genes. Eighty-two per cent of the 38 predicted pathway associations were correct. LitInspector is freely available at http://www.litinspector.org/.
0 Tooth discoloration in patients with neonatal diabetes after transfer onto glibenclamide: a previously unreported side effect. OBJECTIVE To assess if tooth discoloration is a novel side effect of sulfonylurea therapy in patients with permanent neonatal diabetes due to mutations in KCNJ11. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 67 patients with a known KCNJ11 mutation who had been successfully transferred from insulin injections onto oral sulfonylureas were contacted and asked about the development of tooth discoloration after transfer. RESULTS Altered tooth appearance was identified in 5 of the 67 patients. This was variable in severity, ranging from mild discoloration/staining (n = 4) to loss of enamel (n = 1) and was only seen in patients taking glibenclamide (glyburide). CONCLUSIONS These previously unreported side effects may relate to the developing tooth and/or to the high local concentrations in the children who frequently chewed glibenclamide tablets or took it as a concentrated solution. Given the multiple benefits of sulfonylurea treatment for patients with activating KCNJ11 mutations, this association warrants further investigation but should not preclude such treatment.
2 Synergistic drug combinations tend to improve therapeutically relevant selectivity. Drug combinations are a promising strategy to overcome the compensatory mechanisms and unwanted off-target effects that limit the utility of many potential drugs. However, enthusiasm for this approach is tempered by concerns that the therapeutic synergy of a combination will be accompanied by synergistic side effects. Using large scale simulations of bacterial metabolism and 94,110 multi-dose experiments relevant to diverse diseases, we provide evidence that synergistic drug combinations are generally more specific to particular cellular contexts than are single agent activities. We highlight six combinations whose selective synergy depends on multitarget drug activity. For one anti-inflammatory example, we show how such selectivity is achieved through differential expression of the drugs' targets in cell types associated with therapeutic, but not toxic, effects and validate its therapeutic relevance in a rat model of asthma. The context specificity of synergistic combinations creates many opportunities for therapeutically relevant selectivity and enables improved control of complex biological systems.
3 Deoxyamphimedine, a pyridoacridine alkaloid, damages DNA via the production of reactive oxygen species. Marine pyridoacridines are a class of aromatic chemicals that share an 11H-pyrido[4,3,2-mn]acridine skeleton. Pyridoacridine alkaloids display diverse biological activities including cytotoxicity, fungicidal and bactericidal properties, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and topoisomerase inhibition. These activities are often dependent on slight modifications to the pyridoacridine skeleton. Here we demonstrate that while structurally similar to neoamphimedine and amphimedine, the biological activity of deoxyamphimedine differs greatly. Deoxyamphimedine damages DNA in vitro independent of topoisomerase enzymes through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Its activity was decreased in low oxygen, with the removal of a reducing agent and in the presence of anti-oxidants. Deoxyamphimedine also showed enhanced toxicity in cells sensitive to single or double strand DNA breaks, consistent with the in vitro activity.
3 Overexpression of CCL-21/secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine in human dendritic cells augments chemotactic activities for lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells. Ex vivo generated dendritic cells (DC) genetically modified to express secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (CCL-21/SLC) have been shown to stimulate potent antitumor responses in murine models. When injected intratumorally, CCL-21 colocalizes DC and lymphocyte effector cells at the tumor site. This may improve tumor antigen presentation and T cell activation by utilizing the tumor as an in vivo source of antigen for DC. In order to develop DC-based cancer therapies for intratumoral injection that could promote tumor antigen uptake and presentation in situ, we constructed and characterized an adenoviral vector that expresses human CCL-21 (AdCCL-21). Human monocyte derived DC were cultured in GM-CSF and IL-4 for 6 days. Following AdCCL-21 transduction, CCL-21 protein production was assessed by ELISA on day 8. DC transduced with AdCCL-21 at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 50:1 or 100:1 produced up to 210 +/- 9 ng/ml and 278 +/- 6.5 ng/ml /106 cells/48 hours, respectively. Following transduction, an immature DC phenotype was maintained and an upregulation of the costimulatory molecule, CD86 was noted. In addition, supernatant from AdCCL-21-DC caused significant chemotaxis of peripheral blood lymphocytes and mature DC. These studies demonstrate that AdCCL-21-DC generate functional levels of CCL-21 without adversely altering DC phenotype. These findings strengthen the rationale for further investigation of AdCCL-21-DC as a DC-based therapy in cancer treatment.
3 Hypoglycemia unawareness in older compared with middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE Older patients with type 2 diabetes are at a particularly high risk for severe hypoglycemic episodes, and experimental studies in healthy subjects hint at a reduced awareness of hypoglycemia in aged humans. However, subjective responses to hypoglycemia have rarely been assessed in older type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We tested hormonal, subjective, and cognitive responses (reaction time) to 30-min steady-state hypoglycemia at a level of 2.8 mmol/l in 13 older (> or =65 years) and 13 middle-aged (39-64 years) type 2 diabetic patients. RESULTS Hormonal counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia did not differ between older and middle-aged patients. In contrast, middle-aged patients showed a pronounced increase in autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptom scores at the end of the hypoglycemic plateau that was not observed in older patients (both P < 0.01). Also, seven middle-aged patients, but only one older participant, correctly estimated their blood glucose concentration to be <3.3 mmol/l during hypoglycemia (P = 0.011). A profound prolongation of reaction times induced by hypoglycemia in both groups persisted even after 30 min of subsequent euglycemia. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate marked subjective unawareness of hypoglycemia in older type 2 diabetic patients that does not depend on altered neuroendocrine counterregulation and may contribute to the increased probability of severe hypoglycemia frequently reported in these patients. The joint occurrence of hypoglycemia unawareness and deteriorated cognitive function is a critical factor to be carefully considered in the treatment of older patients.
1 Quantifying inter- and intra-population niche variability using hierarchical bayesian stable isotope mixing models. Variability in resource use defines the width of a trophic niche occupied by a population. Intra-population variability in resource use may occur across hierarchical levels of population structure from individuals to subpopulations. Understanding how levels of population organization contribute to population niche width is critical to ecology and evolution. Here we describe a hierarchical stable isotope mixing model that can simultaneously estimate both the prey composition of a consumer diet and the diet variability among individuals and across levels of population organization. By explicitly estimating variance components for multiple scales, the model can deconstruct the niche width of a consumer population into relevant levels of population structure. We apply this new approach to stable isotope data from a population of gray wolves from coastal British Columbia, and show support for extensive intra-population niche variability among individuals, social groups, and geographically isolated subpopulations. The analytic method we describe improves mixing models by accounting for diet variability, and improves isotope niche width analysis by quantitatively assessing the contribution of levels of organization to the niche width of a population.
1 Masitinib in the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis: results of a multicentre, open-label, dose-ranging, phase 2a study. Since current treatment options for patients suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remain inadequate, especially for those unresponsive to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), new and improved medication is needed. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of masitinib (AB1010), a potent and selective protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor of c-KIT, in the monotherapy treatment of DMARD-refractory RA. This was a multicentre, uncontrolled, open-label, randomised, dose-ranging, phase 2a trial. Masitinib was administered orally to 43 patients who had inadequate response to DMARDs, at initial randomised dosing levels of 3 and 6 mg/kg per day over a 12-week period. Dose adjustment was permitted based upon tolerability and response criteria. Efficacy was assessed via American College of Rheumatology 20%/50%/70% improvement criteria (ACR20/50/70) responses, disease activity score using 28 joint counts (DAS28), index of improvement in RA (ACRn) and C-reactive protein (CRP) improvement, relative to baseline at week 12. Improvement was observed in all efficacy endpoints, including ACR20/50/70 scores of 54%, 26% and 8%, respectively, and a reduction in CRP level by greater than 50% for approximately half the population. This improvement was sustainable throughout an extension phase (> 84 weeks) and was also independent of initial DMARD resistance (anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha and/or methotrexate). A relatively high patient withdrawal rate (37%) required the use of last observation carried forward (LOCF) data imputation. Incidence of adverse events was high (95%), although the majority were of mild or moderate severity with a considerable decline in frequency observed after 12 weeks of treatment. Two nonfatal serious adverse events were reported. Dose-response analyses tentatively indicate that an initial dosing level of 6.0 mg/kg per day administered orally in two daily intakes is the most appropriate, based upon potency and tolerability trends. Treatment with masitinib improved DMARD-refractory active RA. Following an initial high incidence of mostly mild to moderate side effects during the first 12 weeks of treatment, masitinib appears to be generally well tolerated. This, together with evidence of a sustainable efficacy response, suggests that masitinib is suitable for long-term treatment regimens. Since this was the first study of masitinib in a nononcologic pathology, the relatively high patient withdrawal rate observed can be partly attributed to a highly cautious response to adverse events. There is sufficient compelling evidence to warrant further placebo-controlled investigation. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00831922.
1 Coordinated patterns of gene expressions for adult muscle build-up in transgenic mice expressing myostatin propeptide. Skeletal muscle growth and maintenance are essential for human health. One of the muscle regulatory genes, namely myostatin, a member of transforming growth factor-beta, plays a dominant role in the genetic control of muscle mass. Myostatin is synthesized as a precursor protein, which generates the N-terminal propeptide and the C-terminal mature myostatin peptide by a post-translational cleavage event. Previously, transgenic over-expression of myostatin propeptide in skeletal muscle results in significant muscle growth in early stages of development. The objectives of present study were to further characterize muscle growth in later stages of life and to identify genes and their expression patterns that are responsible for adult muscle build-up by myostatin propeptide. Immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to the N-terminus indicates a high level of myostatin propeptide present in the muscles of transgenic mice while there were no apparent differences in myostatin protein distribution in the muscle fibers between the transgenic and wild-type mice. Main individual muscles increased by 76-152% in the transgenic mice over their wild-type littermate mice at 12 months of age. A large number of nuclei were localized in the central and basal lamina of the myofibers in the transgenic mice as the number of nuclei per fiber and 100 microm(2) area was significantly higher in transgenic mice than wild-type mice. By systemic comparisons of global mRNA expression patterns between transgenic mice and wild-type littermates using microarray and qRT-PCR techniques, we have identified distinct gene expression patterns to support adult muscle build-up by myostatin propeptide, which are comprised of enhanced expressions of myogenic regulatory factors and extracelullar matrix components, and differentially down-regulated expressions of genes related to protein degradation and mitochondrial ATP synthesis. The results present a coordinated pattern of gene expressions for reduced energy utilization during muscle build-up in adult stage. Enhanced muscle buildup by myostatin propeptide is sustained by reduced ATP synthesis as a result of a decreased activity of protein degradation. Myostatin propeptide may have a therapeutic application to the treatment of clinical muscle wasting problems by depressing myostatin activity.
1 GHb level and subsequent mortality among adults in the U.S. OBJECTIVE To examine the association of hyperglycemia, as measured by GHb, with subsequent mortality in a nationally representative sample of adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We included adults aged > or =20 years who participated in Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) and had complete information, including baseline diabetes status by self-report and measured GHb (n = 19,025) and follow-up through the end of 2000 for mortality. RESULTS In the overall population, higher levels of GHb were associated with increased risk of mortality from all causes, heart disease, and cancer. After adjustment for potential risk factors, the relative hazard (RH) for adults with GHb > or =8% compared with adults with GHb <6% was 2.59 (95% CI 1.88-3.56) for all-cause mortality, 3.38 (1.98-5.77) for heart disease mortality, and 2.64 (1.17-5.97) for cancer mortality. Among adults with diagnosed diabetes, having GHb > or =8% compared with GHb <6% was associated with higher all-cause mortality (RH 1.68, 95% CI 1.03-2.74) and heart disease mortality (2.48, 1.09-5.64), but there was no increased risk of cancer mortality by GHb category. Among adults without diagnosed diabetes, there was no significant association of all-cause, heart disease, or cancer mortality and GHb category. CONCLUSIONS These results highlight the importance of GHb levels in mortality risk among a nationally representative sample of adults with and without diagnosed diabetes and indicate that higher levels are associated with increased mortality in adults with diabetes.
1 Poor glycemic control is an independent risk factor for low HDL cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE To determine whether the association observed between poor glycemic control and low HDL cholesterol in type 2 diabetes is dependent on obesity and/or hypertriglyceridemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study of 1,819 patients with type 2 diabetes and triglycerides <400 mg/dl enrolled at three diabetes centers in Italy. The risk for low HDL cholesterol was analyzed as a function of A1C levels. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated after adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS A 1% increase in A1C significantly increased the risk for low HDL cholesterol (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.1-1.2], P = 0.00072); no changes were observed when age, sex, smoking, and lipid-lowering therapy were included in the model (1.17 [1.1-1.2], P = 0.00044). The association remained strong after adjustments for obesity and hypertriglyceridemia in multivariate analysis (1.12 [1.05-1.18], P = 0.00017). CONCLUSIONS Poor glycemic control appears to be an independent risk factor for low HDL cholesterol in type 2 diabetes.
1 Anchoring secreted proteins in endoplasmic reticulum by plant oleosin: the example of vitamin B12 cellular sequestration by transcobalamin. Oleosin is a plant protein localized to lipid droplets and endoplasmic reticulum of plant cells. Our idea was to use it to target functional secretory proteins of interest to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells, through expressing oleosin-containing chimeras. We have designed this approach to create cellular models deficient in vitamin B12 (cobalamin) because of the known problematics associated to the obtainment of effective vitamin B12 deficient cell models. This was achieved by the overexpression of transcobalamin inside cells through anchoring to oleosin. chimera gene constructs including transcobalamin-oleosin (TC-O), green fluorescent protein-transcobalamin-oleosin (GFP-TC-O) and oleosin-transcobalamin (O-TC) were inserted into pAcSG2 and pCDNA3 vectors for expression in sf9 insect cells, Caco2 (colon carcinoma), NIE-115 (mouse neuroblastoma), HEK (human embryonic kidney), COS-7 (Green Monkey SV40-transfected kidney fibroblasts) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary cells). The subcellular localization, the changes in vitamin B12 binding activity and the metabolic consequences were investigated in both Caco2 and NIE-115 cells. vitamin B12 binding was dramatically higher in TC-O than that in O-TC and wild type (WT). The expression of GFP-TC-O was observed in all cell lines and found to be co-localized with an ER-targeted red fluorescent protein and calreticulin of the endoplasmic reticulum in Caco2 and COS-7 cells. The overexpression of TC-O led to B12 deficiency, evidenced by impaired conversion of cyano-cobalamin to ado-cobalamin and methyl-cobalamin, decreased methionine synthase activity and reduced S-adenosyl methionine to S-adenosyl homocysteine ratio, as well as increases in homocysteine and methylmalonic acid concentration. the heterologous expression of TC-O in mammalian cells can be used as an effective strategy for investigating the cellular consequences of vitamin B12 deficiency. More generally, expression of oleosin-anchored proteins could be an interesting tool in cell engineering for studying proteins of pharmacological interest.
0 Seasonal movements, aggregations and diving behavior of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) revealed with archival tags. Electronic tags were used to examine the seasonal movements, aggregations and diving behaviors of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) to better understand their migration ecology and oceanic habitat utilization. Implantable archival tags (n = 561) were deployed in bluefin tuna from 1996 to 2005 and 106 tags were recovered. Movement paths of the fish were reconstructed using light level and sea-surface-temperature-based geolocation estimates. To quantify habitat utilization we employed a weighted kernel estimation technique that removed the biases of deployment location and track length. Throughout the North Atlantic, high residence times (167+/-33 days) were identified in four spatially confined regions on a seasonal scale. Within each region, bluefin tuna experienced distinct temperature regimes and displayed different diving behaviors. The mean diving depths within the high-use areas were significantly shallower and the dive frequency and the variance in internal temperature significantly higher than during transit movements between the high-use areas. Residence time in the more northern latitude high-use areas was significantly correlated with levels of primary productivity. The regions of aggregation are associated with areas of abundant prey and potentially represent critical foraging habitats that have seasonally abundant prey. Throughout the North Atlantic mean diving depth was significantly correlated with the depth of the thermocline, and dive behavior changed in relation to the stratification of the water column. In this study, with numerous multi-year tracks, there appear to be repeatable patterns of clear aggregation areas that potentially are changing with environmental conditions. The high concentrations of bluefin tuna in predictable locations indicate that Atlantic bluefin tuna are vulnerable to concentrated fishing efforts in the regions of foraging aggregations.
2 (124)I-L19-SIP for immuno-PET imaging of tumour vasculature and guidance of (131)I-L19-SIP radioimmunotherapy. The human monoclonal antibody (MAb) fragment L19-SIP is directed against extra domain B (ED-B) of fibronectin, a marker of tumour angiogenesis. A clinical radioimmunotherapy (RIT) trial with (131)I-L19-SIP was recently started. In the present study, after GMP production of (124)I and efficient production of (124)I-L19-SIP, we aimed to demonstrate the suitability of (124)I-L19-SIP immuno-PET for imaging of angiogenesis at early-stage tumour development and as a scouting procedure prior to clinical (131)I-L19-SIP RIT. (124)I was produced in a GMP compliant way via (124)Te(p,n)(124)I reaction and using a TERIMO module for radioiodine separation. L19-SIP was radioiodinated by using a modified version of the IODO-GEN method. The biodistribution of coinjected (124)I- and (131)I-L19-SIP was compared in FaDu xenograft-bearing nude mice, while (124)I PET images were obtained from mice with tumours of <50 to approximately 700 mm(3). (124)I was produced highly pure with an average yield of 15.4 +/- 0.5 MBq/microAh, while separation yield was approximately 90% efficient with <0.5% loss of TeO(2). Overall labelling efficiency, radiochemical purity and immunoreactive fraction were for (124)I-L19-SIP: approximately 80 , 99.9 and >90%, respectively. Tumour uptake was 7.3 +/- 2.1, 10.8 +/- 1.5, 7.8 +/- 1.4, 5.3 +/- 0.6 and 3.1 +/- 0.4%ID/g at 3, 6, 24, 48 and 72 h p.i., resulting in increased tumour to blood ratios ranging from 6.0 at 24 h to 45.9 at 72 h p.i.. Fully concordant labelling and biodistribution results were obtained with (124)I- and (131)I-L19-SIP. Immuno-PET with (124)I-L19-SIP using a high-resolution research tomograph PET scanner revealed clear delineation of the tumours as small as 50 mm(3) and no adverse uptake in other organs. (124)I-MAb conjugates for clinical immuno-PET can be efficiently produced. Immuno-PET with (124)I-L19-SIP appeared qualified for sensitive imaging of tumour neovasculature and for predicting (131)I-L19-SIP biodistribution.
3 Enhanced glucose tolerance by SK4 channel inhibition in pancreatic beta-cells. Ca(2+)-regulated K(+) channels are involved in numerous Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways. In this study, we investigated whether the Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel of intermediate conductance SK4 (KCa3.1, IK1) plays a physiological role in pancreatic beta-cell function. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were determined in wild-type (WT) or SK4 knockout (SK4-KO) mice. Electrophysiological experiments were performed with the patch-clamp technique. The cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) was determined by fura-2 fluorescence. Insulin release was assessed by radioimmunoassay, and SK4 protein was detected by Western blot analysis. SK4-KO mice showed improved glucose tolerance, whereas insulin sensitivity was not altered. The animals were not hypoglycemic. Isolated SK4-KO beta-cells stimulated with 15 mmol/l glucose had an increased Ca(2+) action potential frequency, and single-action potentials were broadened. These alterations were coupled to increased [Ca(2+)](c). In addition, glucose responsiveness of membrane potential, [Ca(2+)](c), and insulin secretion were shifted to lower glucose concentrations. SK4 protein was expressed in WT islets. An increase in K(+) currents and concomitant membrane hyperpolarization could be evoked in WT beta-cells by the SK4 channel opener DCEBIO (100 micromol/l). Accordingly, the SK4 channel blocker TRAM-34 (1 micromol/l) partly inhibited K(Ca) currents and induced electrical activity at a threshold glucose concentration. In stimulated WT beta-cells, TRAM-34 further increased [Ca(2+)](c) and broadened action potentials similar to those seen in SK4-KO beta-cells. SK4 channels were found to substantially contribute to K(slow) (slowly activating K(+) current). SK4 channels are involved in beta-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. Deficiency of SK4 current induces elevated beta-cell responsiveness and coincides with improved glucose tolerance in vivo. Therefore, pharmacologic modulation of these channels might provide an interesting approach for the development of novel insulinotropic drugs.
0 QMEANclust: estimation of protein model quality by combining a composite scoring function with structural density information. The selection of the most accurate protein model from a set of alternatives is a crucial step in protein structure prediction both in template-based and ab initio approaches. Scoring functions have been developed which can either return a quality estimate for a single model or derive a score from the information contained in the ensemble of models for a given sequence. Local structural features occurring more frequently in the ensemble have a greater probability of being correct. Within the context of the CASP experiment, these so called consensus methods have been shown to perform considerably better in selecting good candidate models, but tend to fail if the best models are far from the dominant structural cluster. In this paper we show that model selection can be improved if both approaches are combined by pre-filtering the models used during the calculation of the structural consensus. Our recently published QMEAN composite scoring function has been improved by including an all-atom interaction potential term. The preliminary model ranking based on the new QMEAN score is used to select a subset of reliable models against which the structural consensus score is calculated. This scoring function called QMEANclust achieves a correlation coefficient of predicted quality score and GDT_TS of 0.9 averaged over the 98 CASP7 targets and perform significantly better in selecting good models from the ensemble of server models than any other groups participating in the quality estimation category of CASP7. Both scoring functions are also benchmarked on the MOULDER test set consisting of 20 target proteins each with 300 alternatives models generated by MODELLER. QMEAN outperforms all other tested scoring functions operating on individual models, while the consensus method QMEANclust only works properly on decoy sets containing a certain fraction of near-native conformations. We also present a local version of QMEAN for the per-residue estimation of model quality (QMEANlocal) and compare it to a new local consensus-based approach. Improved model selection is obtained by using a composite scoring function operating on single models in order to enrich higher quality models which are subsequently used to calculate the structural consensus. The performance of consensus-based methods such as QMEANclust highly depends on the composition and quality of the model ensemble to be analysed. Therefore, performance estimates for consensus methods based on large meta-datasets (e.g. CASP) might overrate their applicability in more realistic modelling situations with smaller sets of models based on individual methods.
3 Increases in norepinephrine release and ovarian cyst formation during ageing in the rat. Depletion of ovarian follicles is associated with the end of reproductive function in ageing females. Recently, it has been described that this process parallels increases in the concentration of norepinephrine (NE) in the rat ovary. In sexually mature rats, experimentally-induced increases in the sympathetic tone of the ovary is causally related to ovarian cyst formation and deranged follicular development. Thus, there is a possibility that increased ovarian NE concentrations represent changes in the activity of sympathetic nerves, which consequently participate in the process of ovarian cyst formation observed during ageing in the human and experimental animal models. Sprague-Dawley rats between 6 and 14 months old were used to analyse the capacity of the ovary to release 3H-NE recently incorporated under transmural depolarisation in relation to changes in the ovarian follicular population. Morphometric analysis of ovarian follicles and real time PCR for Bcl2 and Bax mRNA were used to assess follicular atresia. From 8 months old, the induced release of recently incorporated 3H-norepinephrine (3H-NE) from the ovary and ovarian NE concentrations increased, reaching their peak values at 12 months old and remained elevated up to 14 months old. Increases in sympathetic nerve activity paralleled changes in the follicular population, as well as disappearance of the corpus luteum. In contrast, luteinised follicles, precystic follicles, and cystic follicles increased. During this period, the relationship between Bax and Bcl2 mRNAs (the proapoptotic/antiapoptotic signals) increased, suggesting atresia as the principal mechanism contributing to the decreased follicular population. When NE tone was increased, the mRNA ratio favoured Bcl2 to Bax and antiapoptotic signals dominated this period of development. Thus, these changing ratios could be responsible for the increase in luteinised follicles, as well as precystic and cystic follicles. These data suggest that the ageing process in the ovary of the Sprague-Dawley rat is accompanied by an increased sympathetic tone of the ovary. Consequently, this sympathetic change could be related to a neuroendocrine-driven formation of a polycystic condition similar to that observed in the sympathetic-activated adult ovary.
2 Determining the status of non-transferred embryos in Ireland: a conspectus of case law and implications for clinical IVF practice. The development of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) as a treatment for human infertilty was among the most controversial medical achievements of the modern era. In Ireland, the fate and status of supranumary (non-transferred) embryos derived from IVF brings challenges both for clinical practice and public health policy because there is no judicial or legislative framework in place to address the medical, scientific, or ethical uncertainties. Complex legal issues exist regarding informed consent and ownership of embryos, particularly the use of non-transferred embryos if a couple separates or divorces. But since case law is only beginning to emerge from outside Ireland and because legislation on IVF and human embryo status is entirely absent here, this matter is poised to raise contractual, constitutional and property law issues at the highest level. Our analysis examines this medico-legal challenge in an Irish context, and summarises key decisions on this issue rendered from other jurisdictions. The contractual issues raised by the Roche case regarding informed consent and the implications the initial judgment may have for future disputes over embryos are also discussed. Our research also considers a putative Constitutional 'right to procreate' and the implications EU law may have for an Irish case concerning the fate of frozen embryos. Since current Medical Council guidelines are insufficient to ensure appropriate regulation of the advanced reproductive technologies in Ireland, the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction is most likely to influence embryo custody disputes. Public policy requires the establishment and implementation of a more comprehensive legislative framework within which assisted reproductive medical services are offered.
3 AAA+ Ring and linker swing mechanism in the dynein motor. Dynein ATPases power diverse microtubule-based motilities. Each dynein motor domain comprises a ring-like head containing six AAA+ modules and N- and C-terminal regions, together with a stalk that binds microtubules. How these subdomains are arranged and generate force remains poorly understood. Here, using electron microscopy and image processing of tagged and truncated Dictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein constructs, we show that the heart of the motor is a hexameric ring of AAA+ modules, with the stalk emerging opposite the primary ATPase site (AAA1). The C-terminal region is not an integral part of the ring but spans between AAA6 and near the stalk base. The N-terminal region includes a lever-like linker whose N terminus swings by approximately 17 nm during the ATPase cycle between AAA2 and the stalk base. Together with evidence of stalk tilting, which may communicate changes in microtubule binding affinity, these findings suggest a model for dynein's structure and mechanism.
0 Talin 2 is a large and complex gene encoding multiple transcripts and protein isoforms. Talins are large adaptor proteins that link the integrin family of adhesion molecules to F-actin. In vertebrates, there are two talin genes. Talin 1 is essential for integrin-mediated cell adhesion; the role of talin 2 is unclear. Here we report a detailed analysis of mammalian talin 2. This reveals the existence of a previously unrecognized promoter associated with a CpG island, and separated from the first coding exon by numerous alternatively spliced noncoding exons spanning > 200 kb. Analysis of a mouse gene trap line shows that this promoter accounts for most of the talin 2 expression in adult tissues. We also demonstrate that testis and kidney express truncated talin 2 isoforms that lack the N-terminal half of the protein, and provide evidence for the developmentally regulated expression of the short testis-specific talin 2 isoform in elongating spermatids. Finally, we identify four tissue-specific alternative splicing events within the coding region of talin 2.
3 Improving education in primary care: development of an online curriculum using the blended learning model. Standardizing the experiences of medical students in a community preceptorship where clinical sites vary by geography and discipline can be challenging. Computer-assisted learning is prevalent in medical education and can help standardize experiences, but often is not used to its fullest advantage. A blended learning curriculum combining web-based modules with face-to-face learning can ensure students obtain core curricular principles. This course was developed and used at The Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and its associated preceptorship sites in the greater Cleveland area. Leaders of a two-year elective continuity experience at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine used adult learning principles to develop four interactive online modules presenting basics of office practice, difficult patient interviews, common primary care diagnoses, and disease prevention. They can be viewed at (http://casemed.case.edu/cpcp/curriculum). Students completed surveys rating the content and technical performance of each module and completed a Generalist OSCE exam at the end of the course. Participating students rated all aspects of the course highly; particularly those related to charting and direct patient care. Additionally, they scored very well on the Generalist OSCE exam. Students found the web-based modules to be valuable and to enhance their clinical learning. The blended learning model is a useful tool in designing web-based curriculum for enhancing the clinical curriculum of medical students.
1 Early and long-standing rheumatoid arthritis: distinct molecular signatures identified by gene-expression profiling in synovia. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a heterogeneous disease and its underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Because previous microarray studies have only focused on long-standing (LS) RA compared to osteoarthritis, we aimed to compare the molecular profiles of early and LS RA versus control synovia. Synovial biopsies were obtained by arthroscopy from 15 patients (4 early untreated RA, 4 treated LS RA and 7 controls, who had traumatic or mechanical lesions). Extracted mRNAs were used for large-scale gene-expression profiling. The different gene-expression combinations identified by comparison of profiles of early, LS RA and healthy synovia were linked to the biological processes involved in each situation. Three combinations of 719, 116 and 52 transcripts discriminated, respectively, early from LS RA, and early or LS RA from healthy synovia. We identified several gene clusters and distinct molecular signatures specifically expressed during early or LS RA, thereby suggesting the involvement of different pathophysiological mechanisms during the course of RA. Early and LS RA have distinct molecular signatures with different biological processes participating at different times during the course of the disease. These results suggest that better knowledge of the main biological processes involved at a given RA stage might help to choose the most appropriate treatment.

1 Cancer borealis stomatogastric nervous system dissection. The stomatogastric ganglion (STG) is an excellent model for studying cellular and network interactions because it contains a relatively small number of cells (approximately 25 in C. borealis) which are well characterized. The cells in the STG exhibit a broad range of outputs and are responsible for the motor actions of the stomach. The stomach contains the gastric mill which breaks down food with three internal teeth, and the pylorus which filters the food before it reaches the midgut. The STG produces two rhythmic outputs to control the gastric mill and pylorus known as central pattern generators (CPGs). Each cell in the STG can participate in one or both of these rhythms. These CPGs allow for the study of neuromodulation, homeostasis, cellular and network variability, network development, and network recovery. The dissection of the stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) from the Jonah crab (Cancer borealis) is done in two parts; the gross and fine dissection. In the gross dissection the entire stomach is dissected from the crab. During the fine dissection the STNS is extracted from the stomach using a dissection microscope and micro-dissection tools (see figure 1). The STNS includes the STG, the oesophageal ganglion (OG), and the commissural ganglia (CoG) as well as the nerves that innervate the stomach muscles. Here, we show how to perform a complete dissection of the STNS in preparation for an electrophysiology experiment where the cells in the STG would be recorded from intracellularly and the peripheral nerves would be used for extracellular recordings. The proper technique for finding the desired nerves is shown as well as our technique of desheathing the ganglion to reveal the somata and neuropil.
1 Surgical resection of lung metastases: results from 529 patients. The aim of this study is to determine clinical, pathological, and treatment-relevant variables associated with long-term (90-month) overall survival in patients with lung metastases undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy. A retrospective review was performed of patients who were admitted with lung metastases, and who underwent thoracotomy for resection, after treatment of a primary tumor. Data were collected regarding demographics, tumor features, treatment, and outcome. Patients (n = 529) were submitted to a total of 776 thoracotomies. Median follow-up time across all patients was 21.6 months (range: 0-192 months). The postoperative complication rate was 9.3%, and the 30-day mortality rate was 0.2%. The ninety-month overall survival rate for all patients was 30.4%. Multivariate analysis identified the number of pulmonary nodules detected on preoperative CT-scan, the number of malignant nodules resected, and complete resection as the independent prognostic factors for overall survival. These results confirm that lung metastasectomy is a safe and potentially curative procedure for patients with treated primary tumors. A select group of patients can achieve long-term survival after resection.
2 Adding pioglitazone to insulin containing regimens in type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis. Type 2 diabetes is treated in a stepwise manner, progressing from diet and physical activity to oral antidiabetic agents and insulin. The oral agent pioglitazone is licensed for use with insulin when metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the extent to which adding pioglitazone to insulin-containing regimens produces benefits in terms of patient-relevant outcomes. Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing pioglitazone in combination with any insulin-containing regimen in comparison with the same insulin regimen alone in patients with type 2 diabetes. Outcomes investigated included HbA1c, hypoglycaemia, weight, and adverse events. Studies were selected, assessed and summarised according to standard systematic review methodology and in a meta-analysis. We included eight trials that examined the benefits of adding pioglitazone to an insulin regimen and studied a total of 3092 patients with type 2 diabetes. All studies included patients with previously inadequate glucose control. Trial duration was between 12 weeks and 34.5 months. The trials used pioglitazone doses of up to 45 mg/day. In our meta-analysis, the mean reduction in HbA1c was 0.58% (95% CI: -0.70, -0.46, p<0.00001). Hypoglycaemic episodes were slightly more frequent in the pioglitazone arms (relative risk 1.27; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.63, p = 0.06). Where reported, HDL-cholesterol tended to be increased with pioglitazone. Patients on pioglitazone tended to gain more weight than those who were not, with an average difference of almost 3 kg. Peripheral oedema was more frequent in the pioglitazone groups. None of the studies reported on fractures in women, and data on cardiovascular events were inconclusive, with most studies being too short or too small to assess these long-term outcomes. When added to insulin regimens, pioglitazone confers a small advantage in terms of HbA1c in type 2 diabetes patients with previous inadequate glucose control, but at the cost of increased hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Other considerations include the risk of heart failure, fractures in women, a reduced insulin dose, and the net financial cost.
1 Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cells expanded in vitro from lineage-traced adult human pancreatic beta cells. In-vitro expansion of functional beta cells from adult human islets is an attractive approach for generating an abundant source of cells for beta-cell replacement therapy of diabetes. Using genetic cell-lineage tracing we have recently shown that beta cells cultured from adult human islets undergo rapid dedifferentiation and proliferate for up to 16 population doublings. These cells have raised interest as potential candidates for redifferentiation into functional insulin-producing cells. Previous work has associated dedifferentiation of cultured epithelial cells with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and suggested that EMT generates cells with stem cell properties. Here we investigated the occurrence of EMT in these cultures and assessed their stem cell potential. Using cell-lineage tracing we provide direct evidence for occurrence of EMT in cells originating from beta cells in cultures of adult human islet cells. These cells express multiple mesenchymal markers, as well as markers associated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). However, we do not find evidence for the ability of such cells, nor of cells in these cultures derived from a non-beta-cell origin, to significantly differentiate into mesodermal cell types. These findings constitute the first demonstration based on genetic lineage-tracing of EMT in cultured adult primary human cells, and show that EMT does not induce multipotency in cells derived from human beta cells.
3 Effect of a supplement rich in alkaline minerals on acid-base balance in humans. Western diets are considered acidogenic due to the high dietary acid load and a low intake of base-forming dietary minerals such as potassium, magnesium or calcium. In the present study we investigated the effect of a multimineral supplement (MMS) rich in alkaline minerals on acute and chronic regulation of acid-base balance with the pH of blood, urine and saliva as potential surrogate markers. Parameters were measured (i) without MMS intake, (ii) in the three consecutive hours following ingestion (blood and urinary pH) and (iii) during one week with or without MMS intake (self-monitored using pH measurement strips). 25 (15 female; 10 male) subjects (age 44 +/- 14 y; BMI 23.9 +/- 1.9 kg/m2) were enrolled in the investigation. Following acute administration of the MMS in the morning, blood ph (1 and 2 h after ingestion) rose from 7.40 to 7.41; p < 0.05, and also urinary pH 3 h after ingestion (5.94 to 6.57; p < 0.05) increased significantly. Following longer-term supplementation, both the increase in urinary pH in the morning and in the evening occurred within 1 day. Compared to pH values without the MMS, average pH in urine was 11% higher in the morning and 5% higher in the evening. Analyses of food records showed that the increase in urinary pH was not related to dietary change. Our results suggest that the ingestion of a multimineral supplement is associated with both a significant increase in blood and urinary pH. The health related consequences of this supplementation remain to be determined.
0 Effects of cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP triple knockdown on prostate cancer cell susceptibility to apoptosis, cell survival and proliferation. Manipulating apoptotic resistance represents an important strategy for the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. We hypothesised that the Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) Proteins may be mediating this resistance and knockdown of cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP would increase sensitivity to apoptosis. cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP where knocked down either individually or in combination using siRNA in androgen independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells as confirmed by real-time PCR and western blotting. Cells were then treated with TRAIL, Etoposide, or Tunicamycin, and apoptosis assessed by PI DNA staining. Apoptosis was confirmed with Annexin V labelling and measurement of PARP cleavage, and was inhibited using the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD.fmk. Clonogenic assays and assessment of ID-1 expression by western blotting were used to measure recovery and proliferation. PC-3 are resistant to TRAIL induced apoptosis and have elevated expression of cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP. Combined knockdown sensitised PC-3 to TRAIL induced apoptosis, but not to Etoposide or Tunicmycin, with corresponding increases in caspase activity and PARP cleavage which was inhibited by ZVAD.fmk. Triple knock down decreased proliferation which was confirmed by decreased ID-1 expression. Simultaneous knock down of the IAPs not only sensitised the PC-3 to TRAIL but also inhibited their proliferation rates and clonogenic survival. The inability to alter sensitivity to other triggers of apoptosis suggests that this effect is specific for death receptor pathways and knock down might facilitate immune-surveillance mechanisms to counter cancer progression and, in combination with therapeutic approaches using TRAIL, could represent an important treatment strategy.
0 Group III secreted phospholipase A2 transgenic mice spontaneously develop inflammation. PLA2 (phospholipase A2) group III is an atypical sPLA2 (secretory PLA2) that is homologous with bee venom PLA2 rather than with other mammalian sPLA2s. In the present paper, we show that endogenous group III sPLA2 (PLA2G3) is expressed in mouse skin and that Tg (transgenic) mice overexpressing human PLA2G3 spontaneously develop skin inflammation. Pla2g3-Tg mice over 9 months of age frequently developed dermatitis with hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, parakeratosis, erosion, ulcer and sebaceous gland hyperplasia. The dermatitis was accompanied by infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages and by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and prostaglandin E2. In addition, Pla2g3-Tg mice had increased lymph aggregates and mucus in the airway, lymphocytic sialadenitis, hepatic extramedullary haemopoiesis, splenomegaly with increased populations of granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages, and increased serum IgG1. Collectively, these observations provide the first demonstration of spontaneous development of inflammation in mice with Tg overexpression of mammalian sPLA2.
3 Ku-0063794 is a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) stimulates cell growth by phosphorylating and promoting activation of AGC (protein kinase A/protein kinase G/protein kinase C) family kinases such as Akt (protein kinase B), S6K (p70 ribosomal S6 kinase) and SGK (serum and glucocorticoid protein kinase). mTORC1 (mTOR complex-1) phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6K, whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of Akt and SGK. In the present paper we describe the small molecule Ku-0063794, which inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with an IC50 of approximately 10 nM, but does not suppress the activity of 76 other protein kinases or seven lipid kinases, including Class 1 PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases) at 1000-fold higher concentrations. Ku-0063794 is cell permeant, suppresses activation and hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of Akt, S6K and SGK, but not RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase), an AGC kinase not regulated by mTOR. Ku-0063794 also inhibited phosphorylation of the T-loop Thr308 residue of Akt phosphorylated by PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1). We interpret this as implying phosphorylation of Ser473 promotes phosphorylation of Thr308 and/or induces a conformational change that protects Thr308 from dephosphorylation. In contrast, Ku-0063794 does not affect Thr308 phosphorylation in fibroblasts lacking essential mTORC2 subunits, suggesting that signalling processes have adapted to enable Thr308 phosphorylation to occur in the absence of Ser473 phosphorylation. We found that Ku-0063794 induced a much greater dephosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate 4E-BP1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1) than rapamycin, even in mTORC2-deficient cells, suggesting a form of mTOR distinct from mTORC1, or mTORC2 phosphorylates 4E-BP1. Ku-0063794 also suppressed cell growth and induced a G1-cell-cycle arrest. Our results indicate that Ku-0063794 will be useful in delineating the physiological roles of mTOR and may have utility in treatment of cancers in which this pathway is inappropriately activated.
3 Mining biological pathways using WikiPathways web services. WikiPathways is a platform for creating, updating, and sharing biological pathways [1]. Pathways can be edited and downloaded using the wiki-style website. Here we present a SOAP web service that provides programmatic access to WikiPathways that is complementary to the website. We describe the functionality that this web service offers and discuss several use cases in detail. Exposing WikiPathways through a web service opens up new ways of utilizing pathway information and assisting the community curation process.
1 Ozone and cardiovascular injury. Air pollution is increasingly recognized as an important and modifiable determinant of cardiovascular diseases in urban communities. The potential detrimental effects are both acute and chronic having a strong impact on morbidity and mortality. The acute exposure to pollutants has been linked to adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias. The long-terms effects are related to the lifetime risk of death from cardiac causes. The WHO estimates that air pollution is responsible for 3 million premature deaths each year. The evidence supporting these data is very strong nonetheless, epidemiologic and observational data have the main limitation of imprecise measurements. Moreover, the lack of clinical experimental models makes it difficult to demonstrate the individual risk. The other limitation is related to the lack of a clear mechanism explaining the effects of pollution on cardiovascular mortality. In the present review we will explore the epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence of the effects of ozone on cardiovascular diseases. The pathophysiologic consequences of air pollutant exposures have been extensively investigated in pulmonary systems, and it is clear that some of the major components of air pollution (e.g. ozone and particulate matter) can initiate and exacerbate lung disease in humans 1. It is possible that pulmonary oxidant stress mediated by particulate matter and/or ozone (O3) exposure can result in downstream perturbations in the cardiovasculature, as the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems are intricately associated, and it is well documented that specific environmental toxins (such as tobacco smoke 2) introduced through the lungs can initiate and/or accelerate cardiovascular disease development. Indeed, several epidemiologic studies have proved that there is an association between PM and O3 and the increased incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 3. Most of the evidence comes from studies of ambient particles concentrations. However, in Europe and elsewhere, the air pollution profile has gradually changed toward a more pronounced photochemical component. Ozone is one of the most toxic components of the photochemical air pollution mixture. Indeed, the biological basis for these observations has not been elucidated. In the present review, the role of ozone as chemical molecule will be firstly considered. Secondly, pathogenetic mechanisms connecting the atmospheric ozone level and cardiovascular pathology will be examined. Thirdly, the literature relating hospitalization frequency, morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular causes and ozone concentration will be studied. The correlation between ozone level and occurrence of acute myocardial infarction will be eventually discussed.
0 In vitro nuclear interactome of the HIV-1 Tat protein. One facet of the complexity underlying the biology of HIV-1 resides not only in its limited number of viral proteins, but in the extensive repertoire of cellular proteins they interact with and their higher-order assembly. HIV-1 encodes the regulatory protein Tat (86-101aa), which is essential for HIV-1 replication and primarily orchestrates HIV-1 provirus transcriptional regulation. Previous studies have demonstrated that Tat function is highly dependent on specific interactions with a range of cellular proteins. However they can only partially account for the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamics of proviral gene expression. To obtain a comprehensive nuclear interaction map of Tat in T-cells, we have designed a proteomic strategy based on affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Our approach resulted in the identification of a total of 183 candidates as Tat nuclear partners, 90% of which have not been previously characterised. Subsequently we applied in silico analysis, to validate and characterise our dataset which revealed that the Tat nuclear interactome exhibits unique signature(s). First, motif composition analysis highlighted that our dataset is enriched for domains mediating protein, RNA and DNA interactions, and helicase and ATPase activities. Secondly, functional classification and network reconstruction clearly depicted Tat as a polyvalent protein adaptor and positioned Tat at the nexus of a densely interconnected interaction network involved in a range of biological processes which included gene expression regulation, RNA biogenesis, chromatin structure, chromosome organisation, DNA replication and nuclear architecture. We have completed the in vitro Tat nuclear interactome and have highlighted its modular network properties and particularly those involved in the coordination of gene expression by Tat. Ultimately, the highly specialised set of molecular interactions identified will provide a framework to further advance our understanding of the mechanisms of HIV-1 proviral gene silencing and activation.
0 The HaDREB2 transcription factor enhances basal thermotolerance and longevity of seeds through functional interaction with HaHSFA9. Transcription factor HaDREB2 was identified in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) as a drought-responsive element-binding factor 2 (DREB2) with unique properties. HaDREB2 and the sunflower Heat Shock Factor A9 (HaHSFA9) co-activated the Hahsp17.6G1 promoter in sunflower embryos. Both factors could be involved in transcriptional co-activation of additional small heat stress protein (sHSP) promoters, and thus contribute to the HaHSFA9-mediated enhancement of longevity and basal thermotolerance of seeds. We found that overexpression of HaDREB2 in seeds did not enhance longevity. This was deduced from assays of basal thermotolerance and controlled seed-deterioration, which were performed with transgenic tobacco. Furthermore, the constitutive overexpression of HaDREB2 did not increase thermotolerance in seedlings or result in the accumulation of HSPs at normal growth temperatures. In contrast, when HaDREB2 and HaHSFA9 were conjointly overexpressed in seeds, we observed positive effects on seed longevity, beyond those observed with overexpression of HaHSFA9 alone. Such additional effects are accompanied by a subtle enhancement of the accumulation of subsets of sHSPs belonging to the CI and CII cytosolic classes. Our results reveal the functional interdependency of HaDREB2 and HaHSFA9 in seeds. HaDREB2 differs from other previously characterized DREB2 factors in plants in terms of its unique functional interaction with the seed-specific HaHSFA9 factor. No functional interaction between HaDREB2 and HaHSFA9 was observed when both factors were conjointly overexpressed in vegetative tissues. We therefore suggest that additional, seed-specific factors, or protein modifications, could be required for the functional interaction between HaDREB2 and HaHSFA9.
0 Acromegaly and gigantism in the medical literature. Case descriptions in the era before and the early years after the initial publication of Pierre Marie (1886). In 1886 Pierre Marie used the term "acromegaly" for the first time and gave a full description of the characteristic clinical picture. However several others had already given clear clinical descriptions before him and sometimes had given the disease other names. After 1886, it gradually became clear that pituitary enlargement (caused by a pituitary adenoma) was the cause and not the consequence of acromegaly, as initially thought. Pituitary adenomas could be found in the great majority of cases. It also became clear that acromegaly and gigantism were the same disease but occurring at different stages of life and not different diseases as initially thought. At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century most information was derived from case descriptions and post-mortem examinations of patients with acromegaly or (famous) patients with gigantism. The stage was set for further research into the pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy of acromegaly and gigantism.
0 Scaling up stigma? The effects of antiretroviral roll-out on stigma and HIV testing. Early evidence from rural Tanzania. To investigate the interplay between antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up, different types of stigma and Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) uptake 2 years after the introduction of free ART in a rural ward of Tanzania. Qualitative study using in-depth interviews and group activities with a purposive sample of 91 community leaders, 77 ART clients and 16 health providers. Data were analysed for recurrent themes using NVIVO-7 software. The complex interplay between ART, stigma and VCT in this setting is characterised by two powerful but opposing dynamics. The availability of effective treatment has transformed HIV into a manageable condition which is contributing to a reduction in self-stigma and is stimulating VCT uptake. However, this is counterbalanced by the persistence of blaming attitudes and emergence of new sources of stigma associated with ART provision. The general perception among community leaders was that as ART users regained health, they increasingly engaged in sexual relations and "spread the disease." Fears were exacerbated because they were perceived to be very mobile and difficult to identify physically. Some leaders suggested giving ART recipients drugs "for impotence," marking them "with a sign" and putting them "in isolation camps." In this context, traditional beliefs about disease aetiology provided a less stigmatised explanation for HIV symptoms contributing to a situation of collective denial. Where anticipated stigma prevails, provision of antiretroviral drugs alone is unlikely to have sufficient impact on VCT uptake. Achieving widespread public health benefits of ART roll-out requires community-level interventions to ensure local acceptability of antiretroviral drugs.
2 Air pollution and emergency department visits for cardiac and respiratory conditions: a multi-city time-series analysis. Relatively few studies have been conducted of the association between air pollution and emergency department (ED) visits, and most of these have been based on a small number of visits, for a limited number of health conditions and pollutants, and only daily measures of exposure and response. A time-series analysis was conducted on nearly 400,000 ED visits to 14 hospitals in seven Canadian cities during the 1990 s and early 2000s. Associations were examined between carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM2.5), and visits for angina/myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmia/conduction disturbance, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory infections. Daily and 3-hourly visit counts were modeled as quasi-Poisson and analyses controlled for effects of temporal cycles, weather, day of week and holidays. 24-hour average concentrations of CO and NO2 lag 0 days exhibited the most consistent associations with cardiac conditions (2.1% (95% CI, 0.0-4.2%) and 2.6% (95% CI, 0.2-5.0%) increase in visits for myocardial infarction/angina per 0.7 ppm CO and 18.4 ppb NO2 respectively; 3.8% (95% CI, 0.7-6.9%) and 4.7% (95% CI, 1.2-8.4%) increase in visits for heart failure). Ozone (lag 2 days) was most consistently associated with respiratory visits (3.2% (95% CI, 0.3-6.2%), and 3.7% (95% CI, -0.5-7.9%) increases in asthma and COPD visits respectively per 18.4 ppb). Associations tended to be of greater magnitude during the warm season (April - September). In particular, the associations of PM 10 and PM2.5 with asthma visits were respectively nearly three- and over fourfold larger vs. all year analyses (14.4% increase in visits, 95% CI, 0.2-30.7, per 20.6 microg/m3 PM 10 and 7.6% increase in visits, 95% CI, 5.1-10.1, per 8.2 microg/m3 PM2.5). No consistent associations were observed between three hour average pollutant concentrations and same-day three hour averages of ED visits. In this large multicenter analysis, daily average concentrations of CO and NO2 exhibited the most consistent associations with ED visits for cardiac conditions, while ozone exhibited the most consistent associations with visits for respiratory conditions. PM 10 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with asthma visits during the warm season.
1 A description of the structural determination procedures of a gap junction channel at 3.5 A resolution. Intercellular signalling is an essential characteristic of multicellular organisms. Gap junctions, which consist of arrays of intercellular channels, permit the exchange of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. Here, the structural determination of a gap junction channel composed of connexin 26 (Cx26) at 3.5 A resolution is described. During each step of the purification process, the protein was examined using electron microscopy and/or dynamic light scattering. Dehydration of the crystals improved the resolution limits. Phase refinement using multi-crystal averaging in conjunction with noncrystallographic symmetry averaging based on strictly determined noncrystallographic symmetry operators resulted in an electron-density map for model building. The amino-acid sequence of a protomer structure consisting of the amino-terminal helix, four transmembrane helices and two extracellular loops was assigned to the electron-density map. The amino-acid assignment was confirmed using six selenomethionine (SeMet) sites in the difference Fourier map of the SeMet derivative and three intramolecular disulfide bonds in the anomalous difference Fourier map of the native crystal.
0 Mapping of loci from Solanum lycopersicoides conferring resistance or susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea in tomato. Cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum, syn. Lycopersicon esculentum) is susceptible to the necrotrophic ascomycete and causal agent of gray mold, Botrytis cinerea. Resistance to this fungal pathogen is elevated in wild relatives of tomato, including Solanum lycopersicoides. An introgression line population (IL) containing chromosomal segments of S. lycopersicoides within the background of tomato cv. VF36 was used to screen the genome for foliar resistance and susceptibility to B. cinerea. Based on this screen, putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified, five for resistance and two for susceptibility. Four resistance QTL decreased infection frequency while the fifth reduced lesion diameter. One susceptibility QTL increased infection frequency whereas the other increased lesion diameter. Overlapping chromosomal segments provided strong evidence for partial resistance on chromosomes 1 and 9 and for elevated susceptibility on chromosome 11. Segregation analysis confirmed the major resistance QTL on the long arm of chromosome 1 and susceptibility on chromosome 11. Linkage of partial resistance to chromosome 9 could not be confirmed. The usefulness of these data for resistance breeding and for map-based cloning of foliar resistance to B. cinerea is discussed.
1 History of Lipizzan horse maternal lines as revealed by mtDNA analysis. Sequencing of the mtDNA control region (385 or 695 bp) of 212 Lipizzans from eight studs revealed 37 haplotypes. Distribution of haplotypes among studs was biased, including many private haplotypes but only one haplotype was present in all the studs. According to historical data, numerous Lipizzan maternal lines originating from founder mares of different breeds have been established during the breed's history, so the broad genetic base of the Lipizzan maternal lines was expected. A comparison of Lipizzan sequences with 136 sequences of domestic- and wild-horses from GenBank showed a clustering of Lipizzan haplotypes in the majority of haplotype subgroups present in other domestic horses. We assume that haplotypes identical to haplotypes of early domesticated horses can be found in several Lipizzan maternal lines as well as in other breeds. Therefore, domestic horses could arise either from a single large population or from several populations provided there were strong migrations during the early phase after domestication. A comparison of Lipizzan haplotypes with 56 maternal lines (according to the pedigrees) showed a disagreement of biological parentage with pedigree data for at least 11% of the Lipizzans. A distribution of haplotype-frequencies was unequal (0.2%-26%), mainly due to pedigree errors and haplotype sharing among founder mares.
1 Fast benchtop fabrication of laminar flow chambers for advanced microscopy techniques. Fluid handling technology is acquiring an ever more prominent place in laboratory science whether it is in simple buffer exchange systems, perfusion chambers, or advanced microfluidic devices. Many of these applications remain the providence of laboratories at large institutions with a great deal of expertise and specialized equipment. Even with the expansion of these techniques, limitations remain that frequently prevent the coupling of controlled fluid flow with other technologies, such as coupling microfluidics and high-resolution position and force measurements by optical trapping microscopy. Here we present a method for fabrication of multiple-input laminar flow devices that are optically clear [glass] on each face, chemically inert, reusable, inexpensive, and can be fabricated on the benchtop in approximately one hour. Further these devices are designed to allow flow regulation by a simple gravity method thus requiring no specialized equipment to drive flow. Here we use these devices to perform total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy measurements as well as position sensitive optical trapping experiments. Flow chamber technology needs to be more accessible to the general scientific community. The method presented here is versatile and robust. These devices use standard slides and coverslips making them compatible with nearly all types and models of light microscopes. These devices meet the needs of groups doing advanced optical trapping experiments, but could also be adapted by nearly any lab that has a function for solution flow coupled with microscopy.
1 Comparison between measurements obtained with three different perineometers. To analyze the results obtained in the evaluation of intra-vaginal pressure using three different brands of perineometers in nulliparous volunteers. Twenty nulliparous women with no anatomical alterations and/or dysfunction of the pelvic floor were enrolled in our study. All the women had the ability to voluntarily contract their PFM (Pelvic Floor Muscles), as assessed by digital palpation. The intra-vaginal pressure was assessed using three different brands of perineometer (Neurodyn Evolution, SensuPower and Peritron). Each volunteer was evaluated on three alternate days by a single examiner using a single brand of perineometer on each day. In the assessment, the volunteers were required to pull (contract) their PFM in and up as strongly as possible 3 times and to sustain the contraction for 5 seconds, with an interval of 30 seconds between each pull. For the statistical analysis, a concordance correlation coefficient was used to compare the values that were obtained with each brand of perineometer. A moderate concordance (0.51) was found between the results from the Peritron and Neurodyn perineometers, a fair concordance (0.21) between the Peritron and SensuPower brands and a poor concordance (0.19) between the Neurodyn and SensuPower brands. The concordance of the measurements of the intra-vaginal pressure ranged from poor to moderate, suggesting that perineometers of different brands generate different results.
2 Laparoscopic completely extraperitoneal repair of inguinal hernia in children: a single-institute experience with 1,257 repairs compared with cut-down herniorrhaphy. Conventional open herniorrhaphy in children has been reported to have 0.3-3.8% recurrence and 5.6-30% postoperative contralateral hernia rates. We developed a unique technique to achieve completely extraperitoneal ligation of PPV without any skip areas under laparoscopic control. This report introduces our technique and results compared with the cut-down herniorrhaphy. A consecutive series of 1,585 children with inguinal hernia/hydrocele (1996-2006) was analyzed. In laparoscopic patent processus vaginalis (PPV) closure (LPC), an orifice of PPV was encircled with a 2-0 suture extraperitoneally by a specially devised Endoneedle and tied up from outside of the body achieving completely extraperitoneal ligation of the ring. The round ligament was included in the ligation, whereas the spermatic cord and testicular vessels were excluded by advancing the needle across them behind the peritoneum. Cut-down herniorrhaphy (CD), with or without diagnostic laparoscopy, or LPC was selected according to parental preference under informed consent. Parents gave more preference to LPC (LPC in 1,257 children, CD in 308, and miscellaneous in 20). Age ranges were equal for both groups. Sex distribution showed female preponderance in the LPC group (44.8% vs. 26.6%, p < 0.001) and umbilical hernia/cysts were predominantly included in the LPC group (11.9% vs. 2.9%, p < 0.001). Mean operation times were equal for both groups for unilateral repair (28.2 +/- 9.2 for LPC vs. 27.8 +/- 13.5 for CD) and were shorter for bilateral repair in the LPC group (35.8 +/- 11.6 vs. 46.7 +/- 17.7). The incidence of postoperative hernia recurrence and contralateral hernia in the LPC group was 0.2% and 0.8%. Two children in the CD group had injuries to their reproductive system during the operation (0.6%). The advantages of our technique include following: technically simple, short operation time, inspection of bilateral IIRs with simultaneous closure of cPPV, reproductive systems remain intact, routine addition of umbilicoplasty if desired, and essentially indiscernible wounds.
0 Guarding the gateway to cortex with attention in visual thalamus. The massive visual input from the eye to the brain requires selective processing of some visual information at the expense of other information, a process referred to as visual attention. Increases in the responses of visual neurons with attention have been extensively studied along the visual processing streams in monkey cerebral cortex, from primary visual areas to parietal and frontal cortex. Here we show, by recording neurons in attending macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), that attention modulates visual signals before they even reach cortex by increasing responses of both magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the first relay between retina and cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). At the same time, attention decreases neuronal responses in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Crick argued for such modulation of the LGN by observing that it is inhibited by the TRN, and suggested that "if the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, the reticular complex might be described as the guardian of the gateway", a reciprocal relationship we now show to be more than just hypothesis. The reciprocal modulation in LGN and TRN appears only during the initial visual response, but the modulation of LGN reappears later in the response, suggesting separate early and late sources of attentional modulation in LGN.
3 Campylobacter infection of broiler chickens in a free-range environment. Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, with contaminated chicken meat considered to represent a major source of human infection. Biosecurity measures can reduce C. jejuni shedding rates of housed chickens, but the increasing popularity of free-range and organic meat raises the question of whether the welfare benefits of extensive production are compatible with food safety. The widespread assumption that the free-range environment contaminates extensively reared chickens has not been rigorously tested. A year-long survey of 64 free-range broiler flocks reared on two sites in Oxfordshire, UK, combining high-resolution genotyping with behavioural and environmental observations revealed: (i) no evidence of colonization of succeeding flocks by the C. jejuni genotypes shed by preceding flocks, (ii) a high degree of similarity between C. jejuni genotypes from both farm sites, (iii) no association of ranging behaviour with likelihood of Campylobacter shedding, and (iv) higher genetic differentiation between C. jejuni populations from chickens and wild birds on the same farm than between the chicken samples, human disease isolates from the same region and national samples of C. jejuni from chicken meat.
3 Pattern of smoking habit among Greek blue and white collar workers. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of smoking in a Greek working population. A questionnaire regarding smoking habit was collected from 1,005 out of 1,200 blue and white-collar employees (response rate: 84%). The overall smoking prevalence was 48.4% and did not differ by sex, age, education, and occupation. The mean cigarette consumption per day was 25.54, with no difference observed by occupation. The above-mentioned findings, if confirmed by further research, are alarming and inconsistent with the prevalent pattern of smoking habits in the West.
0 Genomewide linkage scan of schizophrenia in a large multicenter pedigree sample using single nucleotide polymorphisms. A genomewide linkage scan was carried out in eight clinical samples of informative schizophrenia families. After all quality control checks, the analysis of 707 European-ancestry families included 1615 affected and 1602 unaffected genotyped individuals, and the analysis of all 807 families included 1900 affected and 1839 unaffected individuals. Multipoint linkage analysis with correction for marker-marker linkage disequilibrium was carried out with 5861 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Illumina version 4.0 linkage map). Suggestive evidence for linkage (European families) was observed on chromosomes 8p21, 8q24.1, 9q34 and 12q24.1 in nonparametric and/or parametric analyses. In a logistic regression allele-sharing analysis of linkage allowing for intersite heterogeneity, genomewide significant evidence for linkage was observed on chromosome 10p12. Significant heterogeneity was also observed on chromosome 22q11.1. Evidence for linkage across family sets and analyses was most consistent on chromosome 8p21, with a one-LOD support interval that does not include the candidate gene NRG1, suggesting that one or more other susceptibility loci might exist in the region. In this era of genomewide association and deep resequencing studies, consensus linkage regions deserve continued attention, given that linkage signals can be produced by many types of genomic variation, including any combination of multiple common or rare SNPs or copy number variants in a region.
0 The structural and functional coupling of two molecular machines, the ribosome and the translocon. Ribosomes synthesizing secretory and membrane proteins are bound to translocons at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Both the ribosome and translocon are complex macromolecular machines whose structural and functional interactions are poorly understood. A new study by Pool (Pool, M.R. 2009. J. Cell Biol. 185:889-902) has now shown that the structure of the translocon is dictated by the identity of the protein being synthesized by the ribosome, thereby demonstrating that the two macromolecular machines are structurally coupled for functional purposes. The study also identifies an unexpected component in the apparent molecular linkage that connects the two machines, a discovery that shows the current view of translocon structure is oversimplified.
0 Mutations in many genes affect aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Aggressive behavior in animals is important for survival and reproduction. Identifying the underlying genes and environmental contexts that affect aggressive behavior is important for understanding the evolutionary forces that maintain variation for aggressive behavior in natural populations, and to develop therapeutic interventions to modulate extreme levels of aggressive behavior in humans. While the role of neurotransmitters and a few other molecules in mediating and modulating levels of aggression is well established, it is likely that many additional genetic pathways remain undiscovered. Drosophila melanogaster has recently been established as an excellent model organism for studying the genetic basis of aggressive behavior. Here, we present the results of a screen of 170 Drosophila P-element insertional mutations for quantitative differences in aggressive behavior from their co-isogenic control line. We identified 59 mutations in 57 genes that affect aggressive behavior, none of which had been previously implicated to affect aggression. Thirty-two of these mutants exhibited increased aggression, while 27 lines were less aggressive than the control. Many of the genes affect the development and function of the nervous system, and are thus plausibly relevant to the execution of complex behaviors. Others affect basic cellular and metabolic processes, or are mutations in computationally predicted genes for which aggressive behavior is the first biological annotation. Most of the mutations had pleiotropic effects on other complex traits. We characterized nine of these mutations in greater detail by assessing transcript levels throughout development, morphological changes in the mushroom bodies, and restoration of control levels of aggression in revertant alleles. All of the P-element insertions affected the tagged genes, and had pleiotropic effects on brain morphology. This study reveals that many more genes than previously suspected affect aggressive behavior, and that these genes have widespread pleiotropic effects. Given the conservation of aggressive behavior among different animal species, these are novel candidate genes for future study in other animals, including humans.
3 Comparative assessment of substrates and activity based probes as tools for non-invasive optical imaging of cysteine protease activity. Recent advances in the field of non-invasive optical imaging have included the development of contrast agents that report on the activity of enzymatic targets associated with disease pathology. In particular, proteases have proven to be ideal targets for development of optical sensors for cancer. Recently developed contrast agents for protease activity include both small peptides and large polymer-based quenched fluorescent substrates as well as fluorescently labeled activity based probes (ABPs). While substrates produce a fluorescent signal as a result of processing by a protease, ABPs are retained at the site of proteolysis due to formation of a permanent covalent bond with the active site catalytic residue. Both methods have potential advantages and disadvantages yet a careful comparison of substrates and ABPs has not been performed. Here we present the results of a direct comparison of commercially available protease substrates with several recently described fluorescent ABPs in a mouse model of cancer. The results demonstrate that fluorescent ABPs show more rapid and selective uptake into tumors as well as overall brighter signals compared to substrate probes. These data suggest that the lack of signal amplification for an ABP is offset by the increased kinetics of tissue uptake and prolonged retention of the probes once bound to a protease target. Furthermore, fluorescent ABPs can be used as imaging reagents with similar or better results as the commercially available protease substrates.
0 Global phenotypic characterization of bacteria. The measure of the quality of a systems biology model is how well it can reproduce and predict the behaviors of a biological system such as a microbial cell. In recent years, these models have been built up in layers, and each layer has been growing in sophistication and accuracy in parallel with a global data set to challenge and validate the models in predicting the content or activities of genes (genomics), proteins (proteomics), metabolites (metabolomics), and ultimately cell phenotypes (phenomics). This review focuses on the latter, the phenotypes of microbial cells. The development of Phenotype MicroArrays, which attempt to give a global view of cellular phenotypes, is described. In addition to their use in fleshing out and validating systems biology models, there are many other uses of this global phenotyping technology in basic and applied microbiology research, which are also described.
1 Investigating the missing data mechanism in quality of life outcomes: a comparison of approaches. Missing data is classified as missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). Knowing the mechanism is useful in identifying the most appropriate analysis. The first aim was to compare different methods for identifying this missing data mechanism to determine if they gave consistent conclusions. Secondly, to investigate whether the reminder-response data can be utilised to help identify the missing data mechanism. Five clinical trial datasets that employed a reminder system at follow-up were used. Some quality of life questionnaires were initially missing, but later recovered through reminders. Four methods of determining the missing data mechanism were applied. Two response data scenarios were considered. Firstly, immediate data only; secondly, all observed responses (including reminder-response). In three of five trials the hypothesis tests found evidence against the MCAR assumption. Logistic regression suggested MAR, but was able to use the reminder-collected data to highlight potential MNAR data in two trials. The four methods were consistent in determining the missingness mechanism. One hypothesis test was preferred as it is applicable with intermittent missingness. Some inconsistencies between the two data scenarios were found. Ignoring the reminder data could potentially give a distorted view of the missingness mechanism. Utilising reminder data allowed the possibility of MNAR to be considered.
0 Hypoxia upregulates angiogenesis and synovial cell migration in rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by invasion of cartilage, bone and tendon by inflamed synovium. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that hypoxia is a feature of RA synovitis. In the present study, we investigated the consequences of hypoxia on angiogenesis and synovial fibroblast migration in RA. Synovial tissue was harvested from RA patients, and synovial membrane cells were cultured under conditions either of hypoxia (1% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen). Protein levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and angiogenic factors were measured, while RNA was extracted for PCR quantification of MMPs/tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs) and angiogenic factors. Migration of RA synovial fibroblasts through collagen, and the effect of RA synovial cell supernatants in an in vitro angiogenesis assay, were utilised to determine the functional relevance of changes in mRNA/protein. We observed upregulation under hypoxic conditions of MMPs responsible for collagen breakdown, specifically collagenase MMP-8, and the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, at both mRNA and protein levels. Increased MT1-MMP mRNA was also observed, but no effect on TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 was detected. RA fibroblast migration across collagen was significantly increased under hypoxic conditions, and was dependent on MMP activity. Furthermore, expression of angiogenic stimuli, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF/placental growth factor heterodimer, was also increased. Crucially, we show for the first time that hypoxia increased the angiogenic drive of RA cells, as demonstrated by enhanced blood vessel formation in an in vitro angiogenesis assay. Hypoxia may be responsible for rendering RA synovial lining proangiogenic and proinvasive, thus leading to the debilitating features characteristic of RA.
2 Antiretroviral effect of lovastatin on HIV-1-infected individuals without highly active antiretroviral therapy (The LIVE study): a phase-II randomized clinical trial. Highly active antiretroviral therapy produces a significant decrease in HIV-1 replication and allows an increase in the CD4 T-cell count, leading to a decrease in the incidence of opportunistic infections and mortality. However, the cost, side effects and complexity of antiretroviral regimens have underscored the immediate need for additional therapeutic approaches. Statins exert pleiotropic effects through a variety of mechanisms, among which there are several immunoregulatory effects, related and unrelated to their cholesterol-lowering activity that can be useful to control HIV-1 infection. Randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, single-center, phase-II clinical trial. One hundred and ten chronically HIV-1-infected patients, older than 18 years and naïve for antiretroviral therapy (i.e., without prior or current management with antiretroviral drugs) will be enrolled at the outpatient services from the most important centres for health insurance care in Medellin-Colombia. The interventions will be lovastatin (40 mg/day, orally, for 12 months; 55 patients) or placebo (55 patients). Our primary aim will be to determine the effect of lovastatin on viral replication. The secondary aim will be to determine the effect of lovastatin on CD4+ T-cell count in peripheral blood. As tertiary aims we will explore differences in CD8+ T-cell count, expression of activation markers (CD38 and HLA-DR) on CD4 and CD8 T cells, cholesterol metabolism, LFA-1/ICAM-1 function, Rho GTPases function and clinical evolution between treated and not treated HIV-1-infected individuals. Preliminary descriptive studies have suggested that statins (lovastatin) may have anti HIV-1 activity and that their administration is safe, with the potential effect of controlling HIV-1 replication in chronically infected individuals who had not received antiretroviral medications. Considering that there is limited clinical data available on this topic, all these findings warrant further evaluation to determine if long-term administration of statins may benefit the virological and immunological evolution in HIV-1-infected individuals before the use of antiretroviral therapy is required. Registration number NCT00721305.
0 Wood density and its radial variation in six canopy tree species differing in shade-tolerance in western Thailand. Wood density is a key variable for understanding life history strategies in tropical trees. Differences in wood density and its radial variation were related to the shade-tolerance of six canopy tree species in seasonally dry tropical forest in Thailand. In addition, using tree ring measurements, the influence of tree size, age and annual increment on radial density gradients was analysed. Wood density was determined from tree cores using X-ray densitometry. X-ray films were digitized and images were measured, resulting in a continuous density profile for each sample. Mixed models were then developed to analyse differences in average wood density and in radial gradients in density among the six tree species, as well as the effects of tree age, size and annual increment on radial increases in Melia azedarach. Average wood density generally reflected differences in shade-tolerance, varying by nearly a factor of two. Radial gradients occurred in all species, ranging from an increase of (approx. 70%) in the shade-intolerant Melia azedarach to a decrease of approx. 13% in the shade-tolerant Neolitsea obtusifolia, but the slopes of radial gradients were generally unrelated to shade-tolerance. For Melia azedarach, radial increases were most-parsimoniously explained by log-transformed tree age and annual increment rather than by tree size. The results indicate that average wood density generally reflects differences in shade-tolerance in seasonally dry tropical forests; however, inferences based on wood density alone are potentially misleading for species with complex life histories. In addition, the findings suggest that a 'whole-tree' view of life history and biomechanics is important for understanding patterns of radial variation in wood density. Finally, accounting for wood density gradients is likely to improve the accuracy of estimates of stem biomass and carbon in tropical trees.
1 Common variants at ten loci influence QT interval duration in the QTGEN Study. QT interval duration, reflecting myocardial repolarization on the electrocardiogram, is a heritable risk factor for sudden cardiac death and drug-induced arrhythmias. We conducted a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies in 13,685 individuals of European ancestry from the Framingham Heart Study, the Rotterdam Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study, as part of the QTGEN consortium. We observed associations at P < 5 x 10(-8) with variants in NOS1AP, KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNH2 and SCN5A, known to be involved in myocardial repolarization and mendelian long-QT syndromes. Associations were found at five newly identified loci, including 16q21 near NDRG4 and GINS3, 6q22 near PLN, 1p36 near RNF207, 16p13 near LITAF and 17q12 near LIG3 and RFFL. Collectively, the 14 independent variants at these 10 loci explain 5.4-6.5% of the variation in QT interval. These results, together with an accompanying paper, offer insights into myocardial repolarization and suggest candidate genes that could predispose to sudden cardiac death and drug-induced arrhythmias.
1 Anatomy of a wrong diagnosis: false sinus venosus atrial septal defect. In contrast with transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography provides a sure way to make the diagnosis of sinus venosus atrial septal defect; on the other hand this abnormality is more complex than that seen with the secundum atrial septal defect, and inexperienced operators may fail to recognize properly the defect. In front of a high reported sensitivity using transesophageal echocardiography, specificity is difficult to assess, due to possible underreporting of diagnostic errors. We describe a false positive diagnosis of sinus venosus atrial septal defect, in the setting of enlarged right chambers of the heart because of pressure overload. Modified anatomy of the heart, together with the presence of a prominent linear structure(probably Eustachian Valve) and an incomplete examination in this case made image interpretation very prone to misinterpretation. In this anatomical setting transesophageal longitudinal "bicaval" view may be sub-optimal for examining the atrial septum, potentially showing false images that need to be known for correct image interpretation. Nonetheless, a scan plane taken more accurately at the superior level would have demonstrated/excluded the pathognomonic feature of sinus venosus atrial septal defect in the high atrial septum, between the fatty limbus and the inferior aspect of the right pulmonary artery; moreover TEE allows morphological information about the posterior structures of the heart that need to be investigated in detail for a complete diagnosis.
0 Introgression of apomixis into sexual species is inhibited by mentor effects and ploidy barriers in the Ranunculus auricomus complex. Apomictic plants maintain functional pollen, and via pollination the genetic factors controlling apomixis can be potentially transferred to congeneric sexual populations. In contrast, the sexual individuals do not fertilize apomictic plants which produce seeds without fertilization of the egg cells. This unidirectional introgressive hybridization is expected finally to replace sexuality by apomixis and is thought to be a causal factor for the wide geographical distribution of apomictic complexes. Nevertheless, this process may be inhibited by induced selfing (mentor effects) of otherwise self-incompatible sexual individuals. Here whether mentor effects or actual cross-fertilization takes place between diploid sexual and polyploid apomictic cytotypes in the Ranunculus auricomus complex was tested via experimental crosses. Diploid sexual mother plants were pollinated with tetra- and hexaploid apomictic pollen donators by hand, and the amount of well-developed seed compared with aborted seed was evaluated. The reproductive pathways were assessed in the well-developed seed via flow cytometric seed screen (FCSS). The majority of seed was aborted; the well-developed seeds have resulted from both mentor effects and cross-fertilization at very low frequencies (1.3 and 1.6 % of achenes, respectively). Pollination by 4x apomictic pollen plants results more frequently in cross-fertilization, whereas pollen from 6x plants more frequently induced mentor effects. It is concluded that introgression of apomixis into sexual populations is limited by ploidy barriers in the R. auricomus complex, and to a minor extent by mentor effects. In mixed populations, sexuality cannot be replaced by apomixis because the higher fertility of sexual populations still compensates the low frequencies of potential introgression of apomixis.
3 The effect of continuous glucose monitoring in well-controlled type 1 diabetes. OBJECTIVE The potential benefits of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the management of adults and children with well-controlled type 1 diabetes have not been examined. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 129 adults and children with intensively treated type 1 diabetes (age range 8-69 years) and A1C <7.0% were randomly assigned to either continuous or standard glucose monitoring for 26 weeks. The main study outcomes were time with glucose level < or =70 mg/dl, A1C level, and severe hypoglycemic events. RESULTS At 26 weeks, biochemical hypoglycemia (< or =70 mg/dl) was less frequent in the CGM group than in the control group (median 54 vs. 91 min/day), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.16). Median time with a glucose level < or =60 mg/dl was 18 versus 35 min/day, respectively (P = 0.05). Time out of range (< or =70 or >180 mg/dl) was significantly lower in the CGM group than in the control group (377 vs. 491 min/day, P = 0.003). There was a significant treatment group difference favoring the CGM group in mean A1C at 26 weeks adjusted for baseline (P < 0.001). One or more severe hypoglycemic events occurred in 10 and 11% of the two groups, respectively (P = 1.0). Four outcome measures combining A1C and hypoglycemia data favored the CGM group in comparison with the control group (P < 0.001, 0.007, 0.005, and 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Most outcomes, including those combining A1C and hypoglycemia, favored the CGM group. The weight of evidence suggests that CGM is beneficial for individuals with type 1 diabetes who have already achieved excellent control with A1C <7.0%.
1 Levels of C-reactive protein associated with high and very high cardiovascular risk are prevalent in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels>3 mg/L and>10 mg/L are associated with high and very high cardiovascular risk, respectively, in the general population. Because rheumatoid arthritis (RA) confers excess cardiovascular mortality, we determined the prevalence of these CRP levels among RA patients stratified on the basis of their RA disease activity. We evaluated physician and patient global assessments of disease activity, tender and swollen 28 joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and CRP measured in a single clinic visit for 151 RA patients. Disease activity was calculated using the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Disease Activity Score 28 Joints (DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP). Median CRP level was 5.3 mg/L. 68% of patients had CRP>3 mg/L, and 25% had CRP>10 mg/L. Of those with 0-1 swollen joints (n = 56), or 0-1 tender joints (n = 81), 64% and 67%, respectively, had CRP>3 mg/L, and 23% and 20%, respectively, had CRP>10 mg/L. Of those with remission or mildly active disease by CDAI (n = 58), DAS28-ESR (n = 39), or DAS28-CRP (n = 70), 49-66% had CRP>3 mg/L, and 10-14% had CRP>10 mg/L. Of patients with moderate disease activity by CDAI (n = 51), DAS28-ESR (n = 78), or DAS28-CRP (n = 66), 67-73% had CRP>3 mg/L, and 25-33% had CRP>10 mg/L. Even among RA patients whose disease is judged to be controlled by joint counts or standardized disease scores, a substantial proportion have CRP levels that are associated high or very high risk for future cardiovascular events in the general population.
1 Excitatory neurotransmitters in brain regions in interictal migraine patients. To examine biochemical differences in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula during the interictal phase of migraine patients. We hypothesized that there may be differences in levels of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters and/or their derivatives in migraine group based on their increased sensitivity to pain. 2D J-resolved proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) data were acquired at 4.0 Tesla (T) from the ACC and insula in 10 migraine patients (7 women, 3 men, age 43 +/- 11 years) and 8 age gender matched controls (7 women, 3 men, age 41 +/- 9 years). Standard statistical analyses including analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no significant metabolite differences between the two subject cohorts in the ACC nor the insula. However, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) introduced a clear separation between subject cohorts based on N-acetyl aspartylglutamate (NAAG) and glutamine (Gln) in the ACC and insula. These results are consistent with glutamatergic abnormalities in the ACC and insula in migraine patients during their interictal period compared to healthy controls. An alteration in excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters and their derivatives may be a contributing factor for migraineurs for a decrease in sensitivity for migraine or a consequence of the chronic migraine state. Such findings, if extrapolated to other regions of the brain would offer new opportunities to modulate central system as interictal or preemptive medications in these patients.
0 Structural motifs recurring in different folds recognize the same ligand fragments. The structural analysis of protein ligand binding sites can provide information relevant for assigning functions to unknown proteins, to guide the drug discovery process and to infer relations among distant protein folds. Previous approaches to the comparative analysis of binding pockets have usually been focused either on the ligand or the protein component. Even though several useful observations have been made with these approaches they both have limitations. In the former case the analysis is restricted to binding pockets interacting with similar ligands, while in the latter it is difficult to systematically check whether the observed structural similarities have a functional significance. Here we propose a novel methodology that takes into account the structure of both the binding pocket and the ligand. We first look for local similarities in a set of binding pockets and then check whether the bound ligands, even if completely different, share a common fragment that can account for the presence of the structural motif. Thanks to this method we can identify structural motifs whose functional significance is explained by the presence of shared features in the interacting ligands. The application of this method to a large dataset of binding pockets allows the identification of recurring protein motifs that bind specific ligand fragments, even in the context of molecules with a different overall structure. In addition some of these motifs are present in a high number of evolutionarily unrelated proteins.
0 Combined effects of obesity and type 2 diabetes contribute to increased breast cancer risk in premenopausal women. Both obesity and type 2 diabetes are among the risk factors for breast cancer development. Combined effect of these metabolic abnormalities on breast cancer risk however, has not been examined in premenopausal women. We tested this association in type 2 diabetic women, categorized as obese, overweight and normal body weight groups based on BMI. A total of 101 subjects were included in this study. Serum levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, C reactive protein, leptin, TGF-alpha, adiponectin and insulin were measured by ELISA. Data were logarithmically transformed for variables not normally distributed. Analysis of variance with post-hoc Bonferroni was applied to compare the data between the groups. Simple and partial correlation coefficients between the variables were determined and a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the relationships between the variables of interest. Significantly increased levels of IL-6, C reactive protein, leptin and significantly decreased levels of adiponectin were found in obese group, while the levels of TNF-alpha and TGF-alpha were unaltered. A positive correlation between waist circumference and IL-6 was found in obese group. Similarly, C reactive protein, waist and hip circumferences were linearly correlated with BMI in obese group. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed several significant predictors for breast cancer risk. Obesity and type 2 diabetes, owing to their effects on adipocytokines and inflammatory mediators, contribute to increased breast cancer risk in premenopausal women. This study emphasizes healthy life style and better management of these metabolic disorders to avoid the pathogenesis of breast cancer and of other chronic diseases.
0 Methylphenidate improves response inhibition but not reflection-impulsivity in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Impulsivity is a cardinal feature of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is thought to underlie many of the cognitive and behavioural symptoms associated with the disorder. Impairments on some measures of impulsivity have been shown to be responsive to pharmacotherapy. However, impulsivity is a multi-factorial construct and the degree to which different forms of impulsivity contribute to impairments in ADHD or respond to pharmacological treatments remains unclear. The aims of the study were to assess the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on the performance of children with ADHD on measures of reflection-impulsivity and response inhibition and to compare with the performance of healthy volunteers. Twenty-one boys (aged 7-13 years) diagnosed with ADHD underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of MPH (0.5 mg/kg) during which they performed the Information Sampling Task (IST) and the Stop Signal Task. A healthy age- and education-matched control group was tested on the same measures without medication. Children with ADHD were impaired on measures of response inhibition, but did not demonstrate reflection-impulsivity on the IST. However, despite sampling a similar amount of information as their peers, the ADHD group made more poor decisions. MPH improved performance on measures of response inhibition and variability of response, but did not affect measures of reflection-impulsivity or quality of decision-making. MPH differentially affected two forms of impulsivity in children with ADHD and failed to ameliorate their poor decision-making on the information sampling test.
0 Superficial endobronchial lung cancer: radiologic-pathologic correlation. To analyze the plain chest radiographic and CT findings of superficial endobronchial lung cancer and to correlate these with the findings of histopathology. This study involved 19 consecutive patients with pathologically proven lung cancer confined to the bronchial wall. Chest radiographs and CT scans were reviewed for the presence of parenchymal abnormalities, endobronchial nodules, bronchial obstruction, and bronchial wall thickening and stenosis. The CT and histopathologic findings were compared. Sixteen of the 19 patients had abnormal chest radiographic findings, while in 15 (79%), CT revealed bronchial abnormalities: an endobronchial nodule in seven, bronchial obstruction in five, and bronchial wall thickening and stenosis in three. Histopathologically, the lesions appeared as endobronchial nodules in 11 patients, irregular thickening of the bronchial wall in six, elevated mucosa in one, and carcinoma in situ in one. CT helps detect superficial endobronchial lung cancer in 79% of these patients, though there is some disagreement between the CT findings and the pathologic pattern of bronchial lesions. Although nonspecific, findings of bronchial obstruction or bronchial wall thickening and stenosis should not be overlooked, and if clinically necessary, bronchoscopy should be performed.
0 Does genetic diversity predict health in humans? Genetic diversity, especially at genes important for immune functioning within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), has been associated with fitness-related traits, including disease resistance, in many species. Recently, genetic diversity has been associated with mate preferences in humans. Here we asked whether these preferences are adaptive in terms of obtaining healthier mates. We investigated whether genetic diversity (heterozygosity and standardized mean d(2)) at MHC and nonMHC microsatellite loci, predicted health in 153 individuals. Individuals with greater allelic diversity (d(2)) at nonMHC loci and at one MHC locus, linked to HLA-DRB1, reported fewer symptoms over a four-month period than individuals with lower d(2). In contrast, there were no associations between MHC or nonMHC heterozygosity and health. NonMHC-d(2) has previously been found to predict male preferences for female faces. Thus, the current findings suggest that nonMHC diversity may play a role in both natural and sexual selection acting on human populations.
1 Comparison of self-reported health & healthcare utilisation between asylum seekers and refugees: an observational study. Adult refugees and asylum seekers living in Western countries experience a high prevalence of mental health problems, especially post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. This study compares and contrasts the prevalence of health problems, and potential risk factors as well as the utilisation of health services by asylum seekers and refugees in the Irish context. Cross sectional study using validated self reported health status questionnaires of adult asylum seekers (n = 60) and refugees (n = 28) from 30 countries, living in Ireland. Outcome measures included: general health status (SF-36), presence of PTSD symptoms and anxiety/depression symptoms. Data on chronic conditions and pre or post migration stressors are also reported. The two groups are compared for utilisation of the health care system and the use of over the counter medications. Asylum seekers were significantly more likely than refugees to report symptoms of PTSD (OR 6.3, 95% CI: 2.2-17.9) and depression/anxiety (OR 5.8, 95% CI: 2.2-15.4), while no significant difference was found in self-reported general health. When adjusted by multivariable regression, the presence of more than one chronic disease (OR 4.0, 95%CI: 1.3-12.7; OR 3.4, 95% CI: 1.2-10.1), high levels of pre migration stressors (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 1.1-11.9; OR 3.3, 95% CI: 1.0-10.4) or post migration stressors (OR 17.3, 95% CI: 4.9-60.8; OR 3.9, 95% CI: 1.2-12.3) were independent predictors of self reported PTSD or depression/anxiety symptoms respectively, however, residence status was no longer significantly associated with PTSD or depression/anxiety. Residence status may act as a marker for other explanatory variables; our results show it has a strong relationship with post migration stressors (chi2 = 19.74, df = 1, P < 0.001).In terms of health care utilisation, asylum seekers use GP services more often than refugees, while no significant difference was found between these groups for use of dentists, medication, hospitalisation or mental health services. Asylum seekers have a higher level of self reported PTSD and depression/anxiety symptoms compared to refugees. However, residence status appears to act as a marker for post migration stressors. Compared to refugees, asylum seekers utilise GP services more often, but not mental health services.
3 Predictors of anti-convulsant treatment failure in children presenting with malaria and prolonged seizures in Kampala, Uganda. In endemic areas, falciparum malaria remains the leading cause of seizures in children presenting to emergency departments. In addition, seizures in malaria have been shown to increase morbidity and mortality in these patients. The management of seizures in malaria is sometimes complicated by the refractory nature of these seizures to readily available anti-convulsants. The objective of this study was to determine predictors of anti-convulsant treatment failure and seizure recurrence after initial control among children with malaria. In a previous study, the efficacy and safety of buccal midazolam was compared to that of rectal diazepam in the treatment of prolonged seizures in children aged three months to 12 years in Kampala, Uganda. For this study, predictive models were used to determine risk factors for anti-convulsant treatment failure and seizure recurrence among the 221 of these children with malaria. Using predictive models, focal seizures (OR 3.21; 95% CI 1.42-7.25, p = 0.005), cerebral malaria (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.20-4.91, p = 0.01) and a blood sugar >or=200 mg/dl at presentation (OR 2.84; 95% CI 1.11-7.20, p = 0.02) were independent predictors of treatment failure (seizure persistence beyond 10 minutes or recurrence within one hour of treatment). Predictors of seizure recurrence included: 1) cerebral malaria (HR 3.32; 95% CI 1.94-5.66, p < 0.001), 2) presenting with multiple seizures (HR 2.45; 95% CI 1.42-4.23, p = 0.001), 3) focal seizures (HR 2.86; 95% CI 1.49-5.49, p = 0.002), 4) recent use of diazepam (HR 2.43; 95% CI 1.19-4.95, p = 0.01) and 5) initial control of the seizure with diazepam (HR 1.96; 95% CI 1.16-3.33, p = 0.01). Specific predictors, including cerebral malaria, can identify patients with malaria at risk of anti-convulsant treatment failure and seizure recurrence.
1 Nonalbuminuric renal impairment in type 2 diabetic patients and in the general population (national evaluation of the frequency of renal impairment cO-existing with NIDDM [NEFRON] 11). OBJECTIVE Most diabetic patients with impaired renal function have a urinary albumin excretion rate in the normal range. In these patients, the etiology of renal impairment is unclear, and it is also unclear whether this nonalbumunuric renal impairment is unique to diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this study, we examined the frequency and predictors of nonalbumunuric renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) in a nationally representative cohort of 3,893 patients with type 2 diabetes and compared our findings with rates observed in the general population from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab) survey (n = 11,247). RESULTS Of the 23.1% of individuals with type 2 diabetes who had eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (95% CI 21.8-24.5%), more than half (55%) had a urinary albumin excretion rate that was persistently in the normal range. This rate of renal impairment was predictably higher than that observed in the general population (adjusted odds ratio 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, P < 0.01) but was solely due to chronic kidney disease associated with albuminuria. In contrast, renal impairment in the absence of albuminuria was less common in those with diabetes than in the general population, independent of sex, ethnicity, and duration of diabetes (0.6, 0.5-0.7, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Nonalbuminuric renal impairment is not more common in those with diabetes. However, its impact may be more significant. New studies are required to address the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of nonalbuminuric renal disease.
3 Reading between eye saccades. Skilled adult readers, in contrast to beginners, show no or little increase in reading latencies as a function of the number of letters in words up to seven letters. The information extraction strategy underlying such efficiency in word identification is still largely unknown, and methods that allow tracking of the letter information extraction through time between eye saccades are needed to fully address this question. The present study examined the use of letter information during reading, by means of the Bubbles technique. Ten participants each read 5,000 five-letter French words sampled in space-time within a 200 ms window. On the temporal dimension, our results show that two moments are especially important during the information extraction process. On the spatial dimension, we found a bias for the upper half of words. We also show for the first time that letter positions four, one, and three are particularly important for the identification of five-letter words. Our findings are consistent with either a partially parallel reading strategy or an optimal serial reading strategy. We show using computer simulations that this serial reading strategy predicts an absence of a word-length effect for words from four- to seven letters in length. We believe that the Bubbles technique will play an important role in further examining the nature of reading between eye saccades.
3 Financial incentives for return of service in underserved areas: a systematic review. In many geographic regions, both in developing and in developed countries, the number of health workers is insufficient to achieve population health goals. Financial incentives for return of service are intended to alleviate health worker shortages: A (future) health worker enters into a contract to work for a number of years in an underserved area in exchange for a financial pay-off. We carried out systematic literature searches of PubMed, the Excerpta Medica database, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the National Health Services Economic Evaluation Database for studies evaluating outcomes of financial-incentive programs published up to February 2009. To identify articles for review, we combined three search themes (health workers or students, underserved areas, and financial incentives). In the initial search, we identified 10,495 unique articles, 10,302 of which were excluded based on their titles or abstracts. We conducted full-text reviews of the remaining 193 articles and of 26 additional articles identified in reference lists or by colleagues. Forty-three articles were included in the final review. We extracted from these articles information on the financial-incentive programs (name, location, period of operation, objectives, target groups, definition of underserved area, financial incentives and obligation) and information on the individual studies (authors, publication dates, types of study outcomes, study design, sample criteria and sample size, data sources, outcome measures and study findings, conclusions, and methodological limitations). We reviewed program results (descriptions of recruitment, retention, and participant satisfaction), program effects (effectiveness in influencing health workers to provide care, to remain, and to be satisfied with work and personal life in underserved areas), and program impacts (effectiveness in influencing health systems and health outcomes). Of the 43 reviewed studies 34 investigated financial-incentive programs in the US. The remaining studies evaluated programs in Japan (five studies), Canada (two), New Zealand (one) and South Africa (one). The programs started between 1930 and 1998. We identified five different types of programs (service-requiring scholarships, educational loans with service requirements, service-option educational loans, loan repayment programs, and direct financial incentives). Financial incentives to serve for one year in an underserved area ranged from year-2000 United States dollars 1,358 to 28,470. All reviewed studies were observational. The random-effects estimate of the pooled proportion of all eligible program participants who had either fulfilled their obligation or were fulfilling it at the time of the study was 71% (95% confidence interval 60-80%). Seven studies compared retention in the same (underserved) area between program participants and non-participants. Six studies found that participants were less likely than non-participants to remain in the same area (five studies reported the difference to be statistically significant, while one study did not report a significance level); one study did not find a significant difference in retention in the same area. Thirteen studies compared provision of care or retention in any underserved area between participants and non-participants. Eleven studies found that participants were more likely to (continue to) practice in any underserved area (nine studies reported the difference to be statistically significant, while two studies did not provide the results of a significance test); two studies found that program participants were significantly less likely than non-participants to remain in any underserved area. Seven studies investigated the satisfaction of participants with their work and personal lives in underserved areas. Financial-incentive programs for return of service are one of the few health policy interventions intended to improve the distribution of human resources for health on which substantial evidence exists. However, the majority of studies are from the US, and only one study reports findings from a developing country, limiting generalizability. The existing studies show that financial-incentive programs have placed substantial numbers of health workers in underserved areas and that program participants are more likely than non-participants to work in underserved areas in the long run, even though they are less likely to remain at the site of original placement. As none of the existing studies can fully rule out that the observed differences between participants and non-participants are due to selection effects, the evidence to date does not allow the inference that the programs have caused increases in the supply of health workers to underserved areas.
0 Coordinated surface activities in Variovorax paradoxus EPS. Variovorax paradoxus is an aerobic soil bacterium frequently associated with important biodegradative processes in nature. Our group has cultivated a mucoid strain of Variovorax paradoxus for study as a model of bacterial development and response to environmental conditions. Colonies of this organism vary widely in appearance depending on agar plate type. Surface motility was observed on minimal defined agar plates with 0.5% agarose, similar in nature to swarming motility identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We examined this motility under several culture conditions, including inhibition of flagellar motility using Congo Red. We demonstrated that the presence of a wetting agent, mineral, and nutrient content of the media altered the swarming phenotype. We also demonstrated that the wetting agent reduces the surface tension of the agar. We were able to directly observe the presence of the wetting agent in the presence and absence of Congo Red, and found that incubation in a humidified chamber inhibited the production of wetting agent, and also slowed the progression of the swarming colony. We observed that swarming was related to both carbon and nitrogen sources, as well as mineral salts base. The phosphate concentration of the mineral base was critical for growth and swarming on glucose, but not succinate. Swarming on other carbon sources was generally only observed using M9 salts mineral base. Rapid swarming was observed on malic acid, d-sorbitol, casamino acids, and succinate. Swarming at a lower but still detectable rate was observed on glucose and sucrose, with weak swarming on maltose. Nitrogen source tests using succinate as carbon source demonstrated two distinct forms of swarming, with very different macroscopic swarm characteristics. Rapid swarming was observed when ammonium ion was provided as nitrogen source, as well as when histidine, tryptophan, or glycine was provided. Slower swarming was observed with methionine, arginine, or tyrosine. Large effects of mineral content on swarming were seen with tyrosine and methionine as nitrogen sources. Biofilms form readily under various culture circumstances, and show wide variance in structure under different conditions. The amount of biofilm as measured by crystal violet retention was dependent on carbon source, but not nitrogen source. Filamentous growth in the biofilm depends on shear stress, and is enhanced by continuous input of nutrients in chemostat culture. Our studies have established that the beta-proteobacterium Variovorax paradoxus displays a number of distinct physiologies when grown on surfaces, indicative of a complex response to several growth parameters. We have identified a number of factors that drive sessile and motile surface phenotypes. This work forms a basis for future studies using this genetically tractable soil bacterium to study the regulation of microbial development on surfaces.
3 Evaluation of the psychometric properties of the SF-36 health survey for use among Turkish and Moroccan ethnic minority populations in the Netherlands. To evaluate the psychometrics of the SF-36 Health Survey among Turkish and Moroccan ethnic minority populations in the Netherlands and to compare the results to those based on the indigenous Dutch population. Data were derived from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice. In total, SF-36 data were available for 409 Turkish, 377 Moroccan, and 9,628 Dutch respondents. Language subgroup analyses were performed for the Turkish (n = 162) and Moroccan-Arabic (n = 52) versions of the SF-36. Psychometric properties were evaluated by descriptive statistics, factor analysis, internal consistency estimates, known-group comparisons, and differential item function (DIF) analysis. Low levels of missing SF-36 data were observed across all groups. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized SF-36 scale structure for the Dutch and Turkish group, but high correlations between the MH and VT factors were observed in the Moroccan group. All Cronbach's alpha coefficients were above 0.70, except for the Vitality scale in the Moroccan group and the Vitality and Social Functioning scales in the Moroccan-Arabic language subgroup. Known-groups validity was found across samples using age, sex, education, and comorbidity as grouping variables, but not marital status. Some evidence for DIF was found in both ethnic group samples. The results generally support the use of the SF-36 for general population research among Turkish and Moroccan ethnic minorities in the Netherlands. Additional studies are needed to confirm the psychometrics of the questionnaire when used among these populations in other Western European countries.
2 Transcatheter arterial embolization of arterial esophageal bleeding with the use of N-butyl cyanoacrylate. To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of a transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) for the treatment of arterial esophageal bleeding. Between August 2000 and April 2008, five patients diagnosed with arterial esophageal bleeding by conventional angiography, CT-angiography or endoscopy, underwent a TAE with NBCA. We mixed NBCA with iodized oil at ratios of 1:1 to 1:4 to supply radiopacity and achieve a proper polymerization time. After embolization, we evaluated the angiographic and clinical success, recurrent bleeding, and procedure-related complications. The bleeding esophageal artery directly originated from the aorta in four patients and from the left inferior phrenic artery in one patient. Although four patients had an underlying coagulopathy at the time of the TAE, angiographic and clinical success was achieved in all five patients. In addition, no procedure-related complications such as esophageal infarction were observed during this study. NBCA can be an effective and feasible embolic agent in patients with active arterial esophageal bleeding, even with pre-existing coagulopathy.
1 International Diabetes Federation guideline for management of postmeal glucose: a review of recommendations. Diabetes is a significant and growing concern, with over 246 million people around the world living with the disease and another 308 million with impaired glucose tolerance. Depending on the resources of different nations, intervention has generally focused on optimizing overall glycaemic control as assessed by glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values. Nevertheless, increasing evidence supports the importance of controlling all three members of the glucose triad, namely HbA(1c), FPG and postmeal glucose (PMG) in order to improve outcome in diabetes. As part of its global mission to promote diabetes care and prevention and to find a cure, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recently developed a guideline that reviews evidence to date on PMG and the development of diabetic complications. Based on an extensive database search of the literature, and guided by a Steering and Development Committee including experts from around the world, the IDF Guideline for Management of Postmeal Glucose offers recommendations for appropriate clinical management of PMG. These recommendations are intended to help clinicians and organizations in developing strategies for effective management of PMG in individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The following review highlights the recommendations of the guideline, the supporting evidence provided and the major conclusions drawn. The full guideline is available for download at http://www.idf.org.
1 The pattern and diagnostic criteria of sensory neuronopathy: a case-control study. Acquired sensory neuronopathies encompass a group of paraneoplastic, dysimmune, toxic or idiopathic disorders characterized by degeneration of peripheral sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia. As dorsal root ganglia cannot easily be explored, the clinical diagnosis of these disorders may be difficult. The question as to whether there exists a common clinical pattern of sensory neuronopathies, allowing the establishment of validated and easy-to-use diagnostic criteria, has not yet been addressed. In this study, logistic regression was used to construct diagnostic criteria on a retrospective study population of 78 patients with sensory neuronopathies and 56 with other sensory neuropathies. For this, sensory neuronopathy was provisionally considered as unambiguous in 44 patients with paraneoplastic disorder or cisplatin treatment and likely in 34 with a dysimmune or idiopathic setting who may theoretically have another form of neuropathy. To test the homogeneity of the sensory neuronopathy population, likely candidates were compared with unambiguous cases and then the whole population was compared with the other sensory neuropathies population. Criteria accuracy was checked on 37 prospective patients referred for diagnosis of sensory neuropathy. In the study population, sensory neuronopathy showed a common clinical and electrophysiological pattern that was independent of the underlying cause, including unusual forms with only patchy sensory loss, mild electrical motor nerve abnormalities and predominant small fibre or isolated lower limb involvement. Logistic regression allowed the construction of a set of criteria that gave fair results with the following combination: ataxia in the lower or upper limbs + asymmetrical distribution + sensory loss not restricted to the lower limbs + at least one sensory action potential absent or three sensory action potentials <30% of the lower limit of normal in the upper limbs + less than two nerves with abnormal motor nerve conduction study in the lower limbs.
2 Improving tuberculosis care in low income countries - a qualitative study of patients' understanding of "patient support" in Nepal. In the new Stop TB Strategy for Tuberculosis (TB) Care, direct observation of treatment has been replaced by "supervision and patient support". However, it is still unclear what patient support means and how it is to be best implemented. The objective of this study was to accurately document patients' support needs during TB treatment from their own perspectives, to inform development of appropriate support and supervision strategies that meet patients' needs. In-depth individual interviews and focus group discussions were conducted in three districts in Nepal. Analysis took place concurrently with data collection to allow emerging issues to guide selection of subsequent interviewees. In total 23 patients, 15 male and 8 female, were interviewed and six focus group discussions were held. Issues from these interviews were grouped into emergent themes. Respondents reported that the burden of treatment for TB was high, particularly in terms of difficulties with social and psychological aspects of undergoing treatment. They saw three main areas for support during their treatment: relevant information for them and their families about their disease, its treatment, potential side-effects and what they should do if side-effects arise; approachable and supportive healthcare staff with whom patients feel comfortable discussing (often non-medical) problems that arise during treatment; and some flexibility in treatment to allow essential elements of patients' lives (such as income generation, food-growing and childcare) to continue. They were anxious to ensure that family support did not absolve healthcare workers from their own support responsibilities. In order to support people with TB more during their treatment, health policy and practice must appreciate that TB affects all aspects of TB patients' lives. A focus on caring for each patient as an individual should underlie all aspects of treatment. Improved communication between healthcare providers and patients and increased patient knowledge and understanding of the treatment programme would give those receiving treatment a sense of individual empowerment and raise their confidence in treatment.
1 Epsilon haemoglobin specific antibodies with applications in noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. Invasive procedures for prenatal diagnosis are associated with increased risk of abortion; thus, development of noninvasive procedures would be beneficial. Based on the observation that embryonic nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) crosses the placenta and enters the circulation of pregnant women, the ability to identify such cell would allow development of such procedures. Identification of NRBCs in blood samples would be possible provided that specific antibodies are available. Here we have isolated recombinant antibodies using phage display. From the panel of antibody fragments specifically recognising epsilon-Hb, one was chosen for further characterization, DAb1. DAb1 binds to epsilon-Hb both in Western blots and immunocytochemistry. Several epsilon-Hb positive cells were detected in a blood sample taken as postchorionic villus sampling (CVS). To evaluate the sensitivity of the method, K562 cells (which express epsilon-Hb) were spiked in a blood sample followed by staining in solution and FACS analysis.
3 Identifying alemtuzumab as an anti-myeloid cell antiangiogenic therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Murine studies suggest that myeloid cells such as vascular leukocytes (VLC) and Tie2+ monocytes play a critical role in tumor angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Myeloid cells are a primary cause of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. The elimination of these cells from the tumor microenvironment significantly restricts tumor growth in both spontaneous and xenograft murine tumor models. Thus animal studies indicate that myeloid cells are potential therapeutic targets for solid tumor therapy. Abundant VLC and Tie2+ monocytes have been reported in human cancer. Unfortunately, the importance of VLC in human cancer growth remains untested as there are no confirmed therapeutics to target human VLC. We used FACS to analyze VLC in ovarian and non-ovarian tumors, and characterize the relationship of VLC and Tie2-monocytes. We performed qRT-PCR and FACS on human VLC to assess the expression of the CD52 antigen, the target of the immunotherapeutic Alemtuzumab. We assessed Alemtuzumab's ability to induce complement-mediated VLC killing in vitro and in human tumor ascites. Finally we assessed the impact of anti-CD52 immuno-toxin therapy on murine ovarian tumor growth. Human VLC are present in ovarian and non-ovarian tumors. The majority of VLC appear to be Tie2+ monocytes. VLC and Tie2+ monocytes express high levels of CD52, the target of the immunotherapeutic Alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab potently induces complement-mediated lysis of VLC in vitro and ex-vivo in ovarian tumor ascites. Anti-CD52 immunotherapy targeting VLC restricts tumor angiogenesis and growth in murine ovarian cancer. These studies confirm VLC/myeloid cells as therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer. Our data provide critical pre-clinical evidence supporting the use of Alemtuzumab in clinical trials to test its efficacy as an anti-myeloid cell antiangiogenic therapeutic in ovarian cancer. The identification of an FDA approved anti-VLC agent with a history of clinical use will allow immediate proof-of-principle clinical trials in patients with ovarian cancer.
0 Small RNAs originated from pseudogenes: cis- or trans-acting? Pseudogenes are significant components of eukaryotic genomes, and some have acquired novel regulatory roles. To date, no study has characterized rice pseudogenes systematically or addressed their impact on the structure and function of the rice genome. In this genome-wide study, we have identified 11,956 non-transposon-related rice pseudogenes, most of which are from gene duplications. About 12% of the rice protein-coding genes, half of which are in singleton families, have a pseudogene paralog. Interestingly, we found that 145 of these pseudogenes potentially gave rise to antisense small RNAs after examining approximately 1.5 million small RNAs from developing rice grains. The majority (>50%) of these antisense RNAs are 24-nucleotides long, a feature often seen in plant repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR2) and Dicer-like protein 3 (DCL3), suggesting that some pseudogene-derived siRNAs may be implicated in repressing pseudogene transcription (i.e., cis-acting). Multiple lines of evidence, however, indicate that small RNAs from rice pseudogenes might also function as natural antisense siRNAs either by interacting with the complementary sense RNAs from functional parental genes (38 cases) or by forming double-strand RNAs with transcripts of adjacent paralogous pseudogenes (2 cases) (i.e., trans-acting). Further examinations of five additional small RNA libraries revealed that pseudogene-derived antisense siRNAs could be produced in specific rice developmental stages or physiological growth conditions, suggesting their potentially important roles in normal rice development. In summary, our results show that pseudogenes derived from protein-coding genes are prevalent in the rice genome, and a subset of them are strong candidates for producing small RNAs with novel regulatory roles. Our findings suggest that pseudogenes of exapted functions may be a phenomenon ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms.
1 Cytotoxic effect of recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis CFP-10/ESAT-6 protein on the crucial pathways of WI-38 cells. To unravel the cytotoxic effect of the recombinant CFP-10/ESAT-6 protein (rCFES) on WI-38 cells, an integrative analysis approach, combining time-course microarray data and annotated pathway databases, was proposed with the emphasis on identifying the potentially crucial pathways. The potentially crucial pathways were selected based on a composite criterion characterizing the average significance and topological properties of important genes. The analysis results suggested that the regulatory effect of rCFES was at least involved in cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, and metabolisms of WI-38 cells. The survivability of WI-38 cells, in particular, was significantly decreased to 62% with 12.5 microM rCFES. Furthermore, the focal adhesion pathway was identified as the potentially most-crucial pathway and 58 of 65 important genes in this pathway were downregulated by rCFES treatment. Using qRT-PCR, we have confirmed the changes in the expression levels of LAMA4, PIK3R3, BIRC3, and NFKBIA, suggesting that these proteins may play an essential role in the cytotoxic process in the rCFES-treated WI-38 cells.
0 A method for studying protistan diversity using massively parallel sequencing of V9 hypervariable regions of small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes. Massively parallel pyrosequencing of amplicons from the V6 hypervariable regions of small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes is commonly used to assess diversity and richness in bacterial and archaeal populations. Recent advances in pyrosequencing technology provide read lengths of up to 240 nucleotides. Amplicon pyrosequencing can now be applied to longer variable regions of the SSU rRNA gene including the V9 region in eukaryotes. We present a protocol for the amplicon pyrosequencing of V9 regions for eukaryotic environmental samples for biodiversity inventories and species richness estimation. The International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM) and the Microbial Inventory Research Across Diverse Aquatic Long Term Ecological Research Sites (MIRADA-LTERs) projects are already employing this protocol for tag sequencing of eukaryotic samples in a wide diversity of both marine and freshwater environments. Massively parallel pyrosequencing of eukaryotic V9 hypervariable regions of SSU rRNA genes provides a means of estimating species richness from deeply-sampled populations and for discovering novel species from the environment.
1 Adeno-associated virus serotype-9 efficiently transduces the retinal outer plexiform layer. Adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (AAV-9) is a promising gene delivery vector. In this study, we evaluated AAV-9 transduction in the mouse retina. Three different AAV vectors were used in our study: AAV-9.RSV.AP, AAV-9.CMV.eGFP, and AAV-9.CMV.R4-23/C. In these vectors, two different promoters (the cytomegalovirus promoter-CMV promoter and the Rous sarcoma virus-RSV promoter) were used to express three different transgenes including the alkaline phosphatase (AP) gene, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene, and a therapeutic microdystrophin gene (the R4-23/C). Specifically, 1 microl AAV-9 reporter gene vectors (1x10(9) viral genome particles of AAV-9.RSV.AP or 1x10(10) viral genome particles of AAV-9.CMV.eGFP) were administered subretinally to young (2-3-week-old), adult (3-month-old), and old (12-month-old) C57BL/6J mice. To evaluate AAV-9 transduction in a diseased retina, we injected subretinally 1x10(9) viral genome particles of AAV-9.CMV.R4-23/C to mdx(3cv) mice, which we used as a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Transgene expression was examined by histochemical as well as immunofluorescence staining at three and five weeks after injection. Electroretinograms were recorded five weeks after subretinal AAV-9.RSV.AP injection. Subretinal injection yielded widespread transduction throughout the retina in all age groups. Robust expression was seen in the retinal pigment epithelium, outer nuclear layer, and in Müller cells. Interestingly a synaptic layer, the outer plexiform layer (OPL), also showed intensive expression. Transduction of the synaptic layer was further confirmed by immunostaining for C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2), a marker for the photoreceptor synaptic ribbon. Dystrophin is normally expressed in the OPL photoreceptor terminals. This expression is lost in DMD patients and mdx(3cv) mice. Consistent with our findings in normal mice, we observed efficient microdystrophin expression in the OPL after AAV-9.CMV.R4-23/C infection. At five weeks after subretinal delivery of AAV-9.RSV.AP, no morphology or ERG abnormalities were observed. We demonstrated that AAV-9 is a potent vector for retinal gene delivery. Furthermore, subretinal AAV-9 administration did not cause appreciable acute retinal damages. In summary, AAV-9-mediated OPL transduction holds promise for treating diseases that primarily affect this layer.
3 Oral vaccination with a recombinant Salmonella vaccine vector provokes systemic HIV-1 subtype C Gag-specific CD4+ Th1 and Th2 cell immune responses in mice. Recombinant Salmonella vaccine vectors may potentially be used to induce specific CD4+ T cell responses against foreign viral antigens. Such immune responses are required features of vaccines against pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The aim of this study was to investigate the induction of systemic HIV-1-specific CD4+ T helper (Th) responses in mice after oral immunization with a live attenuated Salmonella vaccine vector that expressed HIV-1 subtype C Gag. Groups of BALB/c mice were vaccinated orally three times (4 weeks apart) with this recombinant Salmonella. At sacrifice, 28 days after the last immunization, systemic CD4+ Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunospot assay and cytometric bead array. HIV-1 Gag-specific IgG1 and IgG2a humoral responses in the serum were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mice vaccinated with the recombinant Salmonella elicited both HIV-1-specific Th1 (interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)) and Th2 (interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5)) cytokine responses. The vaccine induced 70 (IFN-gamma) spot-forming units (SFUs)/10e(6) splenocytes and 238 IL-4 SFUs/10e(6) splenocytes. Splenocytes from vaccinated mice also produced high levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines upon stimulation with a Gag CD4 peptide. The levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-5 were 7.5-, 29.1-, 26.2- and 89.3-fold above the background, respectively. Both HIV-1 Gag-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were detected in the sera of vaccinated mice. The study highlights the potential of orally-delivered attenuated Salmonella as mucosal vaccine vectors for HIV-1 Subtype C Gag to induce Gag-specific CD4+ Th1 and Th2 cellular immune responses and antibodies which may be important characteristics required for protection against HIV-1 infection.
0 Candida albicans cell surface superoxide dismutases degrade host-derived reactive oxygen species to escape innate immune surveillance. Mammalian innate immune cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the oxidative burst reaction to destroy invading microbial pathogens. Using quantitative real-time ROS assays, we show here that both yeast and filamentous forms of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans trigger ROS production in primary innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Through a reverse genetic approach, we demonstrate that coculture of macrophages or myeloid dendritic cells with C. albicans cells lacking the superoxide dismutase (SOD) Sod5 leads to massive extracellular ROS accumulation in vitro. ROS accumulation was further increased in coculture with fungal cells devoid of both Sod4 and Sod5. Survival experiments show that C. albicans mutants lacking Sod5 and Sod4 exhibit a severe loss of viability in the presence of macrophages in vitro. The reduced viability of sod5Delta/Delta and sod4Delta/Deltasod5Delta/Delta mutants relative to wild type is not evident with macrophages from gp91phox(-/-) mice defective in the oxidative burst activity, demonstrating a ROS-dependent killing activity of macrophages targeting fungal pathogens. These data show a physiological role for cell surface SODs in detoxifying ROS, and suggest a mechanism whereby C. albicans, and perhaps many other microbial pathogens, can evade host immune surveillance in vivo.
1 Mammographic density and epithelial histopathologic markers. We explored the association of mammographic density, a breast cancer risk factor, with hormonal and proliferation markers in benign tissue from tumor blocks of pre-and postmenopausal breast cancer cases. Breast cancer cases were recruited from a case-control study on breast density. Mammographic density was assessed on digitized prediagnostic mammograms using a computer-assisted method. For 279 participants of the original study, we obtained tumor blocks and prepared tissue microarrays (TMA), but benign tissue cores were only available for 159 women. The TMAs were immunostained for estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2/neu, Ki-67, and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA). We applied general linear models to compute breast density according to marker expression. A substantial proportion of the samples were in the low or no staining categories. None of the results was statistically significant, but women with PR and ERbeta staining had 3.4% and 2.4% higher percent density. The respective values for Caucasians were 5.7% and 11.6% but less in Japanese women (3.5% and -1.1%). Percent density was 3.4% higher in women with any Ki-67 staining and 2.2% in those with positive PCNA staining. This study detected little evidence for an association between mammographic density and expression of steroid receptors and proliferation markers in breast tissue, but it illustrated the problems of locating tumor blocks and benign breast tissue samples for epidemiologic research. Given the suggestive findings, future studies examining estrogen effects in tissue, cell proliferation, and density in the breast may be informative.
0 Is health-related quality of life associated with the risk of low-energy wrist fracture: a case-control study. Some risk factors for low-energy wrist fracture have been identified. However, self-reported measures such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have not been examined as potential risk factors for wrist fracture. The aims of this study were to compare HRQOL prior to a low-energy wrist fracture in elderly patients (>or= 50 years) with HRQOL in age- and sex-matched controls, and to explore the association between HRQOL and wrist fracture after adjusting for known risk factors for fracture such as age, weight, osteoporosis and falls. Patients with a low-energy wrist fracture (n = 181) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 181) were studied. Shortly after fracture (median 10 days), patients assessed their HRQOL before fracture using the Short Form 36 (SF-36). Statistical tests included t tests and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Several dimensions of HRQOL were significantly associated with wrist fracture. The direction of the associations with wrist fracture varied between the different sub-dimensions of the SF-36. After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, higher scores on general health (odds ratio (OR) = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-1.56), bodily pain (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.03-1.34) and mental health (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.09-1.79) were related to an increased chance of being a wrist fracture patient rather than a control. In contrast, higher scores on physical role limitation (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.79-0.95) and social function (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.80) decreased this chance. Significant associations with wrist fracture were also found for living alone (OR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.07-3.4), low body mass index (BMI) (OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.98), osteoporosis (OR = 3.30, 95% CI 1.67-6.50) and previous falls (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.16-3.49). Wrist fracture patients perceive themselves to be as healthy as the controls before fracture. Our data indicate that patients with favourable and unfavourable HRQOL measures may be at increased risk of wrist fracture.
3 Prokineticin 1 mediates fetal-maternal dialogue regulating endometrial leukemia inhibitory factor. Implantation requires communication between a receptive endometrium and a healthy blastocyst. This maternal-embryonic crosstalk involves local mediators within the uterine microenvironment. We demonstrate that a secreted protein, prokineticin 1 (PROK1), is expressed in the receptive endometrium and during early pregnancy. PROK1 induces expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in endometrial epithelial cells and first trimester decidua via a Gq-Ca(2+)-cSrc-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-mediated pathway. We show that human embryonic chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induces sequential mRNA expression of PROK1 and LIF in an in vivo baboon model, in human endometrial epithelial cells, and in first-trimester decidua. We have used micro RNA constructs targeted to PROK1 to demonstrate that hCG-mediated LIF expression in the endometrium is dependent on prior induction of PROK1. Dual immunohistochemical analysis colocalized expression of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor, PROK1, PROKR1, and LIF to the glandular epithelial cells of the first trimester decidual tissue. PROK1 enhances adhesion of trophoblast cells to fibronectin and laminin matrices, which are mediated predominantly via LIF induction. These data describe a novel signaling pathway mediating maternal-embryonic crosstalk, in which embryonic hCG via endometrial PROK1 may play a pivotal role in enhancing receptivity and maintaining early pregnancy.
3 Nuclear accumulation of polyglutamine disease proteins and neuropathology. There are nine inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in various disease proteins. Although these polyglutamine proteins have different functions and are localized in different subcellular regions, all the polyQ diseases share a common pathological feature: the nuclear accumulation of polyQ disease proteins and the formation of inclusions. The nuclear accumulation of polyQ proteins in turn leads to gene transcriptional dysregulation and neuropathology. Here we will discuss potential mechanisms behind the nuclear accumulation of mutant polyQ proteins, since an understanding of how polyQ proteins accumulate in the nucleus could help elucidate the pathogenesis of these diseases and develop their treatment.
2 Intravenous versus oral iron supplementation for correction of post-transplant anaemia in renal transplant patients. Post-transplant anaemia remains a common problem after kidney transplantation, with an incidence ranging from nearly 80% at day 0 to about 25% at 1 year. It has been associated with poor graft outcome, and recently has also been shown to be associated with increased mortality.Our transplant unit routinely administers oral iron supplements to renal transplant recipients but this is frequently accompanied by side effects, mainly gastrointestinal intolerance. Intravenous iron is frequently administered to dialysis patients and we sought to investigate this mode of administration in transplant recipients after noticing less anaemia in several patients who had received intravenous iron just prior to being called in for transplantation. This study is a single-centre, prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled trial of oral versus intravenous iron supplements in renal transplant recipients and aims to recruit approximately 100 patients over a 12-month period. Patients will be randomised to receive a single dose of 500 mg iron polymaltose (intravenous iron group) or 2 ferrous sulphate slow-release tablets daily (oral iron group). The primary outcome is time to normalisation of haemoglobin post-transplant. Prospective power calculations have indicated that a minimum of 48 patients in each group would have to be followed up for 3 months in order to have a 90% probability of detecting a halving of the time to correction of haemoglobin levels to > or =110 g/l in iron-treated patients, assuming an alpha of 0.05. All eligible adult patients undergoing renal transplantation at the Princess Alexandra Hospital will be offered participation in the trial. Exclusion criteria will include iron overload (transferrin saturation >50% or ferritin >800 microg/l), or previous intolerance of either oral or intravenous iron supplements. If the trial shows a reduction in the time to correction of anaemia with intravenous iron or less side effects than oral iron, then intravenous iron may become the standard of treatment in this patient group.
1 Primary primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the breast: a case report. Primary primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) are rare malignant tumors, affecting mostly children and adolescents. Only three cases of primary breast PNETs have been reported in the medical literature, with none in Korea. We present a case of a primary PNET of the breast in a 33-year-old woman, with imaging and immunohistopathology findings.
2 The role of anorexia in resistance and tolerance to infections in Drosophila. Most infections induce anorexia but its function, if any, remains unclear. Because this response is common among animals, we hypothesized that infection-induced diet restriction might be an adaptive trait that modulates the host's ability to fight infection. Two defense strategies protect hosts against infections: resistance, which is the ability to control pathogen levels, and tolerance, which helps the host endure infection-induced pathology. Here we show that infected fruit flies become anorexic and that diet restriction alters defenses, increasing the fly's tolerance to Salmonella typhimurium infections while decreasing resistance to Listeria monocytogenes. This suggests that attempts to extend lifespan through diet restriction or the manipulation of pathways mimicking this process will have complicated effects on a host's ability to fight infections.
1 PEP-FOLD: an online resource for de novo peptide structure prediction. Rational peptide design and large-scale prediction of peptide structure from sequence remain a challenge for chemical biologists. We present PEP-FOLD, an online service, aimed at de novo modelling of 3D conformations for peptides between 9 and 25 amino acids in aqueous solution. Using a hidden Markov model-derived structural alphabet (SA) of 27 four-residue letters, PEP-FOLD first predicts the SA letter profiles from the amino acid sequence and then assembles the predicted fragments by a greedy procedure driven by a modified version of the OPEP coarse-grained force field. Starting from an amino acid sequence, PEP-FOLD performs series of 50 simulations and returns the most representative conformations identified in terms of energy and population. Using a benchmark of 25 peptides with 9-23 amino acids, and considering the reproducibility of the runs, we find that, on average, PEP-FOLD locates lowest energy conformations differing by 2.6 A Calpha root mean square deviation from the full NMR structures. PEP-FOLD can be accessed at http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/PEP-FOLD.
3 Activation of NF-kB pathway by virus infection requires Rb expression. The retinoblastoma protein Rb is a tumor suppressor involved in cell cycle control, differentiation, and inhibition of oncogenic transformation. Besides these roles, additional functions in the control of immune response have been suggested. In the present study we investigated the consequences of loss of Rb in viral infection. Here we show that virus replication is increased by the absence of Rb, and that Rb is required for the activation of the NF-kB pathway in response to virus infection. These results reveal a novel role for tumor suppressor Rb in viral infection surveillance and further extend the concept of a link between tumor suppressors and antiviral activity.
0 Individual stearoyl-coa desaturase 1 expression modulates endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation in human myotubes and is associated with skeletal muscle lipid storage and insulin sensitivity in vivo. Increased plasma levels of free fatty acids occur in obesity and type 2 diabetes and contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) such as palmitate especially have lipotoxic effects leading to endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) plays a key role in preventing lipotoxic effects, as it converts SFAs to less harmful monounsaturated fatty acids. Here, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the regulation of SCD1 expression by palmitate exist and influence insulin sensitivity and the cellular response to palmitate. Palmitate-induced gene expression was studied in primary human myotubes of 39 metabolically characterized individuals, as well as in an SCD1-overexpressing cell culture model. SCD1 mRNA expression and inducibility by palmitate in cultured myotubes showed a broad interindividual variation, presumably due to inheritable characteristics of the donors. Overexpression of SCD1 prevented the inflammatory and ER stress response to palmitate exposure. In primary human myotubes, high SCD1 inducibility was associated with a low inflammatory (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, and chemokine [CXC motif] ligand 3 [CXCL3]) and ER stress (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein [C/EBP] homologous protein, activating transcription factor 3 [ATF3], and X-box binding protein 1 [XBP1]) response to palmitate exposure. Finally, palmitate-stimulated SCD1 mRNA expression, positively correlated with intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content of the donors, was measured by (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. After adjustment for IMCL, SCD1 expression and inducibility were positively correlated with insulin sensitivity. We hypothesize that myocellular SCD1 inducibility by palmitate is an individual characteristic that modulates lipid storage, palmitate-induced inflammation, ER stress, and insulin resistance. This may describe individuals with increased capability of innoxious free fatty acid handling and benign triglyceride storage.
0 Mobile genetic element-encoded cytolysin connects virulence to methicillin resistance in MRSA. Bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance have a significant influence on disease severity and treatment options during bacterial infections. Frequently, the underlying genetic determinants are encoded on mobile genetic elements (MGEs). In the leading human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, MGEs that contain antibiotic resistance genes commonly do not contain genes for virulence determinants. The phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) are staphylococcal cytolytic toxins with a crucial role in immune evasion. While all known PSMs are core genome-encoded, we here describe a previously unidentified psm gene, psm-mec, within the staphylococcal methicillin resistance-encoding MGE SCCmec. PSM-mec was strongly expressed in many strains and showed the physico-chemical, pro-inflammatory, and cytolytic characteristics typical of PSMs. Notably, in an S. aureus strain with low production of core genome-encoded PSMs, expression of PSM-mec had a significant impact on immune evasion and disease. In addition to providing high-level resistance to methicillin, acquisition of SCCmec elements encoding PSM-mec by horizontal gene transfer may therefore contribute to staphylococcal virulence by substituting for the lack of expression of core genome-encoded PSMs. Thus, our study reveals a previously unknown role of methicillin resistance clusters in staphylococcal pathogenesis and shows that important virulence and antibiotic resistance determinants may be combined in staphylococcal MGEs.
3 Salmonella in broiler litter and properties of soil at farm location. Contamination of litter in a broiler grow-out house with Salmonella prior to placement of a new flock has been shown to be a precursor of the flock's Salmonella contamination further down the production continuum. In the southern USA, broiler grow-out houses are primarily built on dirt pad foundations that are placed directly on top of the native soil surface. Broiler litter is placed directly on the dirt pad. Multiple grow-out flocks are reared on a single litter batch, and the litter is kept in the houses during downtime between flocks. The effects of environmental determinants on conditions in broiler litter, hence Salmonella ecology within it, has received limited attention. In a field study that included broiler farms in the states of Alabama, Mississippi and Texas we assessed Salmonella in broiler litter at the end of downtime between flocks, i.e. at the time of placement of a new flock for rearing. Here we utilized these results and the U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO) data to test if properties of soil at farm location impacted the probability of Salmonella detection in the litter. The significance of soil properties as risk factors was tested in multilevel regression models after accounting for possible confounding differences among the farms, the participating broiler complexes and companies, and the farms' geographical positioning. Significant associations were observed between infiltration and drainage capabilities of soil at farm location and probability of Salmonella detection in the litter.
0 The first cellular models based on frataxin missense mutations that reproduce spontaneously the defects associated with Friedreich ataxia. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common form of recessive ataxia, is due to reduced levels of frataxin, a highly conserved mitochondrial iron-chaperone involved in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis. Most patients are homozygous for a (GAA)(n) expansion within the first intron of the frataxin gene. A few patients, either with typical or atypical clinical presentation, are compound heterozygous for the GAA expansion and a micromutation. We have developed a new strategy to generate murine cellular models for FRDA: cell lines carrying a frataxin conditional allele were used in combination with an EGFP-Cre recombinase to create murine cellular models depleted for endogenous frataxin and expressing missense-mutated human frataxin. We showed that complete absence of murine frataxin in fibroblasts inhibits cell division and leads to cell death. This lethal phenotype was rescued through transgenic expression of human wild type as well as mutant (hFXN(G130V) and hFXN(I154F)) frataxin. Interestingly, cells expressing the mutated frataxin presented a FRDA-like biochemical phenotype. Though both mutations affected mitochondrial ISC enzymes activities and mitochondria ultrastructure, the hFXN(I154F) mutant presented a more severe phenotype with affected cytosolic and nuclear ISC enzyme activities, mitochondrial iron accumulation and an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. The differential phenotype correlates with disease severity observed in FRDA patients. These new cellular models, which are the first to spontaneously reproduce all the biochemical phenotypes associated with FRDA, are important tools to gain new insights into the in vivo consequences of pathological missense mutations as well as for large-scale pharmacological screening aimed at compensating frataxin deficiency.
3 The two-domain LysX protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is required for production of lysinylated phosphatidylglycerol and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. The well-recognized phospholipids (PLs) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) include several acidic species such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG), cardiolipin, phosphatidylinositol and its mannoside derivatives, in addition to a single basic species, phosphatidylethanolamine. Here we demonstrate that an additional basic PL, lysinylated PG (L-PG), is a component of the PLs of Mtb H37Rv and that the lysX gene encoding the two-domain lysyl-transferase (mprF)-lysyl-tRNA synthetase (lysU) protein is responsible for L-PG production. The Mtb lysX mutant is sensitive to cationic antibiotics and peptides, shows increased association with lysosome-associated membrane protein-positive vesicles, and it exhibits altered membrane potential compared to wild type. A lysX complementing strain expressing the intact lysX gene, but not one expressing mprF alone, restored the production of L-PG and rescued the lysX mutant phenotypes, indicating that the expression of both proteins is required for LysX function. The lysX mutant also showed defective growth in mouse and guinea pig lungs and showed reduced pathology relative to wild type, indicating that LysX activity is required for full virulence. Together, our results suggest that LysX-mediated production of L-PG is necessary for the maintenance of optimal membrane integrity and for survival of the pathogen upon infection.
3 A novel virus that infecting hypovirulent strain XG36-1 of plant fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a notorious plant fungal pathogen which spreads across the world. Hypovirulence is a phenomenon where the virulence of fungal pathogens is decreased, even lost, due to mycovirus infection. The potential of hypoviruses for biological control of the chestnut blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) has attracted much interest, and has led to discovery of new hypovirulent strains in other fungi. A hypovirulent strain, strain XG36-1, was isolated from a typical lesion on the stem of rapeseed (Brassica napus) caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Strain XG36-1 grew on PDA very slowly (average 2.5 +/- 0.1 mm/d) with sectoring, and developed abnormal colony morphology with few sclerotia. Unlike health strains (such as wildtype strain XG-13), it was unable to induce lesions on detached leaves of rapeseed. Sclerotia of strain XG36-1 produced apothecia rarely. A sexual progeny test showed that the phenotypes of all 104 sexual progeny were not different from wildtype strain XG-13 which shows normal phenotype of S. sclerotiorum, and protoplast regeneration tests showed that 25.5% of the regenerants of strain XG36-1 were recovered fully. Furthermore, the hypovirulence and its associated traits could be transmitted to XG36-1A34R, a hygromycin-resistance gene labelled sexual progeny of strain XG36-1, by hyphal anastomosis. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation showed that the cytoplasm of strain XG36-1 was destroyed and granulated; the membranes of nuclei and mitochondria were disintegrated; and mitochondrial cristae were cavitated. Viral particles (about 40 nm) in hyphae of strain XG36-1, but not in its sexual progeny and wildtype strain XG-13, could be observed with TEM, and several virus-like particles were uniquely enveloped by single layer membrane in the cells of strain XG36-1. Furthermore, the viral particles could be co-transmitted with the hypovirulence traits through hyphal anastomosis. Hypovirulence and its associated traits of strain XG36-1 could be mediated by a fungal virus. Currently, we could not know the characteristic of this virus, but it likely represent a new type of mycovirus in S. sclerotiorum, and possibly in fungi.
1 Comparative expression profiling of Leishmania: modulation in gene expression between species and in different host genetic backgrounds. Genome sequencing of Leishmania species that give rise to a range of disease phenotypes in the host has revealed highly conserved gene content and synteny across the genus. Only a small number of genes are differentially distributed between the three species sequenced to date, L. major, L. infantum and L. braziliensis. It is not yet known how many of these genes are expressed in the disease-promoting intracellular amastigotes of these species or whether genes conserved between the species are differentially expressed in the host. We have used customised oligonucleotide microarrays to confirm that all of the differentially distributed genes identified by genome comparisons are expressed in intracellular amastigotes, with only a few of these subject to regulation at the RNA level. In the first large-scale study of gene expression in L. braziliensis, we show that only approximately 9% of the genes analysed are regulated in their RNA expression during the L. braziliensis life cycle, a figure consistent with that observed in other Leishmania species. Comparing amastigote gene expression profiles between species confirms the proposal that Leishmania transcriptomes undergo little regulation but also identifies conserved genes that are regulated differently between species in the host. We have also investigated whether host immune competence influences parasite gene expression, by comparing RNA expression profiles in L. major amastigotes derived from either wild-type (BALB/c) or immunologically compromised (Rag2(-/-) gamma(c) (-/-)) mice. While parasite dissemination from the site of infection is enhanced in the Rag2(-/-) gamma(c) (-/-) genetic background, parasite RNA expression profiles are unperturbed. These findings support the hypothesis that Leishmania amastigotes are pre-adapted for intracellular survival and undergo little dynamic modulation of gene expression at the RNA level. Species-specific parasite factors contributing to virulence and pathogenicity in the host may be limited to the products of a small number of differentially distributed genes or the differential regulation of conserved genes, either of which are subject to translational and/or post-translational controls.
1 Expression of therapeutic misconception amongst Egyptians: a qualitative pilot study. Studies have shown that research participants fail to appreciate the difference between research and medical care, labeling such phenomenon as a "therapeutic misconception" (TM). Since research activity involving human participants is increasing in the Middle East, qualitative research investigating aspects of TM is warranted. Our objective was to assess for the existence of therapeutic misconception amongst Egyptians. Study Tool: We developed a semi-structured interview guide to elicit the knowledge, attitudes, and perspectives of Egyptians regarding medical research. We recruited individuals from the outpatient settings (public and private) at Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt. Interviews were taped, transcribed, and translated. We analyzed the content of the transcribed text to identify the presence of a TM, defined in one of two ways: TM1 = inaccurate beliefs about how individualized care can be compromised by the procedures in the research and TM2 = inaccurate appraisal of benefit obtained from the research study. Our findings showed that a majority of participants (11/15) expressed inaccurate beliefs regarding the degree with which individualized care will be maintained in the research setting (TM1) and a smaller number of participants (5/15) manifested an unreasonable belief in the likelihood of benefits to be obtained from a research study (TM2). A total of 12 of the 15 participants were judged to have expressed a TM on either one of these bases. The presence of TM is not uncommon amongst Egyptian individuals. We recommend further qualitative studies investigating aspects of TM involving a larger sample size distinguished by different types of illnesses and socio-economic variables, as well as those who have and have not participated in clinical research.
1 The relation between endothelial dependent flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery and coronary collateral development - a cross sectional study. Endothelial dysfunction is thought to be a potential mechanism for the decreased presence of coronary collaterals. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between systemic endothelial function and the extent of coronary collaterals. We investigated the association between endothelial function assessed via flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery following reactive hyperemia and the extent of coronary collaterals graded from 0 to 3 according to Rentrop classification in a cohort of 171 consecutive patients who had high grade coronary stenosis or occlusion on their angiograms. Mean age was 61 years and 75% were males. Of the 171 patients 88 (51%) had well developed collaterals (grades of 2 or 3) whereas 83 (49%) had impaired collateral development (grades of 0 or 1). Patients with poor collaterals were significantly more likely to have diabetes (p = 0.001), but less likely to have used statins (p = 0.083). FMD measurements were not significantly different among good and poor collateral groups (11.5 +/- 5.6 vs. 10.4 +/- 6.2% respectively, p = 0.214). Nitroglycerin mediated dilation was also similar (13.4 +/- 5.9 vs. 12.8 +/- 6.5%, p = 0.521). No significant association was found between the extent of angiographically visible coronary collaterals and systemic endothelial function assessed by FMD of the brachial artery.
3 Analyzing the forces binding a restriction endonuclease to DNA using a synthetic nanopore. Restriction endonucleases are used prevalently in recombinant DNA technology because they bind so stably to a specific target sequence and, in the presence of cofactors, cleave double-helical DNA specifically at a target sequence at a high rate. Using synthetic nanopores along with molecular dynamics (MD), we have analyzed with atomic resolution how a prototypical restriction endonuclease, EcoRI, binds to the DNA target sequence--GAATTC--in the absence of a Mg(2+) ion cofactor. We have previously shown that there is a voltage threshold for permeation of DNA bound to restriction enzymes through a nanopore that is associated with a nanonewton force required to rupture the complex. By introducing mutations in the DNA, we now show that this threshold depends on the recognition sequence and scales linearly with the dissociation energy, independent of the pore geometry. To predict the effect of mutation in a base pair on the free energy of dissociation, MD is used to qualitatively rank the stability of bonds in the EcoRI-DNA complex. We find that the second base in the target sequence exhibits the strongest binding to the protein, followed by the third and first bases, with even the flanking sequence affecting the binding, corroborating our experiments.
0 Discovery of cis-elements between sorghum and rice using co-expression and evolutionary conservation. The spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression largely depends on the presence and absence of cis-regulatory sites in the promoter. In the economically highly important grass family, our knowledge of transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional networks is still very limited. With the completion of the sorghum genome and the available rice genome sequence, comparative promoter analyses now allow genome-scale detection of conserved cis-elements. In this study, we identified thousands of phylogenetic footprints conserved between orthologous rice and sorghum upstream regions that are supported by co-expression information derived from three different rice expression data sets. In a complementary approach, cis-motifs were discovered by their highly conserved co-occurrence in syntenic promoter pairs. Sequence conservation and matches to known plant motifs support our findings. Expression similarities of gene pairs positively correlate with the number of motifs that are shared by gene pairs and corroborate the importance of similar promoter architectures for concerted regulation. This strongly suggests that these motifs function in the regulation of transcript levels in rice and, presumably also in sorghum. Our work provides the first large-scale collection of cis-elements for rice and sorghum and can serve as a paradigm for cis-element analysis through comparative genomics in grasses in general.
0 Oxidative and nitrosative stress in the diaphragm of patients with COPD. COPD is associated with an increased load on the diaphragm. Since chronic muscle loading results in changes in antioxidant capacity and formation of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, we hypothesized that COPD has a similar effect on the diaphragm, which is related to the severity of COPD. Catalase activity was determined spectrophotometrically. Levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)-protein adducts and 3-nitrotyrosine (NT) formation were measured using western blotting. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. We found that catalase activity was approximately 89% higher in the diaphragm of severe COPD patients (FEV1 37+/-5% predicted) compared with non-COPD patients. MDA levels, a marker for lipid peroxidation, were significantly lower in the diaphragm of COPD patients compared with non-COPD patients, whereas the level of HNE-protein adducts was equal in both groups. NT formation was not different between groups. However, increasing hyperinflation and NT formation were inversely correlated. These results indicate that in COPD the diaphragm adapts to a higher work load by increasing catalase activity, resulting in a reduction in oxidative damage to lipids and tyrosine nitration of proteins.
0 Overexpression of the rhamnose catabolism regulatory protein, RhaR: a novel mechanism for metronidazole resistance in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The aim of the investigation was to use in vitro transposon mutagenesis to generate metronidazole resistance in the obligately anaerobic pathogenic bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and to identify the genes involved to enable investigation of potential mechanisms for the generation of metronidazole resistance. The genes affected by the transposon insertion were identified by plasmid rescue and sequencing. Expression levels of the relevant genes were determined by semi-quantitative RNA hybridization and catabolic activity by lactate dehydrogenase/pyruvate oxidoreductase assays. A metronidazole-resistant mutant was isolated and the transposon insertion site was identified in an intergenic region between the rhaO and rhaR genes of the gene cluster involved in the uptake and catabolism of rhamnose. Metronidazole resistance was observed during growth in defined medium containing either rhamnose or glucose. The metronidazole-resistant mutant showed improved growth in the presence of rhamnose as compared with the wild-type parent. There was increased transcription of all genes of the rhamnose gene cluster in the presence of rhamnose and glucose, likely due to the transposon providing an additional promoter for the rhaR gene, encoding the positive transcriptional regulator of the rhamnose operon. The B. thetaiotaomicron metronidazole resistance phenotype was recreated by overexpressing the rhaR gene in the B. thetaiotaomicron wild-type parent. Both the metronidazole-resistant transposon mutant and RhaR overexpression strains displayed a phenotype of higher lactate dehydrogenase and lower pyruvate oxidoreductase activity in comparison with the parent strain during growth in rhamnose. These data indicate that overexpression of the rhaR gene generates metronidazole resistance in B. thetaiotaomicron.
3 Do changes in pulse oximeter oxygen saturation predict equivalent changes in arterial oxygen saturation? This study investigates the relation between changes in pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2) and changes in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) in the critically ill, and the effects of acidosis and anaemia on precision of using pulse oximetry to predict SaO2. Forty-one consecutive patients were recruited from a nine-bed general intensive care unit into a 2-month study. Patients with significant jaundice (bilirubin >40 micromol/l) or inadequate pulse oximetry tracing were excluded. A total of 1085 paired readings demonstrated only moderate correlation (r= 0.606; P < 0.01) between changes in SpO2 and those in SaO2, and the pulse oximeter tended to overestimate actual changes in SaO2. Anaemia increased the degree of positive bias whereas acidosis reduced it. However, the magnitude of these changes was small. Changes in SpO2 do not reliably predict equivalent changes in SaO2 in the critically ill. Neither anaemia nor acidosis alters the relation between SpO2 and SaO2 to any clinically important extent.
2 Satisfaction and compliance in hormonal contraception: the result of a multicentre clinical study on women's experience with the ethinylestradiol/norelgestromin contraceptive patch in Italy. For many women finding the right contraceptive method can be challenging and consistent and correct use over a lifetime is difficult. Even remembering to take a birth control pill every day can be a challenge. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate women's experience with a weekly ethinylestradiol/norelgestromin contraceptive patch (EE/NGMN patch), given new technologies recently developed in hormonal contraception to increase women's options in avoiding daily dosing. In 24 Italian sites, 207 women received the EE/NGMN patch for up to 6 cycles. At study end, overall satisfaction and preference, as well as compliance, efficacy and safety, were evaluated. 175 women (84.5%) completed the study. The overall satisfaction rate was 88%; convenience and once-a-week frequency of the patch were especially appreciated. At baseline, 82 women (39.4%) were using a contraceptive method, mainly oral contraceptives and barrier methods, but only 45.1% were very satisfied/satisfied; after 6 months with the patch, 86.3% of this subset was very satisfied/satisfied. Considering the method used in the 3 months before the study entry, 78.1% strongly preferred/preferred the patch, for convenience (53.9%), ease of use/simplicity (28.9%), fewer (9.2%) and less severe (2.6%) side effects. Compliance was very high: 1034/1110 cycles (93.2%) were completed with perfect compliance and the mean subject's compliance score was 90%. One on-therapy pregnancy occurred. The patch was safe and well tolerated: adverse events frequency was low, with predominantly single reports of each event. Most of them started and subsided during cycle 1. This study demonstrated that the EE/NGMN patch is associated with high satisfaction levels and excellent compliance. At study end, the majority of women indicated that they would continue using the patch.
3 Bench-to-bedside review: severe lactic acidosis in HIV patients treated with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are effective antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV-infected patients. NRTIs can induce mitochondrial impairment that leads to a number of adverse events, including symptomatic lactic acidosis. In the present review, we describe the underlying mechanism of NRTI-induced toxicity and the main clinical features of this infrequent, but severe, emerging complication. We also summarise experimental data and clinical observations that support the use of L-carnitine supplementation to reverse NRTI-induced mitochondrial impairment.
0 NEMO oligomerization and its ubiquitin-binding properties. The IKK [IkappaB (inhibitory kappaB) kinase] complex is a key regulatory component of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) activation and is responsible for mediating the degradation of IkappaB, thereby allowing nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and transcription of target genes. NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator), the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, plays a pivotal role in this process by integrating upstream signals, in particular the recognition of polyubiquitin chains, and relaying these to the activation of IKKalpha and IKKbeta, the catalytic subunits of the IKK complex. The oligomeric state of NEMO is controversial and the mechanism by which it regulates activation of the IKK complex is poorly understood. Using a combination of hydrodynamic techniques we now show that apo-NEMO is a highly elongated, dimeric protein that is in weak equilibrium with a tetrameric assembly. Interaction with peptides derived from IKKbeta disrupts formation of the tetrameric NEMO complex, indicating that interaction with IKKalpha and IKKbeta and tetramerization are mutually exclusive. Furthermore, we show that NEMO binds to linear di-ubiquitin with a stoichiometry of one molecule of di-ubiquitin per NEMO dimer. This stoichiometry is preserved in a construct comprising the second coiled-coil region and the leucine zipper and in one that essentially spans the full-length protein. However, our data show that at high di-ubiquitin concentrations a second weaker binding site becomes apparent, implying that two different NEMO-di-ubiquitin complexes are formed during the IKK activation process. We propose that the role of these two complexes is to provide a threshold for activation, thereby ensuring sufficient specificity during NF-kappaB signalling.
1 Sequence characterization of the MC1R gene in yak (Poephagus grunniens) breeds with different coat colors. Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene plays a key role in determining coat color in several species, including the cattle. However, up to now there is no report regarding the MC1R gene and the potential association of its mutations with coat colors in yak (Poephagus grunniens). In this study, we sequenced the encoding region of the MC1R gene in three yak breeds with completely white (Tianzhu breed) or black coat color (Jiulong and Maiwa breeds). The predicted coding region of the yak MC1R gene resulted of 954 bp, the same to that of the wild-type cattle sequence, with >99% identity. None of the mutation events reported in cattle was found. Comparing the yak obtained sequences, five nucleotide substitutions were detected, which defined three haplotypes (E(Y1), E(Y2), and E(Y3)). Of the five mutations, two, characterizing the E(Y1) haplotype, were nonsynonymous substitutions (c.340C>A and c.871G>A) causing amino acid changes located in the first extracellular loop (p.Q114K) and in the seventh transmembrane region (p.A291T). In silico prediction might indicate a functional effect of the latter substitution. However, all three haplotypes were present in the three yak breeds with relatively consistent frequency distribution, despite of their distinguished coat colors, which suggested that there was no across-breed association between haplotypes or genotypes and black/white phenotypes, at least in the investigated breeds. Other genes may be involved in affecting coat color in the analyzed yaks.
0 Adherence to the DASH Diet is inversely associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes: the insulin resistance atherosclerosis study. OBJECTIVE The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been widely promoted; however, little is known about its impact on type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We evaluated the association of the DASH diet with incidence of type 2 diabetes among 862 participants of the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) who completed a 1-year food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Type 2 diabetes odds ratios (ORs) were estimated at tertiles of the DASH score. RESULTS An inverse association was observed in whites (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1, OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.29-1.48]) that became significant for the most extreme contrast (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1, 0.31 [0.13-0.75]), with adjustment for covariates. No association was observed in blacks or Hispanics (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1, 1.16 [0.61-2.18 ]; tertile 3 vs. tertile 1, 1.34 [0.70-2.58 ]). CONCLUSIONS Adherence to the DASH dietary pattern, which is rich in vegetables, fruit, and low-fat dairy products, may have the potential to prevent type 2 diabetes.
2 Angiographically negative acute arterial upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding: incidence, predictive factors, and clinical outcomes. To evaluate the incidence, predictive factors, and clinical outcomes of angiographically negative acute arterial upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. From 2001 to 2008, 143 consecutive patients who underwent an angiography for acute arterial upper or lower GI bleeding were examined. The angiographies revealed a negative bleeding focus in 75 of 143 (52%) patients. The incidence of an angiographically negative outcome was significantly higher in patients with a stable hemodynamic status (p < 0.001), or in patients with lower GI bleeding (p = 0.032). A follow-up of the 75 patients (range: 0-72 months, mean: 8 +/- 14 months) revealed that 60 of the 75 (80%) patients with a negative bleeding focus underwent conservative management only, and acute bleeding was controlled without rebleeding. Three of the 75 (4%) patients underwent exploratory surgery due to prolonged bleeding; however, no bleeding focus was detected. Rebleeding occurred in 12 of 75 (16%) patients. Of these, six patients experienced massive rebleeding and died of disseminated intravascular coagulation within four to nine hours after the rebleeding episode. Four of the 16 patients underwent a repeat angiography and the two remaining patients underwent a surgical intervention to control the bleeding. Angiographically negative results are relatively common in patients with acute GI bleeding, especially in patients with a stable hemodynamic status or lower GI bleeding. Most patients with a negative bleeding focus have experienced spontaneous resolution of their condition.
0 Effect of chlorotriphenyl derivatives of Sn and Pb upon biophysical properties of membranes. Biophysical activity of two twin organometallic compounds Triphenyltin chloride (TPhT) and Triphenyllead chloride (TPhL) in their interreaction with model membranes, as well as with yeast cells Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was investigated. Four measurement methods were used in the experiments: two physical methods (spin probes method and the electric method); two biological methods (minimal inhibitory concentration /MIC/ and yeast survival test). It has been found that the activity of TPhT in interaction with model membranes and yeast cells is distinctly greater than that of TPhL. The activity manifests itself by considerable increase in the fluidity of the middle part of liposome bilayer, change in the polarization direction of the transmembrane voltage of filters impregnated with lauric acid, and in complete inhibition of growth of yeast cells at the concentration of 5 microg/mL.
3 Hair sheep blood, citrated or defibrinated, fulfills all requirements of blood agar for diagnostic microbiology laboratory tests. Blood agar is used for the identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of many bacterial pathogens. In the developing world, microbiologists use human blood agar because of the high cost and inhospitable conditions for raising wool sheep or horses to supply blood. Many pathogens either fail to grow entirely or exhibit morphologies and hemolytic patterns on human blood agar that confound colony recognition. Furthermore, human blood can be hazardous to handle due to HIV and hepatitis. This study investigated whether blood from hair sheep, a hardy, low-maintenance variety of sheep adapted for hot climates, was suitable for routine clinical microbiology studies. Hair sheep blood obtained by jugular venipuncture was anticoagulated by either manual defibrination or collection in human blood bank bags containing citrate-phosphate-dextrose. Trypticase soy 5% blood agar was made from both forms of hair sheep blood and commercial defibrinated wool sheep blood. Growth characteristics, colony morphologies, and hemolytic patterns of selected human pathogens, including several streptococcal species, were evaluated. Specialized identification tests, including CAMP test, reverse CAMP test, and satellite colony formation with Haemophilus influenzae and Abiotrophia defectiva were also performed. Mueller-Hinton blood agar plates prepared from the three blood types were compared in antibiotic susceptibility tests by disk diffusion and E-test. The results of all studies showed that blood agar prepared from citrated hair sheep blood is suitable for microbiological tests used in routine identification and susceptibility profiling of human pathogens. The validation of citrated hair sheep blood eliminates the labor-intensive and equipment-requiring process of manual defibrination. Use of hair sheep blood, in lieu of human blood currently used by many developing world laboratories and as an alternative to cost-prohibitive commercial sheep blood, offers the opportunity to dramatically improve the safety and accuracy of laboratory diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria in resource-poor countries.
1 Chronology of islet differentiation revealed by temporal cell labeling. Neurogenin 3 plays a pivotal role in pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Whereas mouse models expressing reporters such as eGFP or LacZ under the control of the Neurog3 gene enable us to label cells in the pancreatic endocrine lineage, the long half-life of most reporter proteins makes it difficult to distinguish cells actively expressing neurogenin 3 from differentiated cells that have stopped transcribing the gene. In order to separate the transient neurogenin 3 -expressing endocrine progenitor cells from the differentiating endocrine cells, we developed a mouse model (Ngn3-Timer) in which DsRed-E5, a fluorescent protein that shifts its emission spectrum from green to red over time, was expressed transgenically from the NEUROG3 locus. In the Ngn3-Timer embryos, green-dominant cells could be readily detected by microscopy or flow cytometry and distinguished from green/red double-positive cells. When fluorescent cells were sorted into three different populations by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, placed in culture, and then reanalyzed by flow cytometry, green-dominant cells converted to green/red double-positive cells within 6 h. The sorted cell populations were then used to determine the temporal patterns of expression for 145 transcriptional regulators in the developing pancreas. The precise temporal resolution of this model defines the narrow window of neurogenin 3 expression in islet progenitor cells and permits sequential analyses of sorted cells as well as the testing of gene regulatory models for the differentiation of pancreatic islet cells.
2 A 3-portal approach for arthroscopic subtalar arthrodesis. We present a 3-portal approach for arthroscopic subtalar arthrodesis with the patient in the prone position. The prone position allows the use of the two standard posterior portals and it allows for accurate control of hindfoot alignment during surgery. Furthermore, the introduction of talocalcaneal lag screws is easy with the patient in this position. In addition to the standard posterior portals, an accessory third portal is created at the level of the sinus tarsi for introduction of a large diameter blunt trocar to open up the subtalar joint. Due to the curved geometry of the posterior subtalar joint, removal of the anterior articular cartilage is impossible by means of the posterior portals only. An advantage of the 3-portal approach is that ring curettes can be introduced through the accessory sinus tarsi portal to remove the articular cartilage of the anterior part of the posterior talocalcaneal joint. Arthroscopic subtalar arthrodesis in patients with a talocalcaneal coalition presents a technical challenge as the subtalar joint space is limited. The 3-portal technique was successfully used in three subsequent patients with a talocalcaneal coalition; bony union of the subtalar arthrodesis occurred at 6 weeks following surgery. With the 3-portal technique, a safe and time-efficient arthroscopic subtalar arthrodesis can be performed even in cases with limited subtalar joint space such as in symptomatic talocalcaneal coalition.
0 Science review: apoptosis in acute lung injury. Apoptosis is a process of controlled cellular death whereby the activation of specific death-signaling pathways leads to deletion of cells from tissue. The importance of apoptosis resides in the fact that several steps involved in the modulation of apoptosis are susceptible to therapeutic intervention. In the present review we examine two important hypotheses that link apoptosis with the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in humans. The first of these, namely the 'neutrophilic hypothesis', suggests that during acute inflammation the cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor prolong the survival of neutrophils, and thus enhance neutrophilic inflammation. The second hypothesis, the 'epithelial hypothesis', suggests that epithelial injury in acute lung injury is associated with apoptotic death of alveolar epithelial cells triggered by soluble mediators such as soluble Fas ligand. We also review recent studies that suggest that the rate of clearance of apoptotic neutrophils may be associated with resolution of neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs, and data showing that phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils can induce an anti-inflammatory phenotype in activated alveolar macrophages.
0 An experimental analysis of body checking. The relationship between repeated body checking and its impact on body size estimation and body dissatisfaction is of interest for two reasons. First, it has importance in theoretical accounts of the maintenance of eating disorders and, second, body checking is targeted in cognitive-behavioural treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of manipulating body checking on body size estimation and body dissatisfaction. Sixty women were randomly assigned either to repeatedly scrutinize their bodies in a critical way in the mirror ("high body checking") or to refrain from body checking but to examine the whole of their bodies in a neutral way ("low body checking"). Body dissatisfaction, feelings of fatness and the strength of a particular self-critical thought increased immediately after the manipulation among those in the high body checking condition. Feelings of fatness decreased among those in the low body checking condition. These changes were short-lived. The manipulation did not effect estimations of body size or the discrepancy between estimations of body size and desired body size. The implications of these findings for understanding the influence of body checking on the maintenance of body dissatisfaction are considered.

0 Domain swapping reveals that the N-terminal domain of the sensor kinase KdpD in Escherichia coli is important for signaling. The KdpD/KdpE two-component system of Escherichia coli regulates expression of the kdpFABC operon encoding the high affinity K+ transport system KdpFABC. The input domain of KdpD comprises a domain that belongs to the family of universal stress proteins (Usp). It has been previously demonstrated that UspC binds to this domain, resulting in KdpD/KdpE scaffolding under salt stress. However the mechanistic significance of this domain for signaling remains unclear. Here, we employed a "domain swapping" approach to replace the KdpD-Usp domain with four homologous domains or with the six soluble Usp proteins of E. coli. Full response to salt stress was only achieved with a chimera that contains UspC, probably due to unaffected scaffolding of the KdpD/KdpE signaling cascade by soluble UspC. Unexpectedly, chimeras containing either UspF or UspG not only prevented kdpFABC expression under salt stress but also under K+ limiting conditions, although these hybrid proteins exhibited kinase and phosphotransferase activities in vitro. These are the first KdpD derivatives that do not respond to K+ limitation due to alterations in the N-terminal domain. Analysis of the KdpD-Usp tertiary structure revealed that this domain has a net positively charged surface, while UspF and UspG are characterized by net negative surface charges. The Usp domain within KdpD not only functions as a binding surface for the scaffold UspC, but it is also important for KdpD signaling. We propose that KdpD sensing/signaling involves alterations of electrostatic interactions between the large N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains.
1 Visual awareness, emotion, and gamma band synchronization. What makes us become aware? A popular hypothesis is that if cortical neurons fire in synchrony at a certain frequency band (gamma), we become aware of what they are representing. We tested this hypothesis adopting brain-imaging techniques with good spatiotemporal resolution and frequency-specific information. Specifically, we examined the degree to which increases in event-related synchronization (ERS) in the gamma band were associated with awareness of a stimulus (its detectability) and/or the emotional content of the stimulus. We observed increases in gamma band ERS within prefrontal-anterior cingulate, visual, parietal, posterior cingulate, and superior temporal cortices to stimuli available to conscious awareness. However, we also observed increases in gamma band ERS within the amygdala, visual, prefrontal, parietal, and posterior cingulate cortices to emotional relative to neutral stimuli, irrespective of their availability to conscious access. This suggests that increased gamma band ERS is related to, but not sufficient for, consciousness.
2 Vaccination with recombinant oncosphere antigens reduces the susceptibility of sheep to infection with Taenia multiceps. Taenia multiceps is a cestode parasite, the larval stage of which encysts in the brain of sheep, goats and cattle causing an often fatal condition. The parasite also causes zoonotic infections in humans. Homologues of the recombinant oncosphere vaccine antigens from Taenia ovis and other Taenia species were identified in T. multiceps. Sequencing of the associated T. multiceps genes and cloning of the encoding mRNA has revealed conserved features in the genes and proteins. The T. multiceps oncosphere proteins, designated Tm16 and Tm18, contain a predicted secretory signal and fibronectin type III domain. The recombinant Tm16 and Tm18 proteins were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with GST. The antigens, formulated with Quil A adjuvant, were tested in a vaccine trial in sheep. The antigens stimulated immunity in sheep against challenge infection with T. multiceps eggs. Five of nine control sheep died due to a challenge infection with T. multiceps whereas none of 20 vaccinated animals died as a result of the parasite challenge (P=0.001). In addition, vaccination with the Tm16 protein, or Tm16 plus Tm18, induced significant protection against the number of parasites encysting in the brain as a result of the challenge infection (P=0.023, P=0.015, respectively). No clear relationship was apparent between the level of specific serum antibody in vaccinated animals and either the presence or absence of parasites or the number of parasites that occurred in some of the vaccinated animals. We believe this study is the first description of recombinant vaccine-related investigations for T. multiceps. The recombinant oncosphere antigens identified may allow development of effective vaccination strategies against T. multiceps infection in sheep. They raise the potential for the development of a combined vaccine with the Echinococcus granulosus EG95 antigen for prevention of T. multiceps as well as preventing the transmission of cystic hydatid disease.
1 Integrating sequencing technologies in personal genomics: optimal low cost reconstruction of structural variants. The goal of human genome re-sequencing is obtaining an accurate assembly of an individual's genome. Recently, there has been great excitement in the development of many technologies for this (e.g. medium and short read sequencing from companies such as 454 and SOLiD, and high-density oligo-arrays from Affymetrix and NimbelGen), with even more expected to appear. The costs and sensitivities of these technologies differ considerably from each other. As an important goal of personal genomics is to reduce the cost of re-sequencing to an affordable point, it is worthwhile to consider optimally integrating technologies. Here, we build a simulation toolbox that will help us optimally combine different technologies for genome re-sequencing, especially in reconstructing large structural variants (SVs). SV reconstruction is considered the most challenging step in human genome re-sequencing. (It is sometimes even harder than de novo assembly of small genomes because of the duplications and repetitive sequences in the human genome.) To this end, we formulate canonical problems that are representative of issues in reconstruction and are of small enough scale to be computationally tractable and simulatable. Using semi-realistic simulations, we show how we can combine different technologies to optimally solve the assembly at low cost. With mapability maps, our simulations efficiently handle the inhomogeneous repeat-containing structure of the human genome and the computational complexity of practical assembly algorithms. They quantitatively show how combining different read lengths is more cost-effective than using one length, how an optimal mixed sequencing strategy for reconstructing large novel SVs usually also gives accurate detection of SNPs/indels, how paired-end reads can improve reconstruction efficiency, and how adding in arrays is more efficient than just sequencing for disentangling some complex SVs. Our strategy should facilitate the sequencing of human genomes at maximum accuracy and low cost.
0 DIANA-microT web server: elucidating microRNA functions through target prediction. Computational microRNA (miRNA) target prediction is one of the key means for deciphering the role of miRNAs in development and disease. Here, we present the DIANA-microT web server as the user interface to the DIANA-microT 3.0 miRNA target prediction algorithm. The web server provides extensive information for predicted miRNA:target gene interactions with a user-friendly interface, providing extensive connectivity to online biological resources. Target gene and miRNA functions may be elucidated through automated bibliographic searches and functional information is accessible through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The web server offers links to nomenclature, sequence and protein databases, and users are facilitated by being able to search for targeted genes using different nomenclatures or functional features, such as the genes possible involvement in biological pathways. The target prediction algorithm supports parameters calculated individually for each miRNA:target gene interaction and provides a signal-to-noise ratio and a precision score that helps in the evaluation of the significance of the predicted results. Using a set of miRNA targets recently identified through the pSILAC method, the performance of several computational target prediction programs was assessed. DIANA-microT 3.0 achieved there with 66% the highest ratio of correctly predicted targets over all predicted targets. The DIANA-microT web server is freely available at www.microrna.gr/microT.
0 Involvement of the post-transcriptional regulator Hfq in Yersinia pestis virulence. Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague, which is transmitted primarily between fleas and mammals and is spread to humans through the bite of an infected flea or contact with afflicted animals. Hfq is proposed to be a global post-transcriptional regulator that acts by mediating interactions between many regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) and their mRNA targets. Sequence comparisons revealed that Y. pestis appears to produce a functional homologue of E. coli Hfq. Phenotype comparisons using in vitro assays demonstrated that Y. pestis Hfq was involved in resistance to H(2)O(2), heat and polymyxin B and contributed to growth under nutrient-limiting conditions. The role of Hfq in Y. pestis virulence was also assessed using macrophage and mouse infection models, and the gene expression affected by Hfq was determined using microarray-based transcriptome and real time PCR analysis. The macrophage infection assay showed that the Y. pestis hfq deletion strain did not have any significant difference in its ability to associate with J774A.1 macrophage cells. However, hfq deletion appeared to significantly impair the ability of Y. pestis to resist phagocytosis and survive within macrophages at the initial stage of infection. Furthermore, the hfq deletion strain was highly attenuated in mice after subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Transcriptome analysis supported the results concerning the attenuated phenotype of the hfq mutant and showed that the deletion of the hfq gene resulted in significant alterations in mRNA abundance of 243 genes in more than 13 functional classes, about 23% of which are known or hypothesized to be involved in stress resistance and virulence. Our results indicate that Hfq is a key regulator involved in Y. pestis stress resistance, intracellular survival and pathogenesis. It appears that Hfq acts by controlling the expression of many virulence- and stress-associated genes, probably in conjunction with small noncoding RNAs.
1 Introducing robustness to maximum-likelihood refinement of electron-microscopy data. An expectation-maximization algorithm for maximum-likelihood refinement of electron-microscopy images is presented that is based on fitting mixtures of multivariate t-distributions. The novel algorithm has intrinsic characteristics for providing robustness against atypical observations in the data, which is illustrated using an experimental test set with artificially generated outliers. Tests on experimental data revealed only minor differences in two-dimensional classifications, while three-dimensional classification with the new algorithm gave stronger elongation factor G density in the corresponding class of a structurally heterogeneous ribosome data set than the conventional algorithm for Gaussian mixtures.
3 The Yb protein defines a novel organelle and regulates male germline stem cell self-renewal in Drosophila melanogaster. Yb regulates the proliferation of both germline and somatic stem cells in the Drosophila melanogaster ovary by activating piwi and hh expression in niche cells. In this study, we show that Yb protein is localized as discrete cytoplasmic spots exclusively in the somatic cells of the ovary and testis. These spots, which are different from all known cytoplasmic structures in D. melanogaster, are evenly electron-dense spheres 1.5 microm in diameter (herein termed the Yb body). The Yb body is frequently associated with mitochondria and a less electron-dense sphere of similar size that appears to be RNA rich. There are one to two Yb bodies/cell, often located close to germline cells. The N-terminal region of Yb is required for hh expression in niche cells, whereas the C-terminal region is required for localization to Yb bodies. The entire Yb protein is necessary for piwi expression in niche cells. A double mutant of Yb and a novel locus show male germline loss, revealing a function for Yb in male germline stem cell maintenance.
0 Germline and somatic cancer-associated mutations in the ATP-binding motifs of PTEN influence its subcellular localization and tumor suppressive function. Germline and somatic PTEN mutations are found in Cowden syndrome (CS) and multiple sporadic malignancies, respectively. PTEN function appears to be modulated by subcellular compartmentalization, and mislocalization may affect function. We have shown that cellular ATP levels affect nuclear PTEN levels. Here, we examined the ATP-binding capabilities of PTEN and functional consequences, relevant to cancer-associated mutations. PTEN mutation analysis of CS patients and sporadic colorectal carcinomas and comparative aminoacid analysis were utilized to identify mutations in ATP-binding motifs. The ability of wild-type (WT) or mutant PTEN to bind ATP was assessed by ATP-agarose-binding assays. Subcellular fractionation, western blotting, confocal microscopy and growth assays were used to determine relative nuclear-cytoplasmic localization and function. Somatic colorectal carcinoma-derived PTEN missense mutations were associated with nuclear mislocalization. These mutations altered cellular proliferation, apoptosis and anchorage-dependent growth. Examination of PTEN's amino acid sequence revealed these mutations resided in previously undescribed ATP-binding motifs (c.60-73; c.122-136). In contrast to WT PTEN, both cancer-associated somatic and germline-derived PTEN missense mutations, which lie within the ATP-binding motifs, result in mutant PTEN that does not bind ATP efficiently. We also show that CS patients with germline ATP-binding motif-mutations had nuclear PTEN mislocalization. Of four unrelated patients with functional germline ATP-binding domain mutations, all three female patients had breast cancers. Germline and somatic mutations within PTEN's ATP-binding domain play important pathogenic roles in both heritable and sporadic carcinogenesis by PTEN nuclear mislocalization resulting in altered signaling and growth. Manipulation of ATP may represent novel therapies in tumors with such PTEN alterations.
1 The INSIG2 rs7566605 genetic variant does not play a major role in obesity in a sample of 24,722 individuals from four cohorts. In a genome-wide association study performed in the Framingham Offspring Cohort, individuals homozygous for the rs7566605 C allele located upstream of insulin-induced gene 2 (INSIG2) were reported to incur an increased risk of obesity. This finding was later replicated in four out of five populations examined. The goal of the study reported here was to assess the role of the INSIG2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in susceptibility to obesity in the prospective longitudinal Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (n = 14,566) and in three other cohorts: the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (n = 3,888), the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study (n = 4,766), and extremely obese and lean individuals ascertained at the University of Ottawa (n = 1,502). The combined study sample is comprised of 24,722 white, African-American, and Mexican-American participants. Differences in mean body mass index (BMI) and other anthropometric measures including weight, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio were assessed by a general linear model in individuals categorized by INSIG2 rs7566605 genotype. Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the risk of obesity (BMI >or= 30 kg/m2). There was no discernable variation in the frequencies of the three INSIG2 SNP genotypes observed between white, Hispanic, and African-American obese individuals and non-obese study subjects. When the relationship between rs7566605 and BMI considered either as a categorical variable or a continuous variable was examined, no significant association with obesity was found for participants in any of the four study populations or in a combined analysis (p = 0.38) under a recessive genetic model. There was also no association between the INSIG2 polymorphism and the obesity-related quantitative traits except for a reduced waist-to-hip ratio in white ARIC study participants homozygous for the C allele, and an increased waist-to-hip ratio in African-Americans in the ARIC cohort with the same genotype (p = 0.04 and p = 0.01, respectively). An association with waist-to-hip ratio was not seen when the combined study sample was analyzed (p = 0.74). These results suggest that the INSIG2 rs7566605 variant does not play a major role in determining obesity risk in a racially and ethnically diverse sample of 24,722 individuals from four cohorts.
0 Transcription, chromatin condensation, and gene migration. The binding of fluorescently tagged proteins to tandem DNA arrays has been instrumental in understanding nuclear organization and function. Through the use of more natural tandem DNA arrays, Hu et al. (Hu, Y., I. Kireev, M. Plutz, N. Ashourian, and A.S. Belmont. 2009. J. Cell Biol. 185:87-100) gain new insights into chromatin organization and dynamics, and into the association of splicing factors with active genes.
1 Antineoplastic effect of iodine in mammary cancer: participation of 6-iodolactone (6-IL) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR). Studies in mammary cancer demonstrated that moderately high concentrations of molecular iodine (I2) have a antiproliferative and apoptotic effect either in vivo as in vitro, however the cellular intermediated involved in these effects has not been elucidated. Virgin Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with methyl-nitrosourea (MNU: single dose ip, 50 mg/Kg bw) and the participation of arachidonic acid (AA) and PPAR receptors in the antineoplasic effect of I2 where analyzed. I2-treated rats for four weeks exhibited a significant reduction in the incidence (62.5 vs. 100%) and size (0.87 +/- 0.98 vs 1.96 +/- 1.5 cm3) of mammary tumors. HPLC analysis showed that tumoral but not normal mammary tissue contained an elevated basal concentration of AA and significantly more AA-iodinated called 6-iodolactone (6-IL) after chronic I2 treatment. Tumors from I2-treated rats showed fewer cells positive to proliferating cell nuclear antigen, lower blood vessel density, as well as decreases in vascular endothelial growth factor, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and PPAR type alpha (PPARalpha). These same tumors showed increases in the cell death markers, TUNEL-positive cells (p < 0.05) and the enzyme caspase-3 (trend), as well as significant induction of PPAR type gamma (PPARgamma). Together, these data demonstrate that the antineoplasic effect of iodine involves 6-IL formation and PPARgamma induction.
0 Acetylation and activation of STAT3 mediated by nuclear translocation of CD44. Expression of the type I transmembrane glycoprotein CD44 has recently been recognized as a signature for cancer stem cells. In this study, we demonstrate that CD44, once engaged, is internalized and translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to various promoters, including that of cyclin D1, leading to cell fate change through transcriptional reprogramming. In regulating cyclin D1 expression, the internalized CD44 forms a complex with STAT3 and p300 (acetyltransferase), eliciting STAT3 acetylation at lysine 685 and dimer formation in a cytokine- and growth factor-independent manner. A bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) was mapped to the cytoplasmic tail of CD44, which mediates its nuclear translocation. Expression of CD44(NLS) mutant sequesters STAT3 in cytosol. In the nucleus, the acetylated STAT3 dimer remains associated with CD44 and binds to the cyclin D1 promoter, leading to increased cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation. This study describes a novel function for CD44 in transcriptional modulation through nuclear translocation of the internalized CD44 and complex formation with transcription factors.
1 Word-based characterization of promoters involved in human DNA repair pathways. DNA repair genes provide an important contribution towards the surveillance and repair of DNA damage. These genes produce a large network of interacting proteins whose mRNA expression is likely to be regulated by similar regulatory factors. Full characterization of promoters of DNA repair genes and the similarities among them will more fully elucidate the regulatory networks that activate or inhibit their expression. To address this goal, the authors introduce a technique to find regulatory genomic signatures, which represents a specific application of the genomic signature methodology to classify DNA sequences as putative functional elements within a single organism. The effectiveness of the regulatory genomic signatures is demonstrated via analysis of promoter sequences for genes in DNA repair pathways of humans. The promoters are divided into two classes, the bidirectional promoters and the unidirectional promoters, and distinct genomic signatures are calculated for each class. The genomic signatures include statistically overrepresented words, word clusters, and co-occurring words. The robustness of this method is confirmed by the ability to identify sequences that exist as motifs in TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases, and in overlap with verified binding sites in this set of promoter regions. The word-based signatures are shown to be effective by finding occurrences of known regulatory sites. Moreover, the signatures of the bidirectional and unidirectional promoters of human DNA repair pathways are clearly distinct, exhibiting virtually no overlap. In addition to providing an effective characterization method for related DNA sequences, the signatures elucidate putative regulatory aspects of DNA repair pathways, which are notably under-characterized.
1 Risk factors for virological failure and subtherapeutic antiretroviral drug concentrations in HIV-positive adults treated in rural northwestern Uganda. Little is known about immunovirological treatment outcomes and adherence in HIV/AIDS patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated using a simplified management approach in rural areas of developing countries, or about the main factors influencing those outcomes in clinical practice. Cross-sectional immunovirological, pharmacological, and adherence outcomes were evaluated in all patients alive and on fixed-dose ART combinations for 24 months, and in a random sample of those treated for 12 months. Risk factors for virological failure (>1,000 copies/ml) and subtherapeutic antiretroviral (ARV) concentrations were investigated with multiple logistic regression. At 12 and 24 months of ART, 72% (n = 701) and 70% (n = 369) of patients, respectively, were alive and in care. About 8% and 38% of patients, respectively, were diagnosed with immunological failure; and 75% and 72% of patients, respectively, had undetectable HIV RNA (<400 copies/ml). Risk factors for virological failure (>1,000 copies/ml) were poor adherence, tuberculosis diagnosed after ART initiation, subtherapeutic NNRTI concentrations, general clinical symptoms, and lower weight than at baseline. About 14% of patients had low ARV plasma concentrations. Digestive symptoms and poor adherence to ART were risk factors for low ARV plasma concentrations. Efforts to improve both access to care and patient management to achieve better immunological and virological outcomes on ART are necessary to maximize the duration of first-line therapy.
0 Alternative splicing of NURF301 generates distinct NURF chromatin remodeling complexes with altered modified histone binding specificities. Drosophila NURF is an ISWI-containing chromatin remodeling complex that catalyzes ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding. By sliding nucleosomes, NURF can alter chromatin structure and regulate transcription. NURF301/BPTF is the only NURF-specific subunit of NURF and is instrumental in recruiting the complex to target genes. Here we demonstrate that three NURF301 isoforms are expressed and that these encode functionally distinct NURF chromatin remodeling complexes. Full-length NURF301 contains a C-terminal bromodomain and juxtaposed PHD finger that bind histone H3 trimethylated at Lys4 (H3K4me3) and histone H4 acetylated at Lys16 (H4K16Ac) respectively. However, a NURF301 isoform that lacks these C-terminal domains is also detected. This truncated NURF301 isoform assembles a complex containing ISWI, NURF55, and NURF38, indicating that a second class of NURF remodeling complex, deficient in H3K4me3 and H4K16Ac recognition, exists. By comparing microarray expression profiles and phenotypes of null Nurf301 mutants with mutants that remove the C-terminal PHD fingers and bromodomain, we show that full-length NURF301 is not essential for correct expression of the majority of NURF gene targets in larvae. However, full-length NURF301 is required for spermatogenesis. Mutants that lack full-length NURF exhibit a spermatocyte arrest phenotype and fail to express a subset of spermatid differentiation genes. Our data reveal that variants of the NURF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that recognize post-translational histone modifications are important regulators of primary spermatocyte differentiation in Drosophila.
2 Regeneration of the pancreas in adult zebrafish. Regenerating organs in diverse biological systems have provided clues to processes that can be harnessed to repair damaged tissue. Adult mammalian beta-cells have a limited capacity to regenerate, resulting in diabetes and lifelong reliance on insulin. Zebrafish have been used as a model for the regeneration of many organs. We demonstrate the regeneration of adult zebrafish pancreatic beta-cells. This nonmammalian model can be used to define pathways for islet-cell regeneration in humans. Adult transgenic zebrafish were injected with a single high dose of streptozotocin or metronidazole and anesthetized at 3, 7, or 14 days or pancreatectomized. Blood glucose measurements were determined and gut sections were analyzed using specific endocrine, exocrine, and duct cell markers as well as markers for dividing cells. Zebrafish recovered rapidly without the need for insulin injections, and normoglycemia was attained within 2 weeks. Although few proliferating cells were present in vehicles, ablation caused islet destruction and a striking increase of proliferating cells, some of which were Pdx1 positive. Dividing cells were primarily associated with affected islets and ducts but, with the exception of surgical partial pancreatectomy, were not extensively beta-cells. The ability of the zebrafish to regenerate a functional pancreas using chemical, genetic, and surgical approaches enabled us to identify patterns of cell proliferation in islets and ducts. Further study of the origin and contribution of proliferating cells in reestablishing islet function could provide strategies for treating human diseases.
1 Type IV collagen is a tumour stroma-derived biomarker for pancreas cancer. Pancreas cancer is a dreaded disease with high mortality, despite progress in surgical and oncological treatments in recent years. The field is hampered by a lack of good prognostic and predictive tumour biomarkers to be used during follow-up of patients. The circulating level of type IV collagen was measured by ELISA in pancreas cancer patients and controls. The expression pattern of type IV collagen in normal pancreas, pancreas cancer tissue and in pancreas cancer cell lines was studied by immunofluorescence and Western blot techniques. Patients with pancreas cancer have significantly increased circulating levels of type IV collagen. In pancreas cancer tissue high levels of type IV collagen expression was found in close proximity to cancer cells in the tumour stroma. Furthermore, pancreas cancer cells were found to produce and secrete type IV collagen in vitro, which in part can explain the high type IV collagen expression observed in pancreas cancer tissue, and the increased circulating levels in pancreas cancer patients. Of clinical importance, our results show that the circulating level of type IV collagen after surgery is strongly related to prognosis in patients treated for pancreas cancer by pancreatico-duodenectomy with curative intent. Persisting high levels of circulating type IV collagen after surgery indicates a quick relapse in disease and poor survival. Our results most importantly show that stroma related substances can be evaluated as potential cancer biomarkers, and thereby underline the importance of the tumour microenvironment also in this context.
2 Effectiveness of a community-based multifaceted fall-prevention intervention in active and independent older Chinese adults. To evaluate the effectiveness of an 18-month multifaceted intervention designed to reduce the incidence of falls in community-living older adults in China. A population-based community trial evaluated by before-and-after cross-sectional surveys. Four residential communities were randomised to either a multifaceted intervention or a control condition. Baseline information was collected from a sample of older adults in each community. A 1-year annual fall rate was calculated after an 18-month comprehensive intervention. After intervention, 7.19% of the intervention community sample reported falls, compared with 17.86% of the control community sample (p<0.000). The annual fall rate decreased by 10.52% in the intervention communities, whereas the difference in control communities was not statistically significant. Multifaceted interventions in community settings may be useful in preventing falls among older people, and can be applied in similar settings in China.
3 IC50-to-Ki: a web-based tool for converting IC50 to Ki values for inhibitors of enzyme activity and ligand binding. A new web-server tool estimates K(i) values from experimentally determined IC(50) values for inhibitors of enzymes and of binding reactions between macromolecules (e.g. proteins, polynucleic acids) and ligands. This converter was developed to enable end users to help gauge the quality of the underlying assumptions used in these calculations which depend on the type of mechanism of inhibitor action and the concentrations of the interacting molecular species. Additional calculations are performed for nonclassical, tightly bound inhibitors of enzyme-substrate or of macromolecule-ligand systems in which free, rather than total concentrations of the reacting species are required. Required user-defined input values include the total enzyme (or another target molecule) and substrate (or ligand) concentrations, the K(m) of the enzyme-substrate (or the K(d) of the target-ligand) reaction, and the IC(50) value. Assumptions and caveats for these calculations are discussed along with examples taken from the literature. The host database for this converter contains kinetic constants and other data for inhibitors of the proteolytic clostridial neurotoxins (http://botdb.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/toxin/kiConverter.jsp).
3 Gsalpha signalling suppresses PPARgamma2 generation and inhibits 3T3L1 adipogenesis. Since TSH receptor (TSHR) expression increases during adipogenesis and signals via cAMP/phospho-cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), reported to be necessary and sufficient for adipogenesis, we hypothesised that TSHR activation would induce preadipocyte differentiation. Retroviral vectors introduced constitutively active TSHR (TSHR*) into 3T3L1 preadipocytes; despite increased cAMP (RIA) and phospho-CREB (western blot) there was no spontaneous adipogenesis (assessed morphologically, using oil red O and QPCR measurement of adipogenesis markers). We speculated that Gbetagamma signalling may be inhibitory but failed to induce adipogenesis using activated Gsalpha (gsp*). Inhibition of phosphodiesterases did not promote adipogenesis in TSHR* or gsp* populations. Furthermore, differentiation induced by adipogenic medium with pioglitazone was reduced in TSHR* and abolished in gsp* expressing 3T3L1 cells. TSHR* and gsp* did not inactivate PPARgamma (PPARG as listed in the HUGO database) by phosphorylation but expression of PPARgamma1 was reduced and PPARgamma2 undetectable in gsp*. FOXO1 phosphorylation (required to inactivate this repressor of adipogenesis) was lowest in gsp* despite the activation of AKT by phosphorylation. PROF is a mediator that facilitates FOXO1 phosphorylation by phospho-Akt. Its transcript levels remained constantly low in the gsp* population. In most measurements, the TSHR* cells were between the gsp* and control 3T3L1 preadipocytes. The enhanced down-regulation of PREF1 (adipogenesis inhibitor) permits retention of some adipogenic potential in the TSHR* population. We conclude that Gsalpha signalling impedes FOXO1 phosphorylation and thus inhibits PPARgamma transcription and the alternative promoter usage required to generate PPARgamma2, the fat-specific transcription factor necessary for adipogenesis.
0 "My lung disease won't go away, it's there to stay": profiles of adaptation to functional limitations in workers with asthma and COPD. Earlier research has shown that adaptation (i.e., the way in which employees cope with limitations resulting from their disease) is associated with sick leave. Our aim was to investigate signs of adequate or inadequate adaptation in employees with asthma and COPD. A Q-methodological study was carried out among 34 workers with asthma or COPD. Four adaptation profiles were distinguished: the eager, the adjusted, the cautious, and the worried workers. The adaptation profiles provide insight into the different ways in which workers with asthma and COPD cope with their illness at work. The adaptation profiles serve as a starting point for the design of appropriate (occupational) care. The eager workers experience little difficulties at work; the cautious workers may need assistance in learning how to accept their disease; the worried workers need reassurance, and may need reactivation; the adjusted workers deserve extra attention, and, when necessary, advice on how to live with their asthma or COPD.
3 Association of socioeconomic status with overall overweight and central obesity in men and women: the French Nutrition and Health Survey 2006. Identification of subpopulations at high risk of overweight and obesity is crucial for prevention and management of obesity in different socioeconomic status (SES) categories. The objective of the study was to describe disparities in the prevalence of overweight and obesity across socioeconomic status (SES) groups in 18-74 year-old French adults. Analyses were based on a multistage stratified random sample of non-institutionalized adults aged 18-74-years-old from the French Nutrition and Health Survey (ENNS), a cross-sectional national survey carried out in 2006/2007. Collected data included measured anthropometry (weight, height and waist circumference (WC)), demographic and SES data (occupation, education and frequency of holiday trips as a marker of family income). SES factors associated with overweight (BMI > or = 25) and central obesity (WC above gender-specific references) were identified using multiple logistic regression. Almost half (49.3%) of French adults were overweight or obese and 16.9% were obese. In men, the risk of overall overweight or obesity was associated with occupation (p < 0.05), whereas the risk of central obesity was independently associated with occupation (p < 0.05) and frequency of holiday trips (p < 0.01). In women, both overall and central overweight and obesity were independently associated with educational level (respectively p < 10(-3) and p < 10(-3)) and frequency of holiday trips (respectively p < 0.05 and p < 10-3). The prevalence of overweight and obesity was found to be similar to that of several neighbouring western European countries, and lower than the UK and eastern Europe. Risk of being overweight or obese varied across SES groups both in men and women, but associations were different between men and women, indicating differing determinants.
0 Early-expressed chemokines predict kidney immunopathology in experimental disseminated Candida albicans infections. The mouse intravenous challenge model of Candida albicans infection is widely used to determine aspects of host-fungus interaction. We investigated the production of cytokines in the kidneys and spleen of animals up to 48 h after challenge with virulent and attenuated isolates and related these responses to semi-quantitative estimations of histopathological changes in the kidney. Progression of Candida albicans infection of the kidney in response to highly virulent fungal strains was characterized by higher levels of host cellular infiltrate, higher lesion densities and greater quantities of fungal elements at 24 and 48 h, and by higher kidney concentrations of IL-1beta, MCP-1, KC, IL-6, G-CSF, TNF, MIP-2 and MIP-1beta, among the immune effectors measured. Levels of the chemokine KC as early as 12 h after challenge correlated significantly with all later measurements of lesion severity. Early renal IL-6 and MIP-1beta concentrations also correlated with subsequent damage levels, but less significantly than for KC. All chemokines tested appeared in kidney homogenates, while most of the cytokines were undetectable in kidney and spleen homogenates. GM-CSF and IL-10 showed inverse correlations with measures of lesion severity, suggesting these alone may have exerted a defensive role. Spleen levels of KC at all times showed significant associations with kidney lesion measurements. Elevated chemokine levels, including KC, represent the earliest responses to C. albicans infection in the mouse kidney. Fungal strains of low mouse virulence stimulate a lower innate response and less host infiltrate than more virulent strains. These findings are consistent with immunopathological damage to kidneys in the mouse C. albicans infection model and with growing evidence implicating some TLR pathways as the main point of interaction between fungal surface polysaccharides and leukocytes.
3 Identification of valid reference genes during the differentiation of human myoblasts. Analysis of RNA expression using real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) traditionally includes reference genes (RG) as an internal control. This practice is being questioned as it becomes increasingly clear that RG may vary considerably under certain experimental conditions. Thus, the validity of a particular RG must be determined for each experimental setting. We used qRT-PCR to measure the levels of six RG, which have been reported in the literature to be invariant. The RG were analyzed in human myoblast cultures under differentiation conditions. We examined the expression by qRT-PCR of mRNA encoding Beta-actin (ACTB), Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), TATA box binding protein (TBP) and ribosomal protein, large, P0 (RPLPO). The mRNA expression of the following genes of interest (GOI) were analyzed: skeletal muscle alpha 1 actin (ACTA1), myogenin/myogenic factor 4 (MYOG), embryonic skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain 3 (MYH3) and the activity of creatine phosphokinase (CK). The geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper software programs were used to ascertain the most suitable RG to normalize the RNA input. Using the geNorm program, RPLPO and TBP were found to be the most stable genes, additionally a suitable normalization factor (NF) was calculated. The NormFinder software showed that RPLPO was the most stable, whereas TBP ranked second. BestKeeper program also revealed that RPLPO and TBP as stable genes, but PPIA was the most stable reference gene, whereas GAPDH and ACTB were the worst ranked. RNA expression analyses including three independent softwares revealed that RPLPO, TBP as reference genes or NF calculated by geNorm software, are suitable to normalize the mRNA expression in myoblast after culture under differentiation conditions. Significant correlations can be identified between the differentiations markers ACTA1, MYOG, MYH3 and creatine phosphokinase (CK) activity, when the expression is normalized with the NF calculated with RPLPO and TBP.
3 Synaptotagmin IV: a multifunctional regulator of peptidergic nerve terminals. Many members of the synaptotagmin (Syt) protein family bind Ca(2+) and trigger exocytosis, but some Syt proteins appear to have no Ca(2+)-dependent actions and their biological functions remain obscure. Syt IV is an activity-induced brain protein with no known Ca(2+)-dependent interactions and its subcellular localization and biological functions have sparked considerable controversy. We found Syt IV on both micro- and dense-core vesicles in posterior pituitary nerve terminals in mice. In terminals from Syt IV knockout mice compared with those from wild types, low Ca(2+) entry triggered more exocytosis, high Ca(2+) entry triggered less exocytosis and endocytosis was accelerated. In Syt IV knockouts, dense-core and microvesicle fusion was enhanced in cell-attached patches and dense-core vesicle fusion pores had conductances that were half as large as those in wild types. Given the neuroendocrine functions of the posterior pituitary, changes in Syt IV levels could be involved in endocrine transitions involving alterations in the release of the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin.
3 Clinical characteristics of the autumn-winter type scrub typhus cases in south of Shandong province, northern China. Before 1986, scrub typhus was only found endemic in southern China. Because human infections typically occur in the summer, it is called "summer type". During the autumn-winter period of 1986, a new type of scrub typhus was identified in Shandong and northern Jiangsu province of northern China. This newly recognized scrub typhus was subsequently reported in many areas of northern China and was then called "autumn-winter type". However, clinical characteristics of associated cases have not been reported. From 1995 to 2006, all suspected scrub typhus cases in five township hospitals of Feixian county, Shandong province were enrolled. Indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) was used as confirmatory serodiagnosis test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) connected with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analyses were used for genotyping of O. tsutsugamushi DNAs. Clinical symptoms and demography of confirmed cases were analyzed. A total of 480 scrub typhus cases were confirmed. The cases occurred every year exclusively between September and December with a peak occurrence in October. The case numbers were relatively higher in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 2000 than in other years. 57.9% of cases were in the group aged 21-50. More cases occurred in male (56%) than in female (44%). The predominant occupational group of the cases was farmers (85.0%). Farm work was reported the primary exposure to infection in 67.7% of cases. Fever, rash, and eschar were observed in 100.0%, 90.4%, and 88.5% of cases, respectively. Eschars formed frequently on or around umbilicus, abdomen areas, and front and back of waist (34.1%) in both genders. Normal results were observed in 88.7% (WBC counts), 84.5% (PLT counts), and 89.7% (RBC counts) of cases, respectively. Observations from the five hospitals were compared and no significant differences were found. The autumn-winter type scrub typhus in northern China occurred exclusively from September to December with a peak occurrence in October, which was different from the summer type in southern China. In comparison with the summer type, complications associated with autumn-winter type scrub typhus were less severe, and abnormalities of routine hematological parameters were less obvious.
1 Membrane bound monomer of Staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin induces caspase activation and apoptotic cell death despite initiation of membrane repair pathway. Wild type Staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin (alpha-HL) assembly on target mammalian cells usually results in necrotic form of cell death; however, caspase activation also occurs. The pathways of caspase activation due to binding/partial assembly by alpha-HL are unknown till date. Cells treated with H35N (a mutant of alpha-HL that remains as membrane bound monomer), have been shown to accumulate hypodiploid nuclei, activate caspases and induce intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We have earlier shown that the binding and assembly of alpha-HL requires functional form of Caveolin-1 which is an integral part of caveolae. In this report, we show that the caveolae of mammalian cells, which undergo a continuous cycle of 'kiss and run' dynamics with the plasma membrane, have become immobile upon the binding of the monomer. The cells treated with H35N were unable to recover despite activation of membrane repair mechanism involving caspase-1 dependent activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1. This is for the first time we show the range of cellular changes and responses that take place immediately after the binding of the monomeric form of staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin.
1 A genome-wide association study of hypertension and blood pressure in African Americans. The evidence for the existence of genetic susceptibility variants for the common form of hypertension ("essential hypertension") remains weak and inconsistent. We sought genetic variants underlying blood pressure (BP) by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) among African Americans, a population group in the United States that is disproportionately affected by hypertension and associated complications, including stroke and kidney diseases. Using a dense panel of over 800,000 SNPs in a discovery sample of 1,017 African Americans from the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region, we identified multiple SNPs reaching genome-wide significance for systolic BP in or near the genes: PMS1, SLC24A4, YWHA7, IPO7, and CACANA1H. Two of these genes, SLC24A4 (a sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger) and CACNA1H (a voltage-dependent calcium channel), are potential candidate genes for BP regulation and the latter is a drug target for a class of calcium channel blockers. No variant reached genome wide significance for association with diastolic BP (top scoring SNP rs1867226, p = 5.8 x 10(-7)) or with hypertension as a binary trait (top scoring SNP rs9791170, p = 5.1 x 10(-7)). We replicated some of the significant SNPs in a sample of West Africans. Pathway analysis revealed that genes harboring top-scoring variants cluster in pathways and networks of biologic relevance to hypertension and BP regulation. This is the first GWAS for hypertension and BP in an African American population. The findings suggests that, in addition to or in lieu of relying solely on replicated variants of moderate-to-large effect reaching genome-wide significance, pathway and network approaches may be useful in identifying and prioritizing candidate genes/loci for further experiments.
1 The representation of abstract task rules in the human prefrontal cortex. We have previously reported sustained activation in the ventral prefrontal cortex while participants prepared to perform 1 of 2 tasks as instructed. But there are studies that have reported activation reflecting task rules elsewhere in prefrontal cortex, and this is true in particular when it was left to the participants to decide which rule to obey. The aim of the present experiment was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to find whether there was activation in common, irrespective of the way that the task rules were established. On each trial, we presented a word after a variable delay, and participants had to decide either whether the word was abstract or concrete or whether it had 2 syllables. The participants either decided before the delay which task they would perform or were instructed by written cues. Comparing the self-generated with the instructed trials, there was early task set activation during the delay in the middle frontal gyrus. On the other hand, a conjunction analysis revealed sustained activation in the ventral prefrontal and polar cortex for both conditions. We argue that the ventral prefrontal cortex is specialized for handling conditional rules regardless of how the task rules were established.
1 The Schizosaccharomyces pombe checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Cds1 are important for cell survival in response to cisplatin. DNA damage checkpoints insure that the integrity of genomic DNA is faithfully maintained throughout the eukaryotic cell cycle. In the presence of damaged DNA, checkpoints are triggered to delay cell cycle progression to allow for DNA repair. In fission yeast, the kinases Chk1 and Cds1 are major components of these DNA damage checkpoint pathways. Both Chk1 and Cds1 are important for viability in the presence of several DNA damaging agents. In this study we hypothesized that Chk1 and Cds1 play a vital role in fission yeast cells ability to survive exposure to the DNA damaging agent cisplatin. Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapeutic drug that interacts with DNA and causes both inter- and intra-strand DNA cross-links. Here, we demonstrated that treatment with cisplatin in fission yeast causes a Chk1-dependent DNA damage signal. chk1(-) cells were sensitive to cisplatin and Chk1 was phosphorylated in response to cisplatin treatment. We also showed that a Chk1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint pathway is activated in a dose-dependent fashion in cells challenged with cisplatin. Furthermore the Cds1 checkpoint kinase was also important for viability in cisplatin challenged cells. In cds1(-) cells, cisplatin treatment reduced cell viability and this phenotype was exacerbated in a chk1(-)/cds1(-) background. Thus, we conclude that the concerted effort of both major checkpoint kinases in fission yeast, Chk1 and Cds1, protect cells from cisplatin induced DNA damage. These observations are significant because they suggest that various classes of inter-strand crosslinking agents may generate slightly different lesions as work by others did not observe loss of viability in cds1(-) cells treated with other crosslinking agents like nitrogen mustard.
2 Immediate and early discharge for patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: is there a role in "real life"? An exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most common respiratory condition necessitating admission to hospital. Many of these are relatively mild in nature and as a consequence, there is increasing interest in immediate and early discharge of patients with nonsevere exacerbations. Following initial assessment, "hospital at home" or "assisted discharge" schemes enable suitable patients with COPD to be discharged into the community earlier than normally anticipated. The putative implication is that substantial financial savings can be made in addition to increasing the availability of in-patient beds, without compromising patient care or satisfaction. We highlight the current literature which has evaluated the role of hospital at home and assisted discharge schemes and discuss our own "real life" service operating in a large teaching hospital in Scotland.
0 Sex-associated effect of CETP and LPL polymorphisms on postprandial lipids in familial hypercholesterolaemia. This study assessed the gender-specific influence of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (TaqIB, I405V) and lipoprotein lipase (S447X) polymorphisms on the response to an oral fat tolerance test in heterozygotes for familial hypercholesterolaemia. We selected and genotyped 80 men and postmenopausal women heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolaemia (main group) as well as 11 healthy control subjects. Patients were subgrouped based on their response to oral fat tolerance test. The oral fat tolerance test was defined as pathological when postprandial triglyceride concentration was higher than the highest triglyceride concentration observed in healthy subjects (220 mg/dl) at any time (2, 4, 6 or 8 h). In the pathological subgroup, men had significantly higher incremental area under the curve after oral fat tolerance test than postmenopausal women. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed a gender association of TaqIB and I405V influence on postprandial lipaemia in this subgroup. In conclusion, it seems that gender and TaqIB polymorphism of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene were both associated with the distribution of triglyceride values after oral fat tolerance test, only in subjects with a pathological response to oral fat tolerance test. Specifically, men carrying the B2 allele of the TaqIB polymorphism showed a higher postprandial triglyceride peak and a delayed return to basal values compared with women carrying B2. However, further investigations in larger populations are required to replicate and confirm these findings.
2 Ethnobotanical survey of trees in Fundong, Northwest Region, Cameroon. Ethnobotanical investigations were conducted in Fundong Central Subdivision in the Northwest Region of Cameroon to identify trees growing in the area and collect information on their uses by the local people. This research covered a period of 12 months from May 2007 to April 2008. Ethnobotanical information was collected through the show-and-tell/semi-structured method and personal interviews during field trips. Three villages were investigated. A total of 82 tree species were identified belonging to 70 genera and 42 families. Among these species, 40 were widely used by the local people in traditional medicine to treat 48 human ailments. Tree species were also used for fuel wood, construction materials, wood carving and honey production. Leaves and barks were commonly used in traditional medicine while the wood, branches and the entire plants were commonly used for other purposes. In spite of the scarcity of natural forests in the study area, the local populations continue to depend on indigenous and exotic trees in their surroundings for their survival. There is therefore need for cultivation, protection and sustainable management of these valuable resources for rural livelihoods.
0 State-of-the-art review of goat TSE in the European Union, with special emphasis on PRNP genetics and epidemiology. Scrapie is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats. It is also the earliest known member in the family of diseases classified as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or prion diseases, which includes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and chronic wasting disease in cervids. The recent revelation of naturally occurring BSE in a goat has brought the issue of TSE in goats to the attention of the public. In contrast to scrapie, BSE presents a proven risk to humans. The risk of goat BSE, however, is difficult to evaluate, as our knowledge of TSE in goats is limited. Natural caprine scrapie has been discovered throughout Europe, with reported cases generally being greatest in countries with the highest goat populations. As with sheep scrapie, susceptibility and incubation period duration of goat scrapie are most likely controlled by the prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP). Like the PRNP of sheep, the caprine PRNP shows significantly greater variability than that of cattle and humans. Although PRNP variability in goats differs from that observed in sheep, the two species share several identical alleles. Moreover, while the ARR allele associated with enhancing resistance in sheep is not present in the goat PRNP, there is evidence for the existence of other PrP variants related to resistance. This review presents the current knowledge of the epidemiology of caprine scrapie within the major European goat populations, and compiles the current data on genetic variability of PRNP.
0 Seq4SNPs: new software for retrieval of multiple, accurately annotated DNA sequences, ready formatted for SNP assay design. In moderate-throughput SNP genotyping there was a gap in the workflow, between choosing a set of SNPs and submitting their sequences to proprietary assay design software, which was not met by existing software. Retrieval and formatting of sequences flanking each SNP, prior to assay design, becomes rate-limiting for more than about ten SNPs, especially if annotated for repetitive regions and adjacent variations. We routinely process up to 50 SNPs at once. We created Seq4SNPs, a web-based, walk-away software that can process one to several hundred SNPs given rs numbers as input. It outputs a file of fully annotated sequences formatted for one of three proprietary design softwares: TaqMan's Primer-By-Design FileBuilder, Sequenom's iPLEX or SNPstream's Autoprimer, as well as unannotated fasta sequences. We found genotyping assays to be inhibited by repetitive sequences or the presence of additional variations flanking the SNP under test, and in multiplexes, repetitive sequence flanking one SNP adversely affects multiple assays. Assay design software programs avoid such regions if the input sequences are appropriately annotated, so we used Seq4SNPs to provide suitably annotated input sequences, and improved our genotyping success rate. Adjacent SNPs can also be avoided, by annotating sequences used as input for primer design. The accuracy of annotation by Seq4SNPs is significantly better than manual annotation (P < 1e-5).Using Seq4SNPs to incorporate all annotation for additional SNPs and repetitive elements into sequences, for genotyping assay designer software, minimizes assay failure at the design stage, reducing the cost of genotyping. Seq4SNPs provides a rapid route for replacement of poor test SNP sequences. We routinely use this software for assay sequence preparation. Seq4SNPs is available as a service at (http://moya.srl.cam.ac.uk/oncology/bio/s4shome.html) and (http://moya.srl.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/oncology/srl/ncbi/seq4snp1.pl), currently for human SNPs, but easily extended to include any species in dbSNP.
0 Genetic diversity in Spanish donkey breeds using microsatellite DNA markers. Genetic diversity at 13 equine microsatellite loci was compared in five endangered Spanish donkey breeds: Andaluza, Catalana, Mallorquina, Encartaciones and Zamorano-Leonesa. All of the equine microsatellites used in this study were amplified and were polymorphic in the domestic donkey breeds with the exception of HMS1, which was monomorphic, and ASB2, which failed to amplify. Allele number, frequency distributions and mean heterozygosities were very similar among the Spanish donkey breeds. The unbiased expected heterozygosity (H(E)) over all the populations varied between 0.637 and 0.684 in this study. The low G(ST) value showed that only 3.6% of the diversity was between breeds (P<0.01). Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were shown for a number of locus-population combinations, except HMS5 that showed agreement in all analysed populations. The cumulative exclusion probability (PE) was 0.999 in each breed, suggesting that the loci would be suitable for donkey parentage testing. The constructed dendrogram from the D(A) distance matrix showed little differentiation between Spanish breeds, but great differentiation between them and the Moroccan ass and also with the horse, used as an outgroup. These results confirm the potential use of equine microsatellite loci as a tool for genetic studies in domestic donkey populations, which could also be useful for conservation plans.
3 Apoptotic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of COPD. COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, characterized by a chronic abnormal inflammatory response to noxious agents. Apoptosis is a physiologic process, critical to cellular homeostasis, in which cell death follows a programmed sequence of events. Apoptosis has been recognized to play an important role in clinical and experimental models of lung diseases. Abnormal apoptotic events in smokers' and in emphysematous lungs have been shown in epithelial and endotheliallung cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and myocytes. Many factors associated with COPD, including cigarette smoke, have the potential to cause apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, the main sites of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. The decreased expression of VEGF, a known survival factor for endothelial cells, and its receptor, results in lung septal endothelial cell death, leading perhaps to the emphysema observed in COPD. In smokers who develop COPD there is an activation of adaptive immunity, with an infiltration of CD4+ and, especially, CD8 + cells. CD8 + cells are cytotoxic to epithelial cells through the release of granzymes and perforin, which can further induce apoptosis of alveolar cells. Moreover, any reduction in neutrophil apoptosis or dysregulation of macrophage uptake of apoptotic neutrophils could lead to chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Increased rates of T-cell apoptosis may lead to a defective immune response to infective organisms, contributing to the high frequency of infections seen in COPD. Increased apoptosis of skeletal muscle could be responsible for the skeletal muscle atrophy, the main cause of unexplained weight loss in patients with COPD. This paper is a review of the current knowledge on the apoptotic pathways involved in COPD pathogenesis and their interaction with other known contributing factors.
3 Association of common polymorphisms in known susceptibility genes with rheumatoid arthritis in a Slovak population using osteoarthritis patients as controls. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a common and complex autoimmune disease. As well as the major susceptibility gene HLA-DRB1, recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies reported additional evidence for association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA. This study was initiated to investigate the association between defined genetic markers and RA in a Slovak population. In contrast to recent studies, we included intensively-characterized osteoarthritis (OA) patients as controls. We used material of 520 RA and 303 OA samples in a case-control setting. Six SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan assays. HLA-DRB1 alleles were determined by employing site-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. No statistically significant association of TRAF1/C5 SNPs rs3761847 and rs10818488 with RA was detected. However, we were able to replicate the association signals between RA and HLA-DRB1 alleles, STAT4 (rs7574865), PTPN22 (rs2476601) and OLIG3/TNFAIP3 (rs10499194 and rs6920220). The strongest signal was detected for HLA-DRB1*04 with an allelic P = 1.2*10-13 (OR = 2.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.18 - 3.91). Additionally, SNPs rs7574865STAT4 (P = 9.2*10-6; OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.35 - 2.18) and rs2476601PTPN22 (P = 9.5*10-4; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.23 - 2.26) were associated with susceptibility to RA, whereas after permutation testing OLIG3/TNFAIP3 SNPs rs10499194 and rs6920220 missed our criteria for significance (Pcorr = 0.114 and Pcorr = 0.180, respectively). In our Slovak population, HLA-DRB1 alleles as well as SNPs in STAT4 and PTPN22 genes showed a strong association with RA.
0 Multiple horizontal gene transfer events and domain fusions have created novel regulatory and metabolic networks in the oomycete genome. Complex enzymes with multiple catalytic activities are hypothesized to have evolved from more primitive precursors. Global analysis of the Phytophthora sojae genome using conservative criteria for evaluation of complex proteins identified 273 novel multifunctional proteins that were also conserved in P. ramorum. Each of these proteins contains combinations of protein motifs that are not present in bacterial, plant, animal, or fungal genomes. A subset of these proteins were also identified in the two diatom genomes, but the majority of these proteins have formed after the split between diatoms and oomycetes. Documentation of multiple cases of domain fusions that are common to both oomycetes and diatom genomes lends additional support for the hypothesis that oomycetes and diatoms are monophyletic. Bifunctional proteins that catalyze two steps in a metabolic pathway can be used to infer the interaction of orthologous proteins that exist as separate entities in other genomes. We postulated that the novel multifunctional proteins of oomycetes could function as potential Rosetta Stones to identify interacting proteins of conserved metabolic and regulatory networks in other eukaryotic genomes. However ortholog analysis of each domain within our set of 273 multifunctional proteins against 39 sequenced bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, identified only 18 candidate Rosetta Stone proteins. Thus the majority of multifunctional proteins are not Rosetta Stones, but they may nonetheless be useful in identifying novel metabolic and regulatory networks in oomycetes. Phylogenetic analysis of all the enzymes in three pathways with one or more novel multifunctional proteins was conducted to determine the probable origins of individual enzymes. These analyses revealed multiple examples of horizontal transfer from both bacterial genomes and the photosynthetic endosymbiont in the ancestral genome of Stramenopiles. The complexity of the phylogenetic origins of these metabolic pathways and the paucity of Rosetta Stones relative to the total number of multifunctional proteins suggests that the proteome of oomycetes has few features in common with other Kingdoms.
3 The depletion of nuclear glutathione impairs cell proliferation in 3t3 fibroblasts. Glutathione is considered essential for survival in mammalian cells and yeast but not in prokaryotic cells. The presence of a nuclear pool of glutathione has been demonstrated but its role in cellular proliferation and differentiation is still a matter of debate. We have studied proliferation of 3T3 fibroblasts for a period of 5 days. Cells were treated with two well known depleting agents, diethyl maleate (DEM) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), and the cellular and nuclear glutathione levels were assessed by analytical and confocal microscopic techniques, respectively. Both agents decreased total cellular glutathione although depletion by BSO was more sustained. However, the nuclear glutathione pool resisted depletion by BSO but not with DEM. Interestingly, cell proliferation was impaired by DEM, but not by BSO. Treating the cells simultaneously with DEM and with glutathione ethyl ester to restore intracellular GSH levels completely prevented the effects of DEM on cell proliferation. Our results demonstrate the importance of nuclear glutathione in the control of cell proliferation in 3T3 fibroblasts and suggest that a reduced nuclear environment is necessary for cells to progress in the cell cycle.
3 Gyroid cuticular structures in butterfly wing scales: biological photonic crystals. We present a systematic study of the cuticular structure in the butterfly wing scales of some papilionids (Parides sesostris and Teinopalpus imperialis) and lycaenids (Callophrys rubi, Cyanophrys remus, Mitoura gryneus and Callophrys dumetorum). Using published scanning and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, analytical modelling and computer-generated TEM micrographs, we find that the three-dimensional cuticular structures can be modelled by gyroid structures with various filling fractions and lattice parameters. We give a brief discussion of the formation of cubic gyroid membranes from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the scale's cell, which dry and harden to leave the cuticular structure behind when the cell dies. The scales of C. rubi are a potentially attractive biotemplate for producing three-dimensional optical photonic crystals since for these scales the cuticle-filling fraction is nearly optimal for obtaining the largest photonic band gap in a gyroid structure.
2 Carotid artery resection and reconstruction with superficial femoral artery transplantation: a case report. Managing advanced head and neck cancer is often a difficult task, particularly when massive invasion of the carotid artery is present. However, en bloc resection can be a curative procedure, and reconstruction of the carotid artery limits the risk for stroke. The aim of this study was to describe the interest, indication, potential risks, and methods by which we carried out resections as well as reconstructions of the carotid artery using superficial femoral artery transplantation. We presented one case of en bloc resection of the carotid artery with reconstruction with superficial femoral artery transplantation. Postoperative care was uneventful. The patient did not suffer from neurological deficiency. After three years of follow-up, the patient survived without any cancer recurrence. The occurrence of massive cancer invasion into the carotid artery should not be a contraindication for surgery. En bloc resection of the carotid artery with revascularization using the superficial femoral artery allows for appropriate control of the cancer, and carries an acceptable level of neurological risk.
2 Gene delivery to the rat liver using cationic lipid emulsion/DNA complex: comparison between intra-arterial, intraportal and intravenous administration. To compare the efficiency of intra-arterial, intraportal, and intravenous administration of cationic lipid emulsion/DNA complex, as used for gene transfer to rat liver. DNA-carrier complex for the in-vivo experiment was prepared by mixing DNA and a cationic lipid emulsion. According to the administration route used (intra-arterial, intraportal, or intravenous), the animals were assigned to one of three groups. The heart, lung, liver, spleen and kidneys were removed and assayed for total protein and luciferase concentration. The cationic lipid emulsion/DNA complex used successfully transfected the various organs via the different administration routes employed. Luciferase activity in each organ of untreated animals was negligible. Liver luciferase values were significantly higher in the groups in which intra-arterial or intraportal administration was used. The intra-arterial or intraportal administration of cationic lipid emulsion/DNA complex is superior to intravenous administration and allows selective gene transfer to the liver.
1 Efficacy of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate by GOLD stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: analysis from the randomised, placebo-controlled TORCH study. The efficacy of inhaled salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate (SFC) in patients with severe or very severe COPD is well documented. However, there are only limited data about the influence of GOLD severity staging on the effectiveness of SFC, particularly in patients with milder disease. TORCH was a 3-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 6112 patients with moderate/severe COPD with pre-bronchodilator FEV1 < 60% predicted (mean age 65 years, 76% male, mean 44% predicted FEV1, 43% current smokers). To understand the relative efficacy of SFC and its components by GOLD stages, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of the TORCH dataset using baseline post-bronchodilator FEV1 to segment patients into three groups: moderate COPD (GOLD stage II and above: >or= 50%; n = 2156), severe COPD (GOLD stage III: 30% to < 50%; n = 3019) and very severe COPD (GOLD stage IV: < 30%; n = 937). Compared with placebo, SFC improved post-bronchodilator FEV1: 101 ml (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71, 132) in GOLD stage II, 82 ml (95% CI: 60, 104) in GOLD stage III and 96 ml (95% CI: 54, 138) in GOLD stage IV patients, and reduced the rate of exacerbations: 31% (95% CI: 19, 40) in GOLD stage II, 26% (95% CI: 17, 34) in GOLD stage III and 14% (95% CI: -4, 29) in GOLD stage IV. SFC improved health status to a greater extent than other treatments regardless of baseline GOLD stage. Similarly, SFC reduced the risk of death by 33% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.98) for GOLD stage II, 5% (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.24) for GOLD stage III, and 30% (HR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.05) for GOLD stage IV. The rates of adverse events were similar across treatment arms and increased with disease severity. Overall, there was a higher incidence of pneumonia in the fluticasone propionate and SFC arms, compared with other treatments in all GOLD stages. In the TORCH study, SFC reduced moderate-to-severe exacerbations and improved health status and FEV1 across GOLD stages. Treatment with SFC may be associated with reduced mortality compared with placebo in patients with GOLD stage II disease. The effects were similar to those reported for the study as a whole. Thus, SFC is an effective treatment option for patients with GOLD stage II COPD. Clinicaltrial.gov registration NCT00268216; Study number: SCO30003.
1 Significant differences in the use of healthcare resources of native-born and foreign born in Spain. In the last decade, the number of foreign residents in Spain has doubled and it has become one of the countries in the European Union with the highest number of immigrants There is no doubt that the health of the immigrant population has become a relevant subject from the point of view of public healthcare. Our study aimed at describing the potential inequalities in the use of healthcare resources and in the lifestyles of the resident immigrant population of Spain. Cross-sectional, epidemiological study from the Spanish National Health Survey (NHS) in 2006, from the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs. We have worked with individualized secondary data, collected in the Spanish National Health Survey carried out in 2006 and 2007 (SNHS-06), from the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs. The format of the SNHS-06 has been adapted to the requirements of the European project for the carrying out of health surveys. The economic immigrant population resident in Spain, present diseases that are similar to those of the indigenous population. The immigrant population shows significantly lower values in the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and physical activity (OR = 0.76; CI 95%: 0.65-0.89, they nonetheless perceive their health condition as worse than that reported by the autochthonous population (OR = 1.63, CI 95%: 1.34-1.97). The probability of the immigrant population using emergency services in the last 12 months was significantly greater than that of the autochthonous population (OR = 1.31, CI 95%: 1.12-1.54). This situation repeats itself when analyzing hospitalization data, with values of probability of being hospitalized greater among immigrants (OR = 1.39, CI 95%: 1.07-1.81). The economic immigrants have better parameters in relation to lifestyles, but they have a poor perception of their health. Despite the fact that immigrant population shows higher percentages of emergency attendance and hospitalization than the indigenous population, with respect to the use of healthcare resources, their usage of healthcare resources such as drugs, influenza vaccinations or visits to the dentist is lower.
1 Transcriptome analysis of the venom gland of the scorpion Scorpiops jendeki: implication for the evolution of the scorpion venom arsenal. The family Euscorpiidae, which covers Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, is one of the most widely distributed scorpion groups. However, no studies have been conducted on the venom of a Euscorpiidae species yet. In this work, we performed a transcriptomic approach for characterizing the venom components from a Euscorpiidae scorpion, Scorpiops jendeki. There are ten known types of venom peptides and proteins obtained from Scorpiops jendeki. Great diversity is observed in primary sequences of most highly expressed types. The most highly expressed types are cytolytic peptides and serine proteases. Neurotoxins specific for sodium channels, which are major groups of venom components from Buthidae scorpions, are not detected in this study. In addition to those known types of venom peptides and proteins, we also obtain nine atypical types of venom molecules which haven't been observed in any other scorpion species studied to date. This work provides the first set of cDNAs from Scorpiops jendeki, and one of the few transcriptomic analyses from a scorpion. This allows the characterization of a large number of venom molecules, belonging to either known or atypical types of scorpion venom peptides and proteins. Besides, our work could provide some clues to the evolution of the scorpion venom arsenal by comparison with venom data from other scorpion lineages.
3 Evidence for a role of NTS2 receptors in the modulation of tonic pain sensitivity. Central neurotensin (NT) administration results in a naloxone-insensitive antinociceptive response in animal models of acute and persistent pain. Both NTS1 and NTS2 receptors were shown to be required for different aspects of NT-induced analgesia. We recently demonstrated that NTS2 receptors were extensively associated with ascending nociceptive pathways, both at the level of the dorsal root ganglia and of the spinal dorsal horn. Then, we found that spinally administered NTS2-selective agonists induced dose-dependent antinociceptive responses in the acute tail-flick test. In the present study, we therefore investigated whether activation of spinal NTS2 receptors suppressed the persistent inflammatory pain symptoms observed after intraplantar injection of formalin. We first demonstrated that spinally administered NT and NT69L agonists, which bind to both NTS1 and NTS2 receptors, significantly reduced pain-evoked responses during the inflammatory phase of the formalin test. Accordingly, pretreatment with the NTS2-selective analogs JMV-431 and levocabastine was effective in inhibiting the aversive behaviors induced by formalin. With resolution at the single-cell level, we also found that activation of spinal NTS2 receptors reduced formalin-induced c-fos expression in dorsal horn neurons. However, our results also suggest that NTS2-selective agonists and NTS1/NTS2 mixed compounds differently modulated the early (21-39 min) and late (40-60 min) tonic phase 2 and recruited endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms integrated at different levels of the central nervous system. Indeed, while non-selective drugs suppressed pain-related behaviors activity in both part of phase 2, intrathecal injection of NTS2-selective agonists was only efficient in reducing pain during the late phase 2. Furthermore, assessment of the stereotypic pain behaviors of lifting, shaking, licking and biting to formalin also revealed that unlike non-discriminative NTS1/NTS2 analogs reversing all nociceptive endpoint behaviors, pure NTS2 agonists specifically inhibited paw lifting, supporting a role of NTS2 in spinal modulation of persistent nociception. The present study provides the first demonstration that activation of NTS2 receptors produces analgesia in the persistent inflammatory pain model of formalin. The dichotomy between these two classes of compounds also indicates that both NTS1 and NTS2 receptors are involved in tonic pain inhibition and implies that these two NT receptors modulate the pain-induced behavioral responses by acting on distinct spinal and/or supraspinal neural circuits. In conclusion, development of NT agonists targeting both NTS1 and NTS2 receptors could be useful for chronic pain management.
1 Relating neuronal firing patterns to functional differentiation of cerebral cortex. It has been empirically established that the cerebral cortical areas defined by Brodmann one hundred years ago solely on the basis of cellular organization are closely correlated to their function, such as sensation, association, and motion. Cytoarchitectonically distinct cortical areas have different densities and types of neurons. Thus, signaling patterns may also vary among cytoarchitectonically unique cortical areas. To examine how neuronal signaling patterns are related to innate cortical functions, we detected intrinsic features of cortical firing by devising a metric that efficiently isolates non-Poisson irregular characteristics, independent of spike rate fluctuations that are caused extrinsically by ever-changing behavioral conditions. Using the new metric, we analyzed spike trains from over 1,000 neurons in 15 cortical areas sampled by eight independent neurophysiological laboratories. Analysis of firing-pattern dissimilarities across cortical areas revealed a gradient of firing regularity that corresponded closely to the functional category of the cortical area; neuronal spiking patterns are regular in motor areas, random in the visual areas, and bursty in the prefrontal area. Thus, signaling patterns may play an important role in function-specific cerebral cortical computation.
3 Chemicals possessing a neurotrophin-like activity on dopaminergic neurons in primary culture. Neurotrophic factors have been shown to possess strong neuroprotective and neurorestaurative properties in Parkinson's disease patients. However the issues to control their delivery into the interest areas of the brain and their surgical administration linked to their unability to cross the blood brain barrier are many drawbacks responsible of undesirable side effects limiting their clinical use. A strategy implying the use of neurotrophic small molecules could provide an interesting alternative avoiding neurotrophin administration and side effects. In an attempt to develop drugs mimicking neurotrophic factors, we have designed and synthesized low molecular weight molecules that exhibit neuroprotective and neuritogenic potential for dopaminergic neurons. A cell-based screening of an in-house quinoline-derived compound collection led to the characterization of compounds exhibiting both activities in the nanomolar range on mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in spontaneous or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-induced neurodegeneration. This study provides evidence that rescued neurons possess a functional dopamine transporter and underlines the involvement of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathway in these processes. Cell-based screening led to the discovery of a potent neurotrophic compound possessing expected physico-chemical properties for blood brain barrier penetration as a serious candidate for therapeutic use in Parkinson disease.
1 Presence of necrotic strains of Potato virus Y in Mexican potatoes. As part of a routine screening for the possible presence of the necrotic strains of potato virus Y affecting potatoes in Mexico, five PVY isolates were submitted to biological and molecular analysis. Considering their serological properties, two belong to the common strain (O) and three to the necrotic strain (N). All the isolates induced vein necrosis in Nicotiana tabacum. To characterize the isolates, 5' NTR and P1 genes were sequenced and compared with sequences from GenBank database. Nucleotide sequence similarity ranged from 47-100% in the 5' NTR and from 63-100% in the P1 coding region. The lowest amino acid similarity between sequences of P1 gene was 55%. In phylogenetic trees of 5'NTR analysis, two PVY(O) Mexican isolates clustered with other PVY(O) isolates. In turn, the three PVY(N) isolates grouped with PVY(N-NTN) isolates. The phylogenetic analysis of P1 sequences (nucleotide and amino acid) showed two PVY(O) isolates grouping next to N-NTN cluster. A detailed analysis of the PVY(O) isolates showed two potential recombination regions in the P1 gene, in contrast to 5'NTR where no recombination was detected.
2 Translation, adaptation and validation of the American short form Patient Activation Measure (PAM13) in a Danish version. The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a measure that assesses patient knowledge, skill, and confidence for self-management. This study validates the Danish translation of the 13-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM13) in a Danish population with dysglycaemia. 358 people with screen-detected dysglycaemia participating in a primary care health education study responded to PAM13. The PAM13 was translated into Danish by a standardised forward-backward translation. Data quality was assessed by mean, median, item response, missing values, floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha and average inter-item correlation) and item-rest correlations. Scale properties were assessed by Rasch Rating Scale models. The item response was high with a small number of missing values (0.8-4.2%). Floor effect was small (range 0.6-3.6%), but the ceiling effect was above 15% for all items (range 18.6-62.7%). The alpha-coefficient was 0.89 and the average inter-item correlation 0.38. The Danish version formed a unidimensional, probabilistic Guttman-like scale explaining 43.2% of the variance. We did however, find a different item sequence compared to the original scale. A Danish version of PAM13 with acceptable validity and reliability is now available. Further development should focus on single items, response categories in relation to ceiling effects and further validation of reproducibility and responsiveness.
0 Response of tibialis anterior tendon to a chronic exposure of stretch-shortening cycles: age effects. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of aging on tendon response to repetitive exposures of stretch-shortening cycles (SSC's). The left hind limb from young (3 mo, N = 4) and old (30 mo, N = 9) male Fisher 344 x Brown Norway rats were exposed to 80 maximal SSCs (60 deg/s, 50 deg range of motion) 3 x/week for 4.5 weeks in vivo. After the last exposure, tendons from the tibialis anterior muscle were isolated, stored at -80 degrees C, and then tested using a micro-mechanical testing machine. Deformation of each tendon was evaluated using both relative grip-to-grip displacements and reference marks via a video system. At failure, the young control tendons had higher strain magnitude than the young exposed (p < 0.01) and the old control tendons (p < .0001). Total load at inflection was affected by age only (p < 0.01). Old exposed and control tendons exhibited significantly higher loads at the inflection point than their young counterparts (p < 0.05 for both comparisons). At failure, the old exposed tendons carried higher loads than the young exposed tendons (p < 0.05). Stiffness was affected by age only at failure where the old tendons exhibited higher stiffness in both exposed and control tendons than their young counterparts (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). The chronic protocol enhanced the elastic stiffness of young tendon and the loads in both the young and old tendons. The old exposed tendons were found to exhibit higher load capacity than their younger counterparts, which differed from our initial hypothesis.
3 Prevalence of problem alcohol use among patients attending primary care for methadone treatment. Problem alcohol use is associated with adverse health outcomes among current or former heroin users and primary care is providing methadone treatment for increasing numbers of this population. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of problem alcohol use among current or former heroin users attending primary care for methadone treatment and to describe the socio-demographic characteristics and health service utilisation characteristics associated with problem alcohol uses. We conducted a cross sectional survey of patients sampled from a national database of patients attending general practice for methadone treatment. Participants were recruited by their general practitioner and data was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire, which included the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ('AUDIT'), with a score of >7 considered abnormal (ie 'AUDIT positive cases') and socio-demographic, medical and substance use characteristics. We interviewed 196 patients (71% of those invited, 31% of those sampled, 11% of the national database). The median age was 32 years, 55% were hepatitis C positive, 79% had used illicit drugs in the previous month and 68% were male. Sixty-eight 'AUDIT positive' cases were identified (prevalence of 35%, 95% CI = 28-41%) and these were more likely to have attended a local Emergency Department in the previous year (p < 0.05) and less likely to have attended a hospital clinic in the previous year (p < 0.05). Twenty-seven (14%) scored 20 or higher indicating possible alcohol dependence. Problem alcohol use has a high prevalence among current or former heroin users attending primary care for methadone treatment and interventions that address this issue should be explored as a priority. Interventions that address problem alcohol use in this population should be considered as a priority, although the complex medical and psychological needs of this population may make this challenging.
1 Modest effect of p53, EGFR and HER-2/neu on prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer: a meta-analysis. P53, EGFR and HER-2/neu are the most frequently studied molecular biological parameters in epithelial ovarian cancer, but their prognostic impact is still unequivocal. We performed a meta-analysis to more precisely estimate their prognostic significance. Published studies that investigated the association between p53, EGFR and HER-2/neu status and survival were identified. Meta-analysis was performed using a DerSimonian-Laird model. Publication bias was investigated using funnel plots and sources of heterogeneity were identified using meta-regression analysis. A total of 62 studies were included for p53, 15 for EGFR and 20 for HER-2/neu. P53, EGFR and HER-2/neu status had a modest effect on overall survival (pooled HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.33-1.61 for p53; HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.25-2.19 for EGFR and HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.34-2.08 for HER-2/neu). Meta-regression analysis for p53 showed that FIGO stage distribution influenced study outcome. For EGFR and HER-2/neu, considerable publication bias was present. Although p53, EGFR and HER-2/neu status modestly influences survival, these markers are, by themselves, unlikely to be useful as prognostic markers in clinical practice. Our study highlights the need for well-defined, prospective clinical trials and more complete reporting of results of prognostic factor studies.
3 Five-year change in visceral adipose tissue quantity in a minority cohort: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) family study. OBJECTIVE To describe the 5-year change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Absolute change in VAT and SAT measured by abdominal computed tomography scans has been obtained at a 5-year interval from African Americans (n = 389) and Hispanic Americans (n = 844), aged 20-69 years, in 10-year age-groups. RESULTS Mean 5-year increases in VAT areas in women were 18, 7, 4, 0.4, and -3 cm(2) for African Americans and 13, 7, 3, 1, and -15 cm(2) for Hispanics, across the 5 age decades (trend not significant). Mean 5-year increases in SAT areas in women were 88, 46, 19, 17, and 14 cm(2) for African Americans and 53, 20, 17, 12, and 1 cm(2) for Hispanics, across the 5 age decades (P < 0.05 for both). Similar trends have been observed in men. CONCLUSIONS Accumulation of abdominal fat is greatest in young adulthood. These data may be useful in identifying subgroups at risk of type 2 diabetes.
0 Lack of cross-scale linkages reduces robustness of community-based fisheries management. Community-based management and the establishment of marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as means to overcome overexploitation of fisheries. Yet, researchers and managers are divided regarding the effectiveness of these measures. The "tragedy of the commons" model is often accepted as a universal paradigm, which assumes that unless managed by the State or privatized, common-pool resources are inevitably overexploited due to conflicts between the self-interest of individuals and the goals of a group as a whole. Under this paradigm, the emergence and maintenance of effective community-based efforts that include cooperative risky decisions as the establishment of marine reserves could not occur. In this paper, we question these assumptions and show that outcomes of commons dilemmas can be complex and scale-dependent. We studied the evolution and effectiveness of a community-based management effort to establish, monitor, and enforce a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Our findings build on social and ecological research before (1997-2001), during (2002) and after (2003-2004) the establishment of marine reserves, which included participant observation in >100 fishing trips and meetings, interviews, as well as fishery dependent and independent monitoring. We found that locally crafted and enforced harvesting rules led to a rapid increase in resource abundance. Nevertheless, news about this increase spread quickly at a regional scale, resulting in poaching from outsiders and a subsequent rapid cascading effect on fishing resources and locally-designed rule compliance. We show that cooperation for management of common-pool fisheries, in which marine reserves form a core component of the system, can emerge, evolve rapidly, and be effective at a local scale even in recently organized fisheries. Stakeholder participation in monitoring, where there is a rapid feedback of the systems response, can play a key role in reinforcing cooperation. However, without cross-scale linkages with higher levels of governance, increase of local fishery stocks may attract outsiders who, if not restricted, will overharvest and threaten local governance. Fishers and fishing communities require incentives to maintain their management efforts. Rewarding local effective management with formal cross-scale governance recognition and support can generate these incentives.
3 Can the relationship between doctors and drug companies ever be a healthy one? The financial ties between doctors and drug companies have come under intense scrutiny in recent years. Some commentators--such as Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine--argue that the mission of doctors is fundamentally different to the mission of drug companies and that the ties between them should be completely cut. "Drug companies are investor owned businesses with a responsibility to maximise profits for their shareholders," says Angell. "That is quite different from the mission of the medical profession, which is to provide the best care possible for patients." Other commentators have argued that clinicians and drug companies do have some shared goals in aiming to maximize human health. In this debate, Emma D'Arcy, co-founder of a social networking site that facilitates interactions between doctors and drug companies, argues that it would be valuable to the public if we could establish "authentic alliances" between these professionals. But journalist Ray Moynihan argues that such alliances are prone to the corrupting influence of pharmaceutical industry money, and that disentanglement is a healthier alternative.
0 A structural model for K2P potassium channels based on 23 pairs of interacting sites and continuum electrostatics. K(2P)Ø, the two-pore domain potassium background channel that determines cardiac rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster, and its homologues that establish excitable membrane activity in mammals are of unknown structure. K(2P) subunits have two pore domains flanked by transmembrane (TM) spans: TM1-P1-TM2-TM3-P2-TM4. To establish spatial relationships in K(2P)Ø, we identified pairs of sites that display electrostatic compensation. Channels silenced by the addition of a charge in pore loop 1 (P1) or P2 were restored to function by countercharges at specific second sites. A three-dimensional homology model was determined using the crystal structure of K(V)1.2, effects of K(2P)Ø mutations to establish alignment, and compensatory charge-charge pairs. The model was refined and validated by continuum electrostatic free energy calculations and covalent linkage of introduced cysteines. K(2P) channels use two subunits arranged so that the P1 and P2 loops contribute to one pore, identical P loops face each other diagonally across the pore, and the channel complex has bilateral symmetry with a fourfold symmetric selectivity filter.
1 Apoptosis gene profiling reveals spatio-temporal regulated expression of the p53/Mdm2 pathway during lens development. Evidence is emerging for apoptosis gene expression in the lens during development. Therefore, here we used a filter array to assess expression of 243 apoptosis-related genes in the developing postnatal mouse lens using (33)P labelled cDNA synthesized from p7 and p14 mouse lenses. We demonstrated that 161 apoptosis-related genes were expressed at levels significantly above background and 20 genes were potentially significantly differentially expressed (P<0.05) by at least 2-fold between p7 and p14. We used RT-PCR to confirm expression of these genes in newborn, p7, p14 and 4 wk mouse lens cDNA samples. Expression of 19/20 of the genes examined was confirmed, while 5 genes (Huntingtin, Mdm2, Dffa, galectin-3 and Mcl-1) were confirmed as differentially regulated between p7 and p14. RT-PCR was also used to examine the expression of the chick homologues of the most-highly expressed and/or potentially differentially regulated genes in chick embryo lenses at E6-E16. The majority of genes expressed in the postnatal mouse lens were also expressed in the chick embryo lens. Western blotting confirmed developmentally regulated expression of Axl and Mcl-1 during mouse lens development and of Mdm2, Mdm4/X and p53 during mouse and chick lens development. Western blotting also revealed the presence of p53 and Mdm4/X splice variants and/or proteolytic cleavage products in the developing lens. Since Mdm2 is a regulator of the tumour suppressor gene p53, we chose to thoroughly investigate the spatio-temporal expression patterns of p53, Mdm2 and the functionally related Mdm4/X in mouse lens development at E12.5-E16.5 using immunocytochemistry. We also examined Mdm2 expression patterns during chick lens development at E6-E16 and Mdm4/X and p53 at E14. Expression of Mdm2, Mdm4/X and p53 was spatio-temporally regulated in various compartments of the developing lens in both mouse and chick, including lens epithelial and lens fibre cells, indicating potential roles for these factors in regulation of lens epithelial cell proliferation and/or lens fibre cell differentiation This study provides a thorough initial analysis of apoptosis gene expression in the postnatal mouse lens and provides a resource for further investigation of the roles in lens development of the apoptosis genes identified. Furthermore, building on the array studies, we present the first spatio-temporal analysis of expression of p53 pathway molecules (p53, Mdm2 and Mdm4/X) in both developing mouse and chick lenses, suggesting a potential role for the p53/Mdm2 pathway in lens development, which merits further functional analysis.
3 New Mid-Cretaceous (latest Albian) dinosaurs fromWinton, Queensland, Australia. Australia's dinosaurian fossil record is exceptionally poor compared to that of other similar-sized continents. Most taxa are known from fragmentary isolated remains with uncertain taxonomic and phylogenetic placement. A better understanding of the Australian dinosaurian record is crucial to understanding the global palaeobiogeography of dinosaurian groups, including groups previously considered to have had Gondwanan origins, such as the titanosaurs and carcharodontosaurids. We describe three new dinosaurs from the late Early Cretaceous (latest Albian) Winton Formation of eastern Australia, including; Wintonotitan wattsi gen. et sp. nov., a basal titanosauriform; Diamantinasaurus matildae gen. et sp. nov., a derived lithostrotian titanosaur; and Australovenator wintonensis gen. et sp. nov., an allosauroid. We compare an isolated astragalus from the Early Cretaceous of southern Australia; formerly identified as Allosaurus sp., and conclude that it most-likely represents Australovenator sp. The occurrence of Australovenator from the Aptian to latest Albian confirms the presence in Australia of allosauroids basal to the Carcharodontosauridae. These new taxa, along with the fragmentary remains of other taxa, indicate a diverse Early Cretaceous sauropod and theropod fauna in Australia, including plesiomorphic forms (e.g. Wintonotitan and Australovenator) and more derived forms (e.g. Diamantinasaurus).
1 WebGMAP: a web service for mapping and aligning cDNA sequences to genomes. The genomes of thousands of organisms are being sequenced, often with accompanying sequences of cDNAs or ESTs. One of the great challenges in bioinformatics is to make these genomic sequences and genome annotations accessible in a user-friendly manner to general biologists to address interesting biological questions. We have created an open-access web service called WebGMAP (http://www.bioinfolab.org/software/webgmap) that seamlessly integrates cDNA-genome alignment tools, such as GMAP, with easy-to-use data visualization and mining tools. This web service is intended to facilitate community efforts in improving genome annotation, determining accurate gene structures and their variations, and exploring important biological processes such as alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation. For routine sequence analysis, WebGMAP provides a web-based sequence viewer with many useful functions, including nucleotide positioning, six-frame translations, sequence reverse complementation, and imperfect motif detection and alignment. WebGMAP also provides users with the ability to sort, filter and search for individual cDNA sequences and cDNA-genome alignments. Our EST-Genome-Browser can display annotated gene structures and cDNA-genome alignments at scales from 100 to 50 000 nt. With its ability to highlight base differences between query cDNAs and the genome, our EST-Genome-Browser allows biologists to discover potential point or insertion-deletion variations from cDNA-genome alignments.
3 Expression, purification and bioactivities analysis of recombinant active peptide from shark liver. The Active Peptide from Shark Liver (APSL) was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells. The cDNA encoding APSL protein was obtained from shark regenerated hepatic tissue by RT-PCR, then it was cloned in the pET-28a expression vector. The expressed fusion protein was purified by Ni-IDA affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE and HPLC analysis showed the purity of the purified fusion protein was more than 98%. The recombinant APSL (rAPSL) was tested for its biological activity both in vitro, by its ability to improve the proliferation of SMMC7721 cells, and in vivo, by its significant protective effects against acute hepatic injury induced by CCl(4) and AAP (acetaminophen) in mice. In addition, the rAPSL could decrease the blood glucose concentration of mice with diabetes mellitus induced by alloxan. Paraffin sections of mouse pancreas tissues showed that rAPSL (3 mg/kg) could effectively protect mouse islets from lesions induced by alloxan, which indicated its potential application in theoretical research and industry.
1 Amplification and overexpression of Hsa-miR-30b, Hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 at 8q24.22-q24.23 in medulloblastoma. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour of childhood. The identification of critical genes involved in its pathogenesis will be central to advances in our understanding of its molecular basis, and the development of improved therapeutic approaches. We performed a SNP-array based genome-wide copy number analysis in medulloblastoma cell lines, to identify regions of genomic amplification and homozygous deletion, which may harbour critical disease genes. A series of novel and established medulloblastoma defects were detected (MYC amplification (n = 4), 17q21.31 high-level gain (n = 1); 9p21.1-p21.3 (n = 1) and 6q23.1 (n = 1) homozygous deletion). Most notably, a novel recurrent region of genomic amplification at 8q24.22-q24.23 was identified (n = 2), and selected for further investigation. Additional analysis by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (iFISH), PCR-based mapping and SNP-array revealed this novel amplification at 8q24.22-q24.23 is independent of MYC amplification at 8q24.21, and is unique to medulloblastoma in over 800 cancer cell lines assessed from different tumour types, suggesting it contains key genes specifically involved in medulloblastoma development. Detailed mapping identified a 3Mb common minimal region of amplification harbouring 3 coding genes (ZFAT1, LOC286094, KHDRBS3) and two genes encoding micro-RNAs (hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d). Of these, only expression of hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 correlated with copy number status, and all three of these transcripts also displayed evidence of elevated expression in sub-sets of primary medulloblastomas, measured relative to the normal cerebellum. These data implicate hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 as putative oncogenic target(s) of a novel recurrent medulloblastoma amplicon at 8q24.22-q24.23. Our findings suggest critical roles for these genes in medulloblastoma development, and further support the contribution of micro-RNA species to medulloblastoma pathogenesis.
0 Sonographic evaluation of breast nodules: comparison of conventional, real-time compound, and pulse-inversion harmonic images. To compare the use of conventional, real-time compound, and pulse-inversion harmonic imaging in the evaluation of breast nodules. Fifty-two breast nodules were included in this study, conducted between May and December 2000, in which conventional, real-time compound, and pulse-inversion harmonic images were obtained in the same plane. Three radiologists, each blinded to the interpretations of the other two, evaluated the findings, characterizing the lesions and ranking the three techniques from grade 1, the worst, to grade 3, the best. Lesion conspicuity was assessed, and lesions were also characterized in terms of their margin, clarity of internal echotexture, and clarity of posterior echo pattern. The three techniques were compared using Friedman's test, and interobserver agreement in image interpretation was assessed by means of the intraclass correlation coefficient. With regard to lesion conspicuity, margin, and internal echotexture of the nodules, real-time compound imaging was the best technique (p < 0.05); in terms of posterior echo pattern, the best was pulse-inversion harmonic imaging (p < 0.05). Real-time compound and pulse inversion harmonic imaging were better than conventional sonography in all evaluative aspects. Interobserver agreement was greater than moderate. Real-time compound and pulse-inversion harmonic imaging procedures are superior to conventional sonography in terms of both lesion conspicuity and the further characterization of breast nodules. Real-time compound imaging is the best technique for evaluation of the margin and internal echotexture of nodules, while pulse-inversion harmonic imaging is very effective for the evaluation of the posterior echo patterns.
3 Activation of calpain-1 in human carotid artery atherosclerotic lesions. In a previous study, we observed that oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced death of endothelial cells was calpain-1-dependent. The purpose of the present paper was to study the possible activation of calpain in human carotid plaques, and to compare calpain activity in the plaques from symptomatic patients with those obtained from patients without symptoms. Human atherosclerotic carotid plaques (n = 29, 12 associated with symptoms) were removed by endarterectomy. Calpain activity and apoptosis were detected by performing immunohistochemical analysis and TUNEL assay on human carotid plaque sections. An antibody specific for calpain-proteolyzed alpha-fodrin was used on western blots. We found that calpain was activated in all the plaques and calpain activity colocalized with apoptotic cell death. Our observation of autoproteolytic cleavage of the 80 kDa subunit of calpain-1 provided further evidence for enzyme activity in the plaque samples. When calpain activity was quantified, we found that plaques from symptomatic patients displayed significantly lower calpain activity compared with asymptomatic plaques. These novel results suggest that calpain-1 is commonly active in carotid artery atherosclerotic plaques, and that calpain activity is colocalized with cell death and inversely associated with symptoms.
1 A model of postural control in quiet standing: robust compensation of delay-induced instability using intermittent activation of feedback control. The main purpose of this study is to compare two different feedback controllers for the stabilization of quiet standing in humans, taking into account that the intrinsic ankle stiffness is insufficient and that there is a large delay inducing instability in the feedback loop: 1) a standard linear, continuous-time PD controller and 2) an intermittent PD controller characterized by a switching function defined in the phase plane, with or without a dead zone around the nominal equilibrium state. The stability analysis of the first controller is carried out by using the standard tools of linear control systems, whereas the analysis of the intermittent controllers is based on the use of Poincaré maps defined in the phase plane. When the PD-control is off, the dynamics of the system is characterized by a saddle-like equilibrium, with a stable and an unstable manifold. The switching function of the intermittent controller is implemented in such a way that PD-control is 'off' when the state vector is near the stable manifold of the saddle and is 'on' otherwise. A theoretical analysis and a related simulation study show that the intermittent control model is much more robust than the standard model because the size of the region in the parameter space of the feedback control gains (P vs. D) that characterizes stable behavior is much larger in the latter case than in the former one. Moreover, the intermittent controller can use feedback parameters that are much smaller than the standard model. Typical sway patterns generated by the intermittent controller are the result of an alternation between slow motion along the stable manifold of the saddle, when the PD-control is off, and spiral motion away from the upright equilibrium determined by the activation of the PD-control with low feedback gains. Remarkably, overall dynamic stability can be achieved by combining in a smart way two unstable regimes: a saddle and an unstable spiral. The intermittent controller exploits the stabilizing effect of one part of the saddle, letting the system evolve by alone when it slides on or near the stable manifold; when the state vector enters the strongly unstable part of the saddle it switches on a mild feedback which is not supposed to impose a strict stable regime but rather to mitigate the impending fall. The presence of a dead zone in the intermittent controller does not alter the stability properties but improves the similarity with biological sway patterns. The two types of controllers are also compared in the frequency domain by considering the power spectral density (PSD) of the sway sequences generated by the models with additive noise. Different from the standard continuous model, whose PSD function is similar to an over-damped second order system without a resonance, the intermittent control model is capable to exhibit the two power law scaling regimes that are typical of physiological sway movements in humans.
1 Diabetes does not affect outcome in patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia. There is limited information about the effect of diabetes on the prognosis of patients with bacterial infections. We performed a retrospective cohort study to investigate possible correlations between diabetes and prognosis in patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia. We reviewed the medical charts of 1112 patients who were treated at a community teaching hospital for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia from January 1997 through June 2007. Factors associated with in-hospital mortality were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Among the 1112 patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia, 181 (16.3%) were diabetic patients; 90 patients (8.1%) died while in the hospital. Compared to non-diabetic patients, diabetic patients were older (75.4 +/- 11.9 years vs. 70 +/- 16.6 years, p < 0.001) and had more comorbidities. However, mortality among diabetic and non-diabetic patients was not different [7.2% vs. 8.2%, RR 1.13; 95% CI (0.67-1.9); p = 0.39]. In a multivariate analysis, the variables associated with in-hospital mortality were age, the origin of the bacteremia, and the presence of immunosuppression. Diabetes was not associated with outcome. In this cohort of patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia, diabetes was not associated with a poorer prognosis.
1 Validation study of a distress screener. A 3-item screening instrument called the Distress Screener was developed for early identification of distress among employees on sick leave. The Distress Screener consists of three items obtained from the distress subscale of the four-dimensional symptom questionnaire (4DSQ). This study assessed an optimal cut-off point and validated the Distress Screener by relating it to the 4DSQ and to medical diagnoses. 171 sick-listed employees filled in the Distress Screener and the 4DSQ (containing four subscales: distress, depression, anxiety and somatisation) and medical diagnoses were obtained from occupational physicians (OPs). The optimal cut-off point was assessed by computing sensitivity and specificity values. Validity was assessed by relating the Distress Screener score to the scores on 4DSQ subscales. In addition scores were compared to mental health medical diagnoses and the degree of similarity between two repeated measurements was obtained. Using the 4DSQ distress score >10 as reference standard, the optimal cut-off point of the Distress Screener was > or =4. Regarding validity, a high correlation (0.82) existed between the Distress Screener and the 4DSQ distress subscale and it was significantly different from the correlations with the other 4DSQ subscales. Also a high correlation existed for the test-retest reliability (0.83). Furthermore, a high score on the Distress Screener seemed to be related to the medical diagnosis 'Stress-related complaints'. All low scores seemed to be related to the medical diagnosis 'Other complaints'. Sensitivity (0.85) and specificity (0.78) values, and positive and negative predictive values of the screener were comparable to those of the 4DSQ distress subscale. The Distress Screener is a valid instrument for use by the OP during consulting time as a quick scan for early identification of distress in employees on sick leave. The cut-off point > or =4 is useful for early identification of distress in employees on sick leave.
1 Effectiveness of national cervical cancer screening programme in Taiwan: 12-year experiences. We examined cervical cancer incidence before and after nationwide cervical cancer screening was initiated in Taiwan in mid-1995. The invasive cancer incidence decreased by 47.8% during 1995-2006. The carcinoma in situ incidence increased 1.7-fold during 1995-2000, and decreased by 19.6% during 2000-2006. The Taiwan national programme has significantly decreased invasive cervical cancer.
0 Definition, conservation and epigenetics of housekeeping and tissue-enriched genes. Housekeeping genes (HKG) are constitutively expressed in all tissues while tissue-enriched genes (TEG) are expressed at a much higher level in a single tissue type than in others. HKGs serve as valuable experimental controls in gene and protein expression experiments, while TEGs tend to represent distinct physiological processes and are frequently candidates for biomarkers or drug targets. The genomic features of these two groups of genes expressed in opposing patterns may shed light on the mechanisms by which cells maintain basic and tissue-specific functions. Here, we generate gene expression profiles of 42 normal human tissues on custom high-density microarrays to systematically identify 1,522 HKGs and 975 TEGs and compile a small subset of 20 housekeeping genes which are highly expressed in all tissues with lower variance than many commonly used HKGs. Cross-species comparison shows that both the functions and expression patterns of HKGs are conserved. TEGs are enriched with respect to both segmental duplication and copy number variation, while no such enrichment is observed for HKGs, suggesting the high expression of HKGs are not due to high copy numbers. Analysis of genomic and epigenetic features of HKGs and TEGs reveals that the high expression of HKGs across different tissues is associated with decreased nucleosome occupancy at the transcription start site as indicated by enhanced DNase hypersensitivity. Additionally, we systematically and quantitatively demonstrated that the CpG islands' enrichment in HKGs transcription start sites (TSS) and their depletion in TEGs TSS. Histone methylation patterns differ significantly between HKGs and TEGs, suggesting that methylation contributes to the differential expression patterns as well. We have compiled a set of high quality HKGs that should provide higher and more consistent expression when used as references in laboratory experiments than currently used HKGs. The comparison of genomic features between HKGs and TEGs shows that HKGs are more conserved than TEGs in terms of functions, expression pattern and polymorphisms. In addition, our results identify chromatin structure and epigenetic features of HKGs and TEGs that are likely to play an important role in regulating their strikingly different expression patterns.
3 ATP-dependent ligases in trypanothione biosynthesis--kinetics of catalysis and inhibition by phosphinic acid pseudopeptides. Glutathionylspermidine is an intermediate formed in the biosynthesis of trypanothione, an essential metabolite in defence against chemical and oxidative stress in the Kinetoplastida. The kinetic mechanism for glutathionylspermidine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.8) from Crithidia fasciculata (CfGspS) obeys a rapid equilibrium random ter-ter model with kinetic constants K(GSH) = 609 microM, K(Spd) = 157 microM and K(ATP) = 215 microM. Phosphonate and phosphinate analogues of glutathionylspermidine, previously shown to be potent inhibitors of GspS from Escherichia coli, are equally potent against CfGspS. The tetrahedral phosphonate acts as a simple ground state analogue of glutathione (GSH) (K(i) approximately 156 microM), whereas the phosphinate behaves as a stable mimic of the postulated unstable tetrahedral intermediate. Kinetic studies showed that the phosphinate behaves as a slow-binding bisubstrate inhibitor [competitive with respect to GSH and spermidine (Spd)] with rate constants k(3) (on rate) = 6.98 x 10(4) M(-1) x s(-1) and k(4) (off rate) = 1.3 x 10(-3) s(-1), providing a dissociation constant K(i) = 18.6 nM. The phosphinate analogue also inhibited recombinant trypanothione synthetase (EC 6.3.1.9) from C. fasciculata, Leishmania major, Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei with K(i)(app) values 20-40-fold greater than that of CfGspS. This phosphinate analogue remains the most potent enzyme inhibitor identified to date, and represents a good starting point for drug discovery for trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis.
0 Deoxycholate induces COX-2 expression via Erk1/2-, p38-MAPK and AP-1-dependent mechanisms in esophageal cancer cells. The progression from Barrett's metaplasia to adenocarcinoma is associated with the acquirement of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. The bile acid deoxycholate (DCA) has been proposed to play an important role in the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, but the precise molecular mechanisms remain undefined. The aim of this study was to investigate DCA-stimulated COX-2 signaling pathways and their possible contribution to deregulated cell survival and apoptosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. Following exposure of SKGT-4 cells to DCA, protein levels of COX-2, MAPK and PARP were examined by immunoblotting. AP-1 activity was assessed by mobility shift assay. DCA-induced toxicity was assessed by DNA fragmentation and MTT assay. DCA induced persistent activation of the AP-1 transcription factor with Fra-1 and JunB identified as the predominant components of the DCA-induced AP-1 complex. DCA activated Fra-1 via the Erk1/2- and p38 MAPK while Erk1/2 is upstream of JunB. Moreover, DCA stimulation mediated inhibition of proliferation with concomitant low levels of caspase-3-dependent PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. Induction of the anti-apoptotic protein COX-2 by DCA, via MAPK/AP-1 pathway appeared to balance the DCA mediated activation of pro-apoptotic markers such as PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. Both of these markers were increased upon COX-2 suppression by aspirin pretreatment prior to DCA exposure. DCA regulates both apoptosis and COX-2-regulated cell survival in esophageal cells suggesting that the balance between these two opposing signals may determine the transformation potential of DCA as a component of the refluxate.
0 A common genetic variant in the 15q24 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene cluster (CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4) is associated with a reduced ability of women to quit smoking in pregnancy. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women are more likely to quit smoking during pregnancy than at any other time in their lives, but some pregnant women continue to smoke. A recent genome-wide association study demonstrated an association between a common polymorphism (rs1051730) in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene cluster (CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4) and both smoking quantity and nicotine dependence. We aimed to test whether the same polymorphism that predisposes to greater cigarette consumption would also reduce the likelihood of smoking cessation in pregnancy. We studied 7845 pregnant women of European descent from the South-West of England. Using 2474 women who smoked regularly immediately pre-pregnancy, we analysed the association between the rs1051730 risk allele and both smoking cessation during pregnancy and smoking quantity. Each additional copy of the risk allele was associated with a 1.27-fold higher odds (95% CI 1.11-1.45) of continued smoking during pregnancy (P = 0.0006). Adjustment for pre-pregnancy smoking quantity weakened, but did not remove this association [odds ratio (OR) 1.20 (95% CI 1.03-1.39); P = 0.018]. The same risk allele was also associated with heavier smoking before pregnancy and in the first, but not the last, trimester [OR for smoking 10+ cigarettes/day versus 1-9/day in first trimester = 1.30 (95% CI 1.13-1.50); P = 0.0003]. To conclude, we have found strong evidence of association between the rs1051730 variant and an increased likelihood of continued smoking in pregnancy and have confirmed the previously observed association with smoking quantity. Our data support the role of genetic factors in influencing smoking cessation during pregnancy.
0 Risk factors for symptom onset in PI*Z alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In an early study of highly symptomatic patients with PI*Z alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT), tobacco smoking was identified as a risk factor by comparing the age of symptom onset in smokers and nonsmokers. Age of symptom onset has not been well studied in relationship to other environmental exposures. Environmental exposures were assessed in 313 PI*Z adults through retrospective self-administered questionnaire. Age of onset of symptoms with and without these exposures were analyzed through survival analysis. Personal smoking was the most important risk factor, associated with earlier onset of cough and wheeze, and showed a dose-dependent relationship with the onset of dyspnea. Childhood environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure was independently associated with younger age of onset of cough. Earlier onset of wheeze was also associated with childhood respiratory infections and family history of emphysema. The report of childhood respiratory infections was associated with childhood ETS exposure, but no statistically significant interactions were noted. We conclude that both personal and secondhand exposure to tobacco smoke in childhood are likely to accelerate the onset of symptoms in AAT deficient patients. Respiratory infections in childhood may also contribute to this risk.
2 Selection responses for the number of fertile eggs of the Brown Tsaiya duck (Anas platyrhynchos) after a single artificial insemination with pooled Muscovy (Cairina moschata) semen. A seven-generation selection experiment comprising a selected (S) and a control (C) line was conducted with the objective of increasing the number of fertile eggs (F) of the Brown Tsaiya duck after a single artificial insemination (AI) with pooled Muscovy semen. Both lines consisted of about 20 males and 60 females since parents in each generation and each female duck was tested 3 times, at 26, 29 and 32 weeks of age. The fertile eggs were measured by candling at day 7 of incubation. The selection criterion in the S line was the BLUP animal model value for F. On average, 24.7% of the females and 15% of the males were selected. The direct responses to the selection for F, and correlated responses for the number of eggs set (Ie), the number of total dead embryos (M), the maximum duration of fertility (Dm) and the number of hatched mule ducklings (H) were measured by studying the differences across the generations of selection between the phenotypic value averages in the S and C lines. The predicted genetic responses were calculated by studying the differences between the S and C lines in averaged values of five traits of the BLUP animal model. The selection responses and the predicted responses showed similar trends. There was no genetic change for Ie. After seven generations of selection, the average selection responses per generation were 0.40, 0.33, 0.42, 0.41 genetic standard deviation units for F, M, Dm, and H respectively. Embryo viability was not impaired by this selection. For days 2-8 after AI, the fertility rates (F/Ie) were 89.2% and 63.8%, the hatchability rates (H/F) were 72.5% and 70.6%, and (H/Ie) were 64.7% and 45.1% in the S and C lines respectively. It was concluded that upward selection on the number of fertile eggs after a single AI with pooled Muscovy semen may be effective in ducks to increase the duration of the fertile period and the fertility and hatchability rates with AI once a week instead of twice a week.
3 Voltage-dependent anion channel 2 of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtVDAC2) is involved in ABA-mediated early seedling development. The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is the major transport protein in the outer membrane of mitochondria and plays crucial roles in energy metabolism, apoptosis, and metabolites transport. In plants, the expression of VDACs can be affected by different stresses, including drought, salinity and pathogen defense. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of AtVDAC2 in A. thaliana and found ABA suppressed the accumulation of AtVDAC2 transcripts. Further, phenotype analysis of this VDAC deregulated-expression transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicated that AtVDAC2 anti-sense line showed an ABA-insensitivity phenotype during the early seedling development under ABA treatment. The results suggested that AtVDAC2 might be involved in ABA signaling in A. thaliana.
3 Automated genome mining for natural products. Discovery of new medicinal agents from natural sources has largely been an adventitious process based on screening of plant and microbial extracts combined with bioassay-guided identification and natural product structure elucidation. Increasingly rapid and more cost-effective genome sequencing technologies coupled with advanced computational power have converged to transform this trend toward a more rational and predictive pursuit. We have developed a rapid method of scanning genome sequences for multiple polyketide, nonribosomal peptide, and mixed combination natural products with output in a text format that can be readily converted to two and three dimensional structures using conventional software. Our open-source and web-based program can assemble various small molecules composed of twenty standard amino acids and twenty two other chain-elongation intermediates used in nonribosomal peptide systems, and four acyl-CoA extender units incorporated into polyketides by reading a hidden Markov model of DNA. This process evaluates and selects the substrate specificities along the assembly line of nonribosomal synthetases and modular polyketide synthases. Using this approach we have predicted the structures of natural products from a diverse range of bacteria based on a limited number of signature sequences. In accelerating direct DNA to metabolomic analysis, this method bridges the interface between chemists and biologists and enables rapid scanning for compounds with potential therapeutic value.
3 PLAN2L: a web tool for integrated text mining and literature-based bioentity relation extraction. There is an increasing interest in using literature mining techniques to complement information extracted from annotation databases or generated by bioinformatics applications. Here we present PLAN2L, a web-based online search system that integrates text mining and information extraction techniques to access systematically information useful for analyzing genetic, cellular and molecular aspects of the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Our system facilitates a more efficient retrieval of information relevant to heterogeneous biological topics, from implications in biological relationships at the level of protein interactions and gene regulation, to sub-cellular locations of gene products and associations to cellular and developmental processes, i.e. cell cycle, flowering, root, leaf and seed development. Beyond single entities, also predefined pairs of entities can be provided as queries for which literature-derived relations together with textual evidences are returned. PLAN2L does not require registration and is freely accessible at http://zope.bioinfo.cnio.es/plan2l.
0 Safety assessment of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in the treatment of adult patients with severe sepsis. Drotrecogin alfa (activated; recombinant activated protein C) was shown to reduce 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis and to have an acceptable safety profile in 1690 patients studied in the F1K-MC-EVAD (PROWESS) trial. We analyzed all available data on the safety of treatment with drotrecogin alfa (activated) in 2786 adult patients with severe sepsis enrolled in all phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, and in an estimated 3991 patients receiving the drug in commercial use. Mortality and safety analyses were performed on all available data from adult severe sepsis patients enrolled in seven clinical trials as of 12 April 2002. Trial-specific safety data and spontaneously reported serious adverse events from commercial use were extracted from a pharmacovigilance database. The 28-day mortality rate for all adult patients who received active treatment in all clinical trials was 25.3% (704/2786). Serious bleeding events during the infusion period and 28-day study period occurred in 2.8% (79/2786) and 5.3% (148/2786) of patients, respectively. Of bleeding events during the infusion period, 43% (34/79) were procedure-related. Fatal serious bleeding events during the infusion period occurred in 0.4% (12/2786) of cases. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) events during the infusion period and 28-day study period occurred in 0.6% (16/2786) and 1.1% (32/2786) of patients, respectively. Ten out of the 16 ICH events occurring during the study drug infusion period were associated with severe thrombocytopenia (<or= 30000/mm3) and/or meningitis. Serious bleeding and ICH events spontaneously reported from commercial use (n = 3991) occurred in 0.9% and 0.2% of patients, respectively. Drotrecogin alfa (activated) significantly reduces mortality in severe sepsis. The efficacy and safety profiles of drotrecogin alfa (activated) have remained consistent over the conduct of multiple clinical trials. The most important serious adverse event associated with drotrecogin alfa (activated) treatment is bleeding. Additional clinical experience indicates that invasive procedures are associated with a substantial percentage of serious bleeding events, particularly those occurring at the start of infusion of the drug. Severe thrombocytopenia (for all serious bleeding events, including ICH) and meningitis (for ICH only) may be risk factors for serious bleeding. However, patients with severe thrombocytopenia and/or meningitis may be at greater risk for bleeding or ICH in the absence of drug therapy.
0 Coordinate regulation of glycan degradation and polysaccharide capsule biosynthesis by a prominent human gut symbiont. Bacteria in the distal human gut have evolved diverse abilities to metabolize complex glycans, including the capacity to degrade these compounds as nutrients and to assemble their component sugars into new polymers such as extracellular capsules. The human gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is well endowed with the ability to metabolize both host- and diet-derived glycans. Its genome contains 88 different polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) for complex glycan catabolism and eight different gene clusters for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis. Here, we investigate one of the prominent mechanisms by which this gut symbiont regulates many PULs involved in host mucin O-glycan degradation; namely, transcriptional regulation via the concerted interactions of cell-envelope-localized TonB-dependent transporters, extra-cytoplasmic function sigma factors and anti-sigma factors, which participate together in a regulatory pathway termed trans-envelope signaling. Unexpectedly, we found that several different trans-envelope signaling switches involved in PUL-mediated O-glycan degradation also modulate capsular polysaccharide synthesis. A novel regulatory pathway, which is dependent on expression of O-glycan-targeting outer membrane proteins, governs this coordinated regulation of glycan catabolism and capsule synthesis. This latter finding provides a new link in the dynamic interplay between complex glycan metabolism, microbial physiology, and host responses that occurs during colonization of the gut.
2 Extent of MGMT promoter methylation correlates with outcome in glioblastomas given temozolomide and radiotherapy. Epigenetic silencing of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) by promoter methylation is associated with improved survival in glioblastomas treated with alkylating agents. In this study, we investigated MGMT promoter methylation in glioblastomas treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy in a single UK treatment centre. Quantitative methylation data at individual CpG sites were obtained by pyrosequencing for 109 glioblastomas. Median overall survival (OS) was 12.4 months with 2-year survival of 17.9%. Pyrosequencing data were reproducible with archival samples yielding data for all glioblastomas. Variation in methylation patterns of discrete CpG sites and intratumoral methylation heterogeneity were observed. A total of 58 out of 109 glioblastomas showed average methylation >non-neoplastic brain in at least one clinical sample; 86% had homogeneous methylation status in multiple samples. Methylation was an independent prognostic factor associated with prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. Cases with methylation more than 35% had the longest survival (median PFS 19.2; OS 26.2 months, 2-year survival of 59.7%). Significant differences in PFS were seen between those with intermediate or high methylation and unmethylated cases, whereas cases with low, intermediate or high methylation all showed significantly different OS. These data indicate that MGMT methylation is prognostically significant in glioblastomas given chemoradiotherapy in the routine clinic; furthermore, the extent of methylation may be used to provide additional prognostic stratification.
0 Seasonal differences in leaf-level physiology give lianas a competitive advantage over trees in a tropical seasonal forest. Lianas are an important component of most tropical forests, where they vary in abundance from high in seasonal forests to low in seasonal forests. We tested the hypothesis that the physiological ability of lianas to fix carbon (and thus grow) during seasonal drought may confer a distinct advantage in seasonal tropical forests, which may explain pan-tropical liana distributions. We compared a range of leaf-level physiological attributes of 18 co-occurring liana and 16 tree species during the wet and dry seasons in a tropical seasonal forest in Xishuangbanna, China. We found that, during the wet season, lianas had significantly higher CO(2) assimilation per unit mass (A(mass)), nitrogen concentration (N(mass)), and delta(13)C values, and lower leaf mass per unit area (LMA) than trees, indicating that lianas have higher assimilation rates per unit leaf mass and higher integrated water-use efficiency (WUE), but lower leaf structural investments. Seasonal variation in CO(2) assimilation per unit area (A(area)), phosphorus concentration per unit mass (P(mass)), and photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE), however, was significantly lower in lianas than in trees. For instance, mean tree A(area) decreased by 30.1% from wet to dry season, compared with only 12.8% for lianas. In contrast, from the wet to dry season mean liana delta(13)C increased four times more than tree delta(13)C, with no reduction in PNUE, whereas trees had a significant reduction in PNUE. Lianas had higher A(mass) than trees throughout the year, regardless of season. Collectively, our findings indicate that lianas fix more carbon and use water and nitrogen more efficiently than trees, particularly during seasonal drought, which may confer a competitive advantage to lianas during the dry season, and thus may explain their high relative abundance in seasonal tropical forests.
0 The HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor modulates lifespan in C. elegans. During normal development or during disease, animal cells experience hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions, and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors implement most of the critical changes in gene expression that enable animals to adapt to this stress. Here, we examine the roles of HIF-1 in post-mitotic aging. We examined the effects of HIF-1 over-expression and of hif-1 loss-of-function mutations on longevity in C. elegans, a powerful genetic system in which adult somatic cells are post-mitotic. We constructed transgenic lines that expressed varying levels of HIF-1 protein and discovered a positive correlation between HIF-1 expression levels and lifespan. The data further showed that HIF-1 acted in parallel to the SKN-1/NRF and DAF-16/FOXO transcription factors to promote longevity. HIF-1 over-expression also conferred increased resistance to heat and oxidative stress. We isolated and characterized additional hif-1 mutations, and we found that each of 3 loss-of-function mutations conferred increased longevity in normal lab culture conditions, but, unlike HIF-1 over-expression, a hif-1 deletion mutation did not extend the lifespan of daf-16 or skn-1 mutants. We conclude that HIF-1 over-expression and hif-1 loss-of-function mutations promote longevity by different pathways. These data establish HIF-1 as one of the key stress-responsive transcription factors that modulate longevity in C. elegans and advance our understanding of the regulatory networks that link oxygen homeostasis and aging.
3 Hepatic P450 enzyme activity, tissue morphology and histology of mink (Mustela vison) exposed to polychlorinated dibenzofurans. Dose- and time-dependent effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQ) of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF), or a mixture of these two congeners on hepatic P450 enzyme activity and tissue morphology, including jaw histology, of adult ranch mink were determined under controlled conditions. Adult female ranch mink were fed either TCDF (0.98, 3.8, or 20 ng TEQ(TCDF)/kg bw/day) or PeCDF (0.62, 2.2, or 9.5 ng TEQ(PeCDF)/kg bw/day), or a mixture of TCDF and PeCDF (4.1 ng TEQ(TCDF)/kg bw/day and 2.8 ng TEQ(PeCDF)/kg bw/day, respectively) for 180 days. Doses used in this study were approximately eight times greater than those reported in a parallel field study. Activities of the cytochrome P450 1A enzymes, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and methoxyresorufin O-deethylase (MROD) were significantly greater in livers of mink exposed to TCDF, PeCDF, and a mixture of the two congeners; however, there were no significant histological or morphological effects observed. It was determined that EROD and MROD activity can be used as sensitive biomarkers of exposure to PeCDF and TCDF in adult female mink; however, under the conditions of this study, the response of EROD/MROD induction occurred at doses that were less than those required to cause histological or morphological changes.
1 Trachoma in Western Equatoria State, Southern Sudan: implications for national control. Trachoma is thought to be common over large parts of Southern Sudan. However, many areas of the country, particularly west of the Nile, have not yet been surveyed. The aim of this study was to confirm whether trachoma extends into Western Equatoria State from neighboring Central Equatoria, where trachoma is highly prevalent, and whether intervention with the SAFE strategy is required. Population-based cross-sectional surveys were conducted using a two-stage cluster random sampling method to select the study population. Subjects were examined for trachoma by experienced graders using the World Health Organization (WHO) simplified grading scheme. Two counties thought to be most likely to have trachoma were surveyed, Maridi and Mundri. In Maridi, prevalence of one of the signs of active trachoma (trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF)) in children aged 1-9 years was 0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0%-0.8%), while no children showing the other possible sign, trachomatous inflammation-intense (TI), were identified. No trachomatous trichiasis (TT) was found in those aged under 15, and prevalence was 0.1% (95% CI, 0.0%-0.4%) in those aged 15 years and above. In Mundri, active trachoma was also limited to signs of TF, with a prevalence of 4.1% (95% CI, 1.4%-6.9%) in children aged 1-9 years. Again, no TT was found in those aged under 15, and prevalence in those aged 15 years and above was 0.3% (95% CI, 0.0%-0.8%). Trachoma prevalence in the east of Western Equatoria State is below the WHO recommended intervention threshold for mass drug administration of antibiotic treatment in all villages. However, the prevalence of TF and TT in some villages, particularly in Mundri County, is sufficiently high to warrant targeted interventions at the community level. These results demonstrate that trachoma is not a major public health problem throughout Southern Sudan. Further studies will be required to determine trachoma prevalence in other areas, particularly west of the Nile, but there are presently no resources to survey each county. Studies should thus be targeted to areas where collection of new data would be most informative.
3 Production of superoxide anions by keratinocytes initiates P. acnes-induced inflammation of the skin. Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the sebaceous follicles. Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), a gram-positive anareobic bacterium, plays a critical role in the development of these inflammatory lesions. This study aimed at determining whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by keratinocytes upon P. acnes infection, dissecting the mechanism of this production, and investigating how this phenomenon integrates in the general inflammatory response induced by P. acnes. In our hands, ROS, and especially superoxide anions (O2(*-)), were rapidly produced by keratinocytes upon stimulation by P. acnes surface proteins. In P. acnes-stimulated keratinocytes, O2(*-) was produced by NAD(P)H oxidase through activation of the scavenger receptor CD36. O2(*-) was dismuted by superoxide dismutase to form hydrogen peroxide which was further detoxified into water by the GSH/GPx system. In addition, P. acnes-induced O2(*-) abrogated P. acnes growth and was involved in keratinocyte lysis through the combination of O2(*-) with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrites. Finally, retinoic acid derivates, the most efficient anti-acneic drugs, prevent O2(*-) production, IL-8 release and keratinocyte apoptosis, suggesting the relevance of this pathway in humans.
0 Immune mediators in patients with acute diabetic foot syndrome. OBJECTIVE Subclinical inflammation is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes and diabetes complications. However, data on the association between inflammation and acute diabetic foot syndrome are scarce. The aim of this study was to compare systemic immune mediators in diabetic patients with and without an ulcer and to identify modulating factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Circulating levels of acute-phase proteins, cytokines, and chemokines were measured in diabetic patients with an ulcer (n = 170) and without an ulcer (n = 140). Of the patients, 88% had type 2 diabetes. RESULTS Patients with an acute foot ulcer had higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, interleukin (IL)-6, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, and interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 as well as lower levels of RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted) (all P < 0.01). No differences were found for IL-8, IL-18, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Most of these associations persisted after adjustment for demographic and anthropometric data, metabolic confounders, and diabetes complications. In multivariate models, size of ulcer according to the University of Texas classification but not the grade of infection was independently associated with three markers of subclinical inflammation (CRP, IL-6, and fibrinogen). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate in our cross-sectional study that acute foot ulcers and their severity are associated with a marked upregulation of acute-phase proteins, cytokines, and chemokines independently of the concomitant infection. Further studies should investigate whether an activation of the immune system precedes the development of foot ulcer and whether anti-inflammatory therapies might be effective.
0 Central metabolism in Mycobacterium smegmatis during the transition from O2-rich to O2-poor conditions as studied by isotopomer-assisted metabolite analysis. Isotopomer-assisted metabolite analysis was used to investigate the central metabolism of Mycobacterium smegmatis and its transition from normal growth to a non-replicating state under a hypoxic environment. Tween 80 significantly promoted aerobic growth by improving O(2) transfer, while only small amount was degraded and metabolized via the TCA cycle for biomass synthesis. As the bacillus encountered hypoxic stress, isotopomer analysis suggested: (1) isocitrate lyase activity increased, which further induced glyoxylate pathway and glycine dehydrogenase for replenishing NAD(+); (2) the relative amount of acetyl-CoA entering the TCA cycle was doubled, whereas little entered the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways.
1 Polyglutamine disruption of the huntingtin exon 1 N terminus triggers a complex aggregation mechanism. Simple polyglutamine (polyQ) peptides aggregate in vitro via a nucleated growth pathway directly yielding amyloid-like aggregates. We show here that the 17-amino-acid flanking sequence (HTT(NT)) N-terminal to the polyQ in the toxic huntingtin exon 1 fragment imparts onto this peptide a complex alternative aggregation mechanism. In isolation, the HTT(NT) peptide is a compact coil that resists aggregation. When polyQ is fused to this sequence, it induces in HTT(NT), in a repeat-length dependent fashion, a more extended conformation that greatly enhances its aggregation into globular oligomers with HTT(NT) cores and exposed polyQ. In a second step, a new, amyloid-like aggregate is formed with a core composed of both HTT(NT) and polyQ. The results indicate unprecedented complexity in how primary sequence controls aggregation within a substantially disordered peptide and have implications for the molecular mechanism of Huntington's disease.
1 The Nicaraguan pediatric dengue cohort study: study design, methods, use of information technology, and extension to other infectious diseases. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is a major public health problem worldwide. In 2004, the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study was established in Managua, Nicaragua, to study the natural history and transmission of dengue in children. Here, the authors describe the study design, methods, and results from 2004 to 2008. Initially, 3,721 children 2-9 years of age were recruited through door-to-door visits. Each year, new children aged 2 years are enrolled in the study to maintain the age structure. Children are provided with medical care through the study, and data from each medical visit are recorded on systematic study forms. All participants presenting with suspected dengue or undifferentiated fever are tested for dengue by virologic, serologic, and molecular biologic assays. Yearly blood samples are collected to detect inapparent dengue virus infections. Numerous information and communications technologies are used to manage study data, track samples, and maintain quality control, including personal data assistants, barcodes, global information systems, and fingerprint scans. Close collaboration with the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health and use of almost entirely local staff are essential components for success. This study is providing critical data on the epidemiology and transmission of dengue in the Americas needed for future vaccine trials.
2 Sustained virological response is associated with clearance of hepatitis C virus RNA and a decrease in hepatitis C virus antibody. Viral eradication in chronic hepatitis C patients with sustained virological response (SVR) after interferon (IFN) therapy remains controversial. During a long-term follow-up study, 157 patients with SVR to IFN-alpha-2b-based therapy were investigated with a transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay in serum. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody was assessed by measuring the optical density (OD) (Axsym HCV v3.0) and the semiquantitative titres (RIBA HCV v3.0) of the HCV antibodies directed against the core, NS3, NS4 and NS5 proteins. A control group included 23 untreated patients with persistently normal serum alanine aminotransferase and detectable serum HCV-RNA. The median duration of follow-up was 4.0 (0-10) years. Serum HCV-RNA remained undetectable in all patients. The mean HCV antibody OD were 93 +/- 19 and 45 +/- 21 before therapy and in the last available serum sample respectively (P=0.001). There was a marked decrease in the HCV antibodies directed against the NS3, NS4 and NS5 proteins (P=0.001), while the core protein titre remained strongly positive. The 23 control patients were followed for a median of 5 (2-14) years. The mean HCV antibody OD were 65 +/- 14 and 64 +/- 19 in the first and the last measurements, respectively (NS), and HCV antibody titres for structural and non-structural proteins remained unchanged. This long-term study evaluating 157 patients demonstrated that SVR assessed by TMA is durable, and HCV antibodies were markedly decreased (mainly those directed against the non-structural proteins), emphasizing an absence of ongoing infection. These results strongly suggest that HCV infection cured in patients who achieve an SVR.
0 Exercise-induced up-regulation of MMP-1 and IL-8 genes in endurance horses. The stress response is a critical factor in the training of equine athletes; it is important for performance and for protection of the animal against physio-pathological disorders.In this study, the molecular mechanisms involved in the response to acute and strenuous exercise were investigated using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect modifications in transcription levels of the genes for matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), which were derived from previous genome-wide expression analysis. Significant up-regulation of these two genes was found in 10 horses that had completed a race of 90-120 km in a time-course experimental design. These results suggest that MMP-1 and IL-8 are both involved in the exercise-induced stress response, and this represents a starting point from which to understand the adaptive responses to this phenomenon.
3 Market failure, policy failure and other distortions in chronic disease markets. The increasing prevalence of chronic disease represents a significant burden on most health systems. This paper explores the market failures and policy failures that exist in the management of chronic diseases. There are many sources of market failure in health care that undermine the efficiency of chronic disease management. These include incomplete information as well as information asymmetry between providers and consumers, the effect of externalities on consumer behaviour, and the divergence between social and private time preference rates. This has seen government and policy interventions to address both market failures and distributional issues resulting from the inability of private markets to reach an efficient and equitable distribution of resources. However, these have introduced a series of policy failures such as distorted re-imbursement arrangements across modalities and delivery settings. The paper concludes that market failure resulting from a preference of individuals for 'immediate gratification' in the form of health care and disease management, rather than preventative services, where the benefits are delayed, has a major impact on achieving an efficient allocation of resources in markets for the management of chronic diseases. This distortion is compounded by government health policy that tends to favour medical and pharmaceutical interventions further contributing to distortions in the allocation of resources and inefficiencies in the management of chronic disease.
2 A randomized controlled trial of tai chi for long-term low back pain (TAI CHI): study rationale, design, and methods. Low back pain persisting for longer than 3 months is a common and costly condition for which many current treatments have low-moderate success rates at best. Exercise is among the more successful treatments for this condition, however, the type and dosage of exercise that elicits the best results is not clearly defined. Tai chi is a gentle form of low intensity exercise that uses controlled movements in combination with relaxation techniques and is currently used as a safe form of exercise for people suffering from other chronic pain conditions such as arthritis. To date, there has been no scientific evaluation of tai chi as an intervention for people with back pain. Thus the aim of this study will be to examine the effects of a tai chi exercise program on pain and disability in people with long-term low back pain. The study will recruit 160 healthy individuals from the community setting to be randomised to either a tai chi intervention group or a wait-list control group. Individuals in the tai chi group will attend 2 tai chi sessions (40 minutes)/week for 8 weeks followed by 1 tai chi session/week for 2 weeks. The wait-list control will continue their usual health care practices and have the opportunity to participate in the tai chi program once they have completed the follow-up assessments. The primary outcome will be bothersomeness of back symptoms measured with a 0-10 numerical rating scale. Secondary outcomes include, self-reports of pain-related disability, health-related quality of life and global perceived effect of treatment. Statistical analysis of primary and secondary outcomes will be based on the intention to treat principle. Linear mixed models will be used to test for the effect of treatment on outcome at 10 weeks follow up. This trial has received ethics approval from The University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee. HREC Approval No.10452 This study will be the first trial in this area and the information on its effectiveness will allow patients, clinicians and treatment funders to make informed choices regarding this treatment. This trial has been registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. ACTRN12608000270314.
0 Identification of candidate regulatory SNPs by combination of transcription-factor-binding site prediction, SNP genotyping and haploChIP. Disease-associated SNPs detected in large-scale association studies are frequently located in non-coding genomic regions, suggesting that they may be involved in transcriptional regulation. Here we describe a new strategy for detecting regulatory SNPs (rSNPs), by combining computational and experimental approaches. Whole genome ChIP-chip data for USF1 was analyzed using a novel motif finding algorithm called BCRANK. 1754 binding sites were identified and 140 candidate rSNPs were found in the predicted sites. For validating their regulatory function, seven SNPs found to be heterozygous in at least one of four human cell samples were investigated by ChIP and sequence analysis (haploChIP). In four of five cases where the SNP was predicted to affect binding, USF1 was preferentially bound to the allele containing the consensus motif. Allelic differences in binding for other proteins and histone marks further reinforced the SNPs regulatory potential. Moreover, for one of these SNPs, H3K36me3 and POLR2A levels at neighboring heterozygous SNPs indicated effects on transcription. Our strategy, which is entirely based on in vivo data for both the prediction and validation steps, can identify individual binding sites at base pair resolution and predict rSNPs. Overall, this approach can help to pinpoint the causative SNPs in complex disorders where the associated haplotypes are located in regulatory regions. BCRANK is available from Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/).
3 Chronic crude garlic-feeding modified adult male rat testicular markers: mechanisms of action. Garlic or Allium sativum (As) shows therapeutic effects such as reduction of blood pressure or hypercholesterolemia but side-effects on reproductive functions remain poorly investigated. Because of garlic's chemical complexity, the processing methods and yield in preparations differ in efficacy and safety. In this context, we clarify the mechanisms of action of crushed crude garlic on testicular markers. During one month of treatment, 24 male rats were fed 5%, 10% and 15% crude garlic. We showed that crude garlic-feeding induced apoptosis in testicular germ cells (spermatocytes and spermatids). This cell death process was characterized by increased levels of active CASP3 but not CASP6. Expression of the caspase inhibitors BIRC3 and BIRC2 was increased at all doses of As while expression of XIAP and BIRC5 was unchanged. Moreover, expression of the IAP inhibitor DIABLO was increased at doses 10% and 15% of As. The germ cell death process induced by As might be related to a decrease in testosterone production because of the reduced expression of steroidogenic enzymes (Star, Cyp11a, Hsd3b5 and Hsd17b). Evaluation of Sertoli markers showed that TUBB3 and GSTA2 expression was unchanged. In contrast, AMH, RHOX5 and CDKN1B expression was decreased while GATA4 expression was increased. In summary, we showed that feeding with crude garlic inhibited Leydig steroidogenic enzyme expression and Sertoli cell markers. These alterations might induce apoptosis in testicular germ cells.
3 The effects of gender and age on health related behaviors. Lifestyle-related diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers represent the greatest global health threat. Greater insight into health needs and beliefs, using broad community samples, is vital to reduce the burden of chronic disease. This study aimed to investigate gender, age, screening practices, health beliefs, and perceived future health needs for healthy ageing. Random probability sampling using self-completion surveys in 1456 adults residing in Australia. Screening behaviors were associated with gender and age. Men and women >51 years were more likely (27%) to have screening health checks than those <50 years (2%). Factors nominated to influence health were lifestyle (92%), relationships (82%), and environment (80%). Women were more likely to nominate preparedness to have an annual health check, willingness to seek advice from their medical practitioner and to attend education sessions. Numerous health fears were associated with ageing, however participants were more likely to have a financial (72%) rather than a health plan (42%). More women and participants >51 years wanted information regarding illness prevention than men or those aged <30 years. Age and gender are associated with health related behaviors. Optimal health is perceived as a priority, yet often this perception is not translated into preventative action. These findings will inform future research and policy makers as we strive towards a healthier ageing society and the prevention of chronic disease.
3 Biodiversity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria from deep sea sediments of the Middle Atlantic Ridge. The bacteria involved in the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in deep sea subsurface environments are largely unknown. In order to reveal their biodiversity, sediments from 2.2 m under the bottom surface at a water depth of 3542 m were sampled on the Middle Atlantic Ridge with a gravity column sampler. The sediments were promptly enriched with either crude oil or a mixture of PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene) as the sole carbon source, and further enriched with the PAH mixture mentioned above in the lab. The resulting consortia were named C2CO and C2PPN respectively. Their bacterial composition was analysed with plate cultivation, PCR-DGGE and 16S rDNA library analysis. On plates, isolates belonging to Pseudoalteromonas, Halomonas, Marinobacter, Thalassospira and Tistrella dominated the culturable populations. With PCR-DGGE, five major bands closely related to Cycloclasticus, Alteromonas, Thalassospira, Alcanivorax and Rhodospirillaceae were detected in consortium C2CO, while only one major band of Cycloclasticus was detected in consortium C2PPN. In addition, the dynamics of community structure in response to aromatic substrate alterations were examined. As a result, three ribotypes of Cycloclasticus were detected by 16S rDNA library analysis, one which played a key role in phenanthrene degradation; two Alteromonas bacteria dominated the naphthalene reselected consortium. Although bacteria of the two genera grew as the main members of the communities, none of them were isolated, probably owing to their poor cultivability. These results confirm that bacteria of Cycloclasticus are important obligate PAH degraders in marine environments, and coexist with other degrading bacteria that inhabit the deep subsurface sediment of the Atlantic. This supports the view that PAH accumulation and bioattenuation occur in remote areas consistently and continuously.
0 Mild forms of hypophosphatasia mostly result from dominant negative effect of severe alleles or from compound heterozygosity for severe and moderate alleles. Mild hypophosphatasia (HPP) phenotype may result from ALPL gene mutations exhibiting residual alkaline phosphatase activity or from severe heterozygous mutations exhibiting a dominant negative effect. In order to determine the cause of our failure to detect a second mutation by sequencing in patients with mild HPP and carrying on a single heterozygous mutation, we tested the possible dominant effect of 35 mutations carried by these patients. We tested the mutations by site-directed mutagenesis. We also genotyped 8 exonic and intronic ALPL gene polymorphisms in the patients and in a control group in order to detect the possible existence of a recurrent intronic mild mutation. We found that most of the tested mutations exhibit a dominant negative effect that may account for the mild HPP phenotype, and that for at least some of the patients, a second mutation in linkage disequilibrium with a particular haplotype could not be ruled out. Mild HPP results in part from compound heterozygosity for severe and moderate mutations, but also in a large part from heterozygous mutations with a dominant negative effect.
1 Construction and characterization of a bovine BAC library with four genome-equivalent coverage. A bovine artificial chromosome (BAC) library of 105 984 clones has been constructed in the vector pBeloBAC11 and organized in 3-dimension pools and high density membranes for screening by PCR and hybridization. The average insert size, determined after analysis of 388 clones, was estimated at 120 kb corresponding to a four genome coverage. Given the fact that a male was used to construct the library, the probability of finding any given autosomal and X or Y locus is respectively 0.98 and 0.86. The library was screened for 164 microsatellite markers and an average of 3.9 superpools was positive for each PCR system. None of the 50 or so BAC clones analysed by FISH was chimeric. This BAC library increases the international genome coverage for cattle to around 28 genome equivalents and extends the coverage of the ruminant genomes available at the Inra resource center to 15 genome equivalents.
1 The preclinical natural history of serous ovarian cancer: defining the target for early detection. Ovarian cancer kills approximately 15,000 women in the United States every year, and more than 140,000 women worldwide. Most deaths from ovarian cancer are caused by tumors of the serous histological type, which are rarely diagnosed before the cancer has spread. Rational design of a potentially life-saving early detection and intervention strategy requires understanding the lesions we must detect in order to prevent lethal progression. Little is known about the natural history of lethal serous ovarian cancers before they become clinically apparent. We can learn about this occult period by studying the unsuspected serous cancers that are discovered in a small fraction of apparently healthy women who undergo prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (PBSO). We developed models for the growth, progression, and detection of occult serous cancers on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of published data on serous cancers discovered by PBSO in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Our analysis yielded several critical insights into the early natural history of serous ovarian cancer. First, these cancers spend on average more than 4 y as in situ, stage I, or stage II cancers and approximately 1 y as stage III or IV cancers before they become clinically apparent. Second, for most of the occult period, serous cancers are less than 1 cm in diameter, and not visible on gross examination of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Third, the median diameter of a serous ovarian cancer when it progresses to an advanced stage (stage III or IV) is about 3 cm. Fourth, to achieve 50% sensitivity in detecting tumors before they advance to stage III, an annual screen would need to detect tumors of 1.3 cm in diameter; 80% detection sensitivity would require detecting tumors less than 0.4 cm in diameter. Fifth, to achieve a 50% reduction in serous ovarian cancer mortality with an annual screen, a test would need to detect tumors of 0.5 cm in diameter. Our analysis has formalized essential conditions for successful early detection of serous ovarian cancer. Although the window of opportunity for early detection of these cancers lasts for several years, developing a test sufficiently sensitive and specific to take advantage of that opportunity will be a challenge. We estimated that the tumors we would need to detect to achieve even 50% sensitivity are more than 200 times smaller than the clinically apparent serous cancers typically used to evaluate performance of candidate biomarkers; none of the biomarker assays reported to date comes close to the required level of performance. Overcoming the signal-to-noise problem inherent in detection of tiny tumors will likely require discovery of truly cancer-specific biomarkers or development of novel approaches beyond traditional blood protein biomarkers. While this study was limited to ovarian cancers of serous histological type and to those arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers specifically, we believe that the results are relevant to other hereditary serous cancers and to sporadic ovarian cancers. A similar approach could be applied to other cancers to aid in defining their early natural history and to guide rational design of an early detection strategy.
0 LD2SNPing: linkage disequilibrium plotter and RFLP enzyme mining for tag SNPs. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping is commonly used to evaluate markers for genome-wide association studies. Most types of LD software focus strictly on LD analysis and visualization, but lack supporting services for genotyping. We developed a freeware called LD2SNPing, which provides a complete package of mining tools for genotyping and LD analysis environments. The software provides SNP ID- and gene-centric online retrievals for SNP information and tag SNP selection from dbSNP/NCBI and HapMap, respectively. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) enzyme information for SNP genotype is available to all SNP IDs and tag SNPs. Single and multiple SNP inputs are possible in order to perform LD analysis by online retrieval from HapMap and NCBI. An LD statistics section provides D, D', r2, deltaQ, rho, and the P values of the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium for each SNP marker, and Chi-square and likelihood-ratio tests for the pair-wise association of two SNPs in LD calculation. Finally, 2D and 3D plots, as well as plain-text output of the results, can be selected. LD2SNPing thus provides a novel visualization environment for multiple SNP input, which facilitates SNP association studies. The software, user manual, and tutorial are freely available at http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/LD2NPing.
1 Novel transthyretin amyloid fibril formation inhibitors: synthesis, biological evaluation, and X-ray structural analysis. Transthyretin (TTR) is one of thirty non-homologous proteins whose misfolding, dissociation, aggregation, and deposition is linked to human amyloid diseases. Previous studies have identified that TTR amyloidogenesis can be inhibited through stabilization of the native tetramer state by small molecule binding to the thyroid hormone sites of TTR. We have evaluated a new series of beta-aminoxypropionic acids (compounds 5-21), with a single aromatic moiety (aryl or fluorenyl) linked through a flexible oxime tether to a carboxylic acid. These compounds are structurally distinct from the native ligand thyroxine and typical halogenated biaryl NSAID-like inhibitors to avoid off-target hormonal or anti-inflammatory activity. Based on an in vitro fibril formation assay, five of these compounds showed significant inhibition of TTR amyloidogenesis, with two fluorenyl compounds displaying inhibitor efficacy comparable to the well-known TTR inhibitor diflunisal. Fluorenyl 15 is the most potent compound in this series and importantly does not show off-target anti-inflammatory activity. Crystal structures of the TTR:inhibitor complexes, in agreement with molecular docking studies, revealed that the aromatic moiety, linked to the sp(2)-hybridized oxime carbon, specifically directed the ligand in either a forward or reverse binding mode. Compared to the aryl family members, the bulkier fluorenyl analogs achieved more extensive interactions with the binding pockets of TTR and demonstrated better inhibitory activity in the fibril formation assay. Preliminary optimization efforts are described that focused on replacement of the C-terminal acid in both the aryl and fluorenyl series (compounds 22-32). The compounds presented here constitute a new class of TTR inhibitors that may hold promise in treating amyloid diseases associated with TTR misfolding.
1 trimAl: a tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses. Multiple sequence alignments are central to many areas of bioinformatics. It has been shown that the removal of poorly aligned regions from an alignment increases the quality of subsequent analyses. Such an alignment trimming phase is complicated in large-scale phylogenetic analyses that deal with thousands of alignments. Here, we present trimAl, a tool for automated alignment trimming, which is especially suited for large-scale phylogenetic analyses. trimAl can consider several parameters, alone or in multiple combinations, for selecting the most reliable positions in the alignment. These include the proportion of sequences with a gap, the level of amino acid similarity and, if several alignments for the same set of sequences are provided, the level of consistency across different alignments. Moreover, trimAl can automatically select the parameters to be used in each specific alignment so that the signal-to-noise ratio is optimized. trimAl has been written in C++, it is portable to all platforms. trimAl is freely available for download (http://trimal.cgenomics.org) and can be used online through the Phylemon web server (http://phylemon2.bioinfo.cipf.es/). Supplementary Material is available at http://trimal.cgenomics.org/publications.
3 Structural genomics is the largest contributor of novel structural leverage. The Protein Structural Initiative (PSI) at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is funding four large-scale centers for structural genomics (SG). These centers systematically target many large families without structural coverage, as well as very large families with inadequate structural coverage. Here, we report a few simple metrics that demonstrate how successfully these efforts optimize structural coverage: while the PSI-2 (2005-now) contributed more than 8% of all structures deposited into the PDB, it contributed over 20% of all novel structures (i.e. structures for protein sequences with no structural representative in the PDB on the date of deposition). The structural coverage of the protein universe represented by today's UniProt (v12.8) has increased linearly from 1992 to 2008; structural genomics has contributed significantly to the maintenance of this growth rate. Success in increasing novel leverage (defined in Liu et al. in Nat Biotechnol 25:849-851, 2007) has resulted from systematic targeting of large families. PSI's per structure contribution to novel leverage was over 4-fold higher than that for non-PSI structural biology efforts during the past 8 years. If the success of the PSI continues, it may just take another approximately15 years to cover most sequences in the current UniProt database.
3 Analysis of airborne betula pollen in Finland; a 31-year perspective. In this 31-year retrospective study, we examined the influence of meteorology on airborne Betula spp. (birch) pollen concentrations in Turku, Finland. The seasonal incidence of airborne birch pollen in Turku occurred over a brief period each year during spring (April 30 - May 31). Mean peak concentrations were restricted to May (May 5 to 13). Statistically significant increases in the annual accumulated birch pollen sum and daily maximum values were observed over the study period. Birch pollen counts collected in April were retrospectively shown to increase over the duration of the study. Increases in April temperature values were also significantly associated with the earlier onset of the birch pollen season. Furthermore, the number of days where daily birch pollen concentrations exceeded 10 and 1,000 grains/m(3) also increased throughout the study period. These data demonstrate that increases in temperature, especially during months preceding the onset of the birch pollen season, favor preseason phenological development and pollen dispersal. Birch pollen derived from other geographical locations may also contribute to the aerospora of Turku, Finland. To date, the public health burden associated with personal exposure to elevated birch pollen loads remains unclear and is the focus of future epidemiological research.
1 Determinants of return to work in patients with hand disorders and hand injuries. Return to work (RTW) in patients with hand disorders and hand injuries is determined by several determinants not directly related to the physical situation. Besides biomedical determinants, work-related and psychosocial determinants may influence RTW as well. This study is conducted to investigate the influence of these potential determinants on RTW in patients with hand disorders and hand injuries. Included 91 patients who were operatively treated for a hand disorder or a hand injury, and who were employed prior to surgery. Patients answered several questionnaires on the aforementioned categories. Potential determinants significantly related to RTW in a univariate analysis were entered in a logistic regression for the total group and the acutely injured patients separately. Pain, accident location, job independence and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were univariately associated with RTW. Pain was a determinant for late RTW in the total group and accident location and symptoms of PTSD in the acutely injured group. Pain, accident location and symptoms of PTSD were most important in resuming work in hand injured patients or in patients with a hand disorder. These findings may indicate that attention should be paid to the treatment of pain, and to the development of symptoms of PTSD during rehabilitation. It may be necessary to make extra efforts aimed at RTW in patients who sustained their injury on the job.
1 Analyzing musculoskeletal neck pain, measured as present pain and periods of pain, with three different regression models: a cohort study. In the literature there are discussions on the choice of outcome and the need for more longitudinal studies of musculoskeletal disorders. The general aim of this longitudinal study was to analyze musculoskeletal neck pain, in a group of young adults. Specific aims were to determine whether psychosocial factors, computer use, high work/study demands, and lifestyle are long-term or short-term factors for musculoskeletal neck pain, and whether these factors are important for developing or ongoing musculoskeletal neck pain. Three regression models were used to analyze the different outcomes. Pain at present was analyzed with a marginal logistic model, for number of years with pain a Poisson regression model was used and for developing and ongoing pain a logistic model was used. Presented results are odds ratios and proportion ratios (logistic models) and rate ratios (Poisson model). The material consisted of web-based questionnaires answered by 1204 Swedish university students from a prospective cohort recruited in 2002. Perceived stress was a risk factor for pain at present (PR = 1.6), for developing pain (PR = 1.7) and for number of years with pain (RR = 1.3). High work/study demands was associated with pain at present (PR = 1.6); and with number of years with pain when the demands negatively affect home life (RR = 1.3). Computer use pattern (number of times/week with a computer session > or = 4 h, without break) was a risk factor for developing pain (PR = 1.7), but also associated with pain at present (PR = 1.4) and number of years with pain (RR = 1.2). Among life style factors smoking (PR = 1.8) was found to be associated to pain at present. The difference between men and women in prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was confirmed in this study. It was smallest for the outcome ongoing pain (PR = 1.4) compared to pain at present (PR = 2.4) and developing pain (PR = 2.5). By using different regression models different aspects of neck pain pattern could be addressed and the risk factors impact on pain pattern was identified. Short-term risk factors were perceived stress, high work/study demands and computer use pattern (break pattern). Those were also long-term risk factors. For developing pain perceived stress and computer use pattern were risk factors.
1 Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy based investigation on propylene glycol toxicosis in a Holstein cow. It is unknown which metabolites are responsible for propylene glycol (PG)-induced toxicosis, and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms explaining incidences of abnormal behaviour of dairy cows fed PG is therefore needed. The study included three cows of which one developed PG toxicosis. In order to investigate how the metabolism of PG differed in the cow developing toxicosis, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was applied on ruminal fluids and blood plasma samples obtained before and after feeding with PG. PG toxicosis was characterized by dyspnea and ruminal atony upon intake of concentrate containing PG. The oxygen saturation of arterial blood haemoglobin and the oxygen pressure in arterial blood decreased along with the appearance of the clinical symptoms. NMR revealed differences in plasma and ruminal content of several metabolites between the cow responding abnormally to PG and the two control cows. It is concluded that PG-toxicosis is likely caused by pulmonary vasoconstriction, but no unusual metabolites directly related to induction of this condition could be detected in the plasma or the ruminal fluid.
1 Expression of heat shock protein 60 kDa is upregulated in cervical cancer. Cervical cancer caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) continues to be the cause of yearly death among women. However, it is a curable disease when diagnosed at an early stage. Recently, several researches have reported that heat shock protein (HSP) 60, a chaperone protein of molecular weight of 60 kDa, is involved in carcinogenesis and apoptosis. In order to evaluate the prognostic significance of HSP60 in cervical cancer, we examined differences in the HSP60 expression between cervical cancer and normal tissues in women. Tissue samples were collected from 20 cervical cancer patients and 20 normal controls. HSP60 expression of cervical cancer and normal tissues were verified by the 2D gel proteomics, semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses. In 2D proteomic analysis, an increase of HSP60 expression was detected in cervical cancer tissues and confirmed by Western blot analysis (p < 0.05). However, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of HSP60 did not display any significant differences between cervical cancer and normal tissues. These results suggest that HSP60 may be involved in the development of cervical cancer and have profound biological and prognostic significance.
0 The logic of EGFR/ErbB signaling: theoretical properties and analysis of high-throughput data. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is probably the best-studied receptor system in mammalian cells, and it also has become a popular example for employing mathematical modeling to cellular signaling networks. Dynamic models have the highest explanatory and predictive potential; however, the lack of kinetic information restricts current models of EGFR signaling to smaller sub-networks. This work aims to provide a large-scale qualitative model that comprises the main and also the side routes of EGFR/ErbB signaling and that still enables one to derive important functional properties and predictions. Using a recently introduced logical modeling framework, we first examined general topological properties and the qualitative stimulus-response behavior of the network. With species equivalence classes, we introduce a new technique for logical networks that reveals sets of nodes strongly coupled in their behavior. We also analyzed a model variant which explicitly accounts for uncertainties regarding the logical combination of signals in the model. The predictive power of this model is still high, indicating highly redundant sub-structures in the network. Finally, one key advance of this work is the introduction of new techniques for assessing high-throughput data with logical models (and their underlying interaction graph). By employing these techniques for phospho-proteomic data from primary hepatocytes and the HepG2 cell line, we demonstrate that our approach enables one to uncover inconsistencies between experimental results and our current qualitative knowledge and to generate new hypotheses and conclusions. Our results strongly suggest that the Rac/Cdc42 induced p38 and JNK cascades are independent of PI3K in both primary hepatocytes and HepG2. Furthermore, we detected that the activation of JNK in response to neuregulin follows a PI3K-dependent signaling pathway.
3 HDAC1 and HDAC2 regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation by disrupting the beta-catenin-TCF interaction. Oligodendrocyte development is regulated by the interaction of repressors and activators in a complex transcriptional network. We found that two histone-modifying enzymes, HDAC1 and HDAC2, were required for oligodendrocyte formation. Genetic deletion of both Hdac1 and Hdac2 in oligodendrocyte lineage cells resulted in stabilization and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, which negatively regulates oligodendrocyte development by repressing Olig2 expression. We further identified the oligodendrocyte-restricted transcription factor TCF7L2/TCF4 as a bipartite co-effector of beta-catenin for regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation. Targeted disruption of Tcf7l2 in mice led to severe defects in oligodendrocyte maturation, whereas expression of its dominant-repressive form promoted precocious oligodendrocyte specification in developing chick neural tube. Transcriptional co-repressors HDAC1 and HDAC2 compete with beta-catenin for TCF7L2 interaction to regulate downstream genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation. Thus, crosstalk between HDAC1/2 and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway mediated by TCF7L2 serves as a regulatory mechanism for oligodendrocyte differentiation.
1 Coming home to die? The association between migration and mortality in rural South Africa. Studies on migration often ignore the health and social impact of migrants returning to their rural communities. Several studies have shown migrants to be particularly susceptible to HIV infection. This paper investigates whether migrants to rural households have a higher risk of dying, especially from HIV, than non-migrants. Using data from a large and ongoing Demographic Surveillance System, 41,517 adults, enumerated in bi-annual rounds between 2001 and 2005, and aged 18 to 60 years were categorized into four groups: external in-migrants, internal migrants, out-migrants and residents. The risk of dying by migration status was quantified by Cox proportional hazard regression. In a sub-group analysis of 1212 deaths which occurred in 2000 - 2001 and for which cause of death information was available, the relationship between migration status and dying from AIDS was examined in logistic regression. In all, 618 deaths were recorded among 7,867 external in-migrants, 255 among 4,403 internal migrants, 310 among 11,476 out-migrants and 1900 deaths were registered among 17,771 residents. External in-migrants were 28% more likely to die than residents [adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) = 1.28, P < 0.001, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (1.16, 1.41)]. In the sub-group analysis, the odds of dying from AIDS was 1.79 [adjusted Odd ratio (aOR) = 1.79, P = 0.009, 95% CI (1.15, 2.78)] for external in-migrants compared to residents; there was no statistically significant difference in AIDS mortality between residents and out-migrants, [aOR = 1.25, P = 0.533, 95% CI (0.62-2.53)]. Independently, females were more likely to die from AIDS than males [aOR = 2.35, P < 0.001, 95% CI (1.79, 3.08)]. External in-migrants have a higher risk of dying, especially from HIV related causes, than residents, and in areas with substantial migration this needs to be taken into account in evaluating mortality statistics and planning health care services.
3 Gene and microRNA analysis of neutrophils from patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocytosis: down-regulation of micro RNA-1 and -133a. Since the V617F mutation in JAK2 may not be the initiating event in myeloprofilerative disorders (MPDs) we compared molecular changes in neutrophils from patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythosis (ET), to neutrophils stimulated by G-CSF administration and to normal unstimulated neutrophils A gene expression oligonucleotide microarray with more than 35,000 probes and a microRNA (miR) expression array with 827 probes were used to assess neutrophils from 6 MPD patients; 4 with PV and 2 with ET, 5 healthy subjects and 6 healthy subjects given G-CSF. In addition, neutrophil antigen expression was analyzed by flow cytometry and 64 serum protein levels were analyzed by ELISA. Gene expression profiles of neutrophils from the MPD patients were similar but distinct from those of healthy subjects, either unstimulated or G-CSF-mobilized. The differentially expressed genes in MPD neutrophils were more likely to be in pathways involved with inflammation while those of G-CSF-mobilized neutrophils were more likely to belong to metabolic pathways. In MPD neutrophils the expression of CCR1 was increased and that of several NF-kappaB pathway genes were decreased. MicroRNA miR-133a and miR-1 in MPD neutrophils were down-regulated the most. Levels of 11 serum proteins were increased in MPD patients including MMP-10, MMP-13, VCAM, P-selectin, PDGF-BB and a CCR1 ligand, MIP-1alpha. These studies showed differential expression of genes particularly involved in inflammatory pathways including the NF-kappaB pathway and down-regulation of miR-133a and miR-1. These two microRNAs have been previous associated with certain cancers as well as the regulation of hyperthrophy of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. These changes may contribute to the clinical manifestations of the MPDs.
3 The evolution of YidC/Oxa/Alb3 family in the three domains of life: a phylogenomic analysis. YidC/Oxa/Alb3 family includes a group of conserved translocases that are essential for protein insertion into inner membranes of bacteria and mitochondria, and thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Because mitochondria and chloroplasts are of bacterial origin, Oxa and Alb3, like many other mitochondrial/chloroplastic proteins, are hypothetically derived from the pre-existing protein (YidC) of bacterial endosymbionts. Here, we test this hypothesis and investigate the evolutionary history of the whole YidC/Oxa/Alb3 family in the three domains of life. Our comprehensive analyses of the phylogenetic distribution and phylogeny of the YidC/Oxa/Alb3 family lead to the following findings: 1) In archaea, YidC homologs are only sporadically distributed in Euryarchaeota; 2) Most bacteria contain only one YidC gene copy; some species in a few taxa (Bacillus, Lactobacillales, Actinobacteria and Clostridia) have two gene copies; 3) Eukaryotic Oxa and Alb3 have two separate prokaryotic origins, but they might not arise directly from the YidC of proteobacteria and cyanobacteria through the endosymbiosis origins of mitochondrium and chloroplast, respectively; 4) An ancient duplication occurred on both Oxa and Alb3 immediately after their origins, and thus most eukaryotes generally bear two Oxa and two Alb3. However, secondary loss, duplication or acquisition of new domain also occurred on the two genes in some lineages, especially in protists, resulting in a rich diversity or adaptive differentiation of the two translocases in these lineages. YidC is distributed in bacteria and some Euryarchaeota. Although mitochondrial Oxa and chloroplastic Alb3 are derived from the prokaryotic YidC, their origin might be not related to the endosymbiosis events of the two organelles. In some eukaryotic lineages, especially in protists, Oxa and Alb3 have diverse evolutionary histories. Finally, a model for the evolutionary history of the entire YidC/Oxa/Alb3 family in the three domains of life is proposed.
2 Differential expression patterns of occ1-related genes in adult monkey visual cortex. We have previously revealed that occ1 is preferentially expressed in the primary visual area (V1) of the monkey neocortex. In our attempt to identify more area-selective genes in the macaque neocortex, we found that testican-1, an occ1-related gene, and its family members also exhibit characteristic expression patterns along the visual pathway. The expression levels of testican-1 and testican-2 mRNAs as well as that of occ1 mRNA start of high in V1, progressively decrease along the ventral visual pathway, and end of low in the temporal areas. Complementary to them, the neuronal expression of SPARC mRNA is abundant in the association areas and scarce in V1. Whereas occ1, testican-1, and testican-2 mRNAs are preferentially distributed in thalamorecipient layers including "blobs," SPARC mRNA expression avoids these layers. Neither SC1 nor testican-3 mRNA expression is selective to particular areas, but SC1 mRNA is abundantly observed in blobs. The expressions of occ1, testican-1, testican-2, and SC1 mRNA were downregulated after monocular tetrodotoxin injection. These results resonate with previous works on chemical and functional gradients along the primate occipitotemporal visual pathway and raise the possibility that these gradients and functional architecture may be related to the visual activity-dependent expression of these extracellular matrix glycoproteins.
0 The regulation of MS-KIF18A expression and cross talk with estrogen receptor. This study provides a novel view on the interactions between the MS-KIF18A, a kinesin protein, and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) which were studied in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, the regulation of MS-KIF18A expression by estrogen was investigated at the gene and protein levels. An association between recombinant proteins; ERalpha and MS-KIF18A was demonstrated in vitro in a pull down assay. Such interactions were proven also for endogenous proteins in MBA-15 cells were detected prominently in the cytoplasm and are up-regulated by estrogen. Additionally, an association between these proteins and the transcription factor NF-kappaB was identified. MS-KIF18A mRNA expression was measured in vivo in relation to age and estrogen level in mice and rats models. A decrease in MS-KIF18A mRNA level was measured in old and in OVX-estrogen depleted rats as compared to young animals. The low MS-KIF18A mRNA expression in OVX rats was restored by estrogen treatment. We studied the regulation of MS-KIF18A transcription by estrogen using the luciferase reporter gene and chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assays. The luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated an increase in MS-KIF18A promoter activity in response to 10(-8) M estrogen and 10(-7)M ICI-182,780. Complimentary, the ChIP assay quantified the binding of ERalpha and pcJun to the MS-KIF18A promoter that was enhanced in cells treated by estrogen and ICI-182,780. In addition, cells treated by estrogen expressed higher levels of MS-KIF18A mRNA and protein and the protein turnover in MBA-15 cells was accelerated. Presented data demonstrated that ERalpha is a defined cargo of MS-KIF18A and added novel insight on the role of estrogen in regulation of MS-KIF18A expression both in vivo and in vitro.
2 Aphrodisiac activity of 50% ethanolic extracts of Myristica fragrans Houtt. (nutmeg) and Syzygium aromaticum (L) Merr. & Perry. (clove) in male mice: a comparative study. Spices are considered as sexual invigorators in the Unani System of Medicine. In order to explore the sexual function improving effect of Myristica fragrans Houtt. (nutmeg) and Syzygium aromaticum (L) Merr. & Perry. (clove) an experimental study was conducted in normal male mice. The extracts (50% ethanolic) of nutmeg and clove were administered (500 mg/kg; p.o.) to different groups of male Swiss mice. Mounting behaviour, mating performance, and general short term toxicity of the test drugs were determined and compared with the standard drug Penegra (Sildenafil citrate). The extracts of the nutmeg and clove were found to stimulate the mounting behaviour of male mice, and also to significantly increase their mating performance. The drugs were devoid of any conspicuous general short term toxicity. The extracts (50% ethanolic) of nutmeg and clove enhanced the sexual behaviour of male mice.
1 Fast simultaneous detection of K-RAS mutations in colorectal cancer. RAS genes acquire the most common somatic gain-of-function mutations in human cancer, and almost all of these mutations are located at codons 12, 13, 61, and 146. We present a method for detecting these K-RAS hotspot mutations in 228 cases of colorectal cancer. The protocol is based on the multiplex amplification of exons 2, 3 and 4 in a single tube, followed by primer extension of the PCR products using various sizes of primers to detect base changes at codons 12, 13, 61 and 146. We compared the clinicopathological data of colorectal cancer patients with the K-RAS mutation status. K-RAS mutation occurred in 36% (83/228) of our colorectal cancer cases. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between K-RAS mutation at codon 12 of exon 2 and poor 5-year survival (p = 0.023) and lymph node involvement (p = 0.048). Also, K-RAS mutation at codon 13 of exon 2 correlates with the size of the tumor (p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis adjusted for tumor size, histologic grade, and lymph node metastasis also indicated K-RAS mutations at codon 12 and 13 of exon 2 correlate significantly with overall survival (p = 0.002 and 0.025). No association was observed between codon 61 and 146 and clinicopathological features. We demonstrated a simple and fast way to identify K-RAS mutation.
0 The Drosophila deoxyhypusine hydroxylase homologue nero and its target eIF5A are required for cell growth and the regulation of autophagy. Hypusination is a unique posttranslational modification by which lysine is transformed into the atypical amino acid hypusine. eIF5A (eukaryotic initiation factor 5A) is the only known protein to contain hypusine. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of nero, the Drosophila melanogaster deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) homologue. nero mutations affect cell and organ size, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and autophagy. Knockdown of the hypusination target eIF5A via RNA interference causes phenotypes similar to nero mutations. However, loss of nero appears to cause milder phenotypes than loss of eIF5A. This is partially explained through a potential compensatory mechanism by which nero mutant cells up-regulate eIF5A levels. The failure of eIF5A up-regulation to rescue nero mutant phenotypes suggests that hypusination is required for eIF5A function. Furthermore, expression of enzymatically impaired forms of DOHH fails to rescue nero clones, indicating that hypusination activity is important for nero function. Our data also indicate that nero and eIF5A are required for cell growth and affect autophagy and protein synthesis.
0 Functional and antigenic properties of GlpO from Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC: characterization of a flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding site deletion mutant. L-alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase (GlpO) plays a central role in virulence of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC, a severe bacterial pathogen causing contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP). It is involved in production and translocation of toxic H(2)O(2) into the host cell, causing inflammation and cell death. The binding site on GlpO for the cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) has been identified as Gly(12)-Gly(13)-Gly(14)-Ile(15)-Ile(16)-Gly(17). Recombinant GlpO lacking these six amino acids (GlpODeltaFAD) was unable to bind FAD and was also devoid of glycerophosphate oxidase activity, in contrast to non-modified recombinant GlpO that binds FAD and is enzymatically active. Polyclonal monospecific antibodies directed against GlpODeltaFAD, similarly to anti-GlpO antibodies, neutralised H(2)O(2) production of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC grown in the presence of glycerol, as well as cytotoxicity towards embryonic calf nasal epithelial (ECaNEp) cells. The FAD-binding site of GlpO is therefore suggested as a valuable target site for the future construction of deletion mutants to yield attenuated live vaccines of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC necessary to efficiently combat CBPP.
0 Parental diabetes status reveals association of mitochondrial DNA haplogroup J1 with type 2 diabetes. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is consistently manifested in patients with Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the association of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variants with T2DM varies among populations. These differences might stem from differing environmental influences among populations. However, other potentially important considerations emanate from the very nature of mitochondrial genetics, namely the notable high degree of partitioning in the distribution of human mtDNA variants among populations, as well as the interaction of mtDNA and nuclear DNA-encoded factors working in concert to govern mitochondrial function. We hypothesized that association of mtDNA genetic variants with T2DM could be revealed while controlling for the effect of additional inherited factors, reflected in family history information. To test this hypothesis we set out to investigate whether mtDNA genetic variants will be differentially associated with T2DM depending on the diabetes status of the parents. To this end, association of mtDNA genetic backgrounds (haplogroups) with T2DM was assessed in 1055 Jewish patients with and without T2DM parents ('DP' and 'HP', respectively). Haplogroup J1 was found to be 2.4 fold under-represented in the 'HP' patients (p = 0.0035). These results are consistent with a previous observation made in Finnish T2DM patients. Moreover, assessing the haplogroup distribution in 'DP' versus 'HP' patients having diabetic siblings revealed that haplogroup J1 was virtually absent in the 'HP' group. These results imply the involvement of inherited factors, which modulate the susceptibility of haplogroup J1 to T2DM.
1 Inference of gene pathways using mixture Bayesian networks. Inference of gene networks typically relies on measurements across a wide range of conditions or treatments. Although one network structure is predicted, the relationship between genes could vary across conditions. A comprehensive approach to infer general and condition-dependent gene networks was evaluated. This approach integrated Bayesian network and Gaussian mixture models to describe continuous microarray gene expression measurements, and three gene networks were predicted. The first reconstructions of a circadian rhythm pathway in honey bees and an adherens junction pathway in mouse embryos were obtained. In addition, general and condition-specific gene relationships, some unexpected, were detected in these two pathways and in a yeast cell-cycle pathway. The mixture Bayesian network approach identified all (honey bee circadian rhythm and mouse adherens junction pathways) or the vast majority (yeast cell-cycle pathway) of the gene relationships reported in empirical studies. Findings across the three pathways and data sets indicate that the mixture Bayesian network approach is well-suited to infer gene pathways based on microarray data. Furthermore, the interpretation of model estimates provided a broader understanding of the relationships between genes. The mixture models offered a comprehensive description of the relationships among genes in complex biological processes or across a wide range of conditions. The mixture parameter estimates and corresponding odds that the gene network inferred for a sample pertained to each mixture component allowed the uncovering of both general and condition-dependent gene relationships and patterns of expression. This study demonstrated the two main benefits of learning gene pathways using mixture Bayesian networks. First, the identification of the optimal number of mixture components supported by the data offered a robust approach to infer gene relationships and estimate gene expression profiles. Second, the classification of conditions and observations into groups that support particular mixture components helped to uncover both gene relationships that are unique or common across conditions. Results from the application of mixture Bayesian networks substantially augmented the understanding of gene networks and demonstrated the added-value of this methodology to infer gene networks.
2 A new minimal-stress freely-moving rat model for preclinical studies on intranasal administration of CNS drugs. To develop a new minimal-stress model for intranasal administration in freely moving rats and to evaluate in this model the brain distribution of acetaminophen following intranasal versus intravenous administration. Male Wistar rats received one intranasal cannula, an intra-cerebral microdialysis probe, and two blood cannulas for drug administration and serial blood sampling respectively. To evaluate this novel model, the following experiments were conducted. 1) Evans Blue was administered to verify the selectivity of intranasal exposure. 2) During a 1 min infusion 10, 20, or 40 microl saline was administered intranasally or 250 microl intravenously. Corticosterone plasma concentrations over time were compared as biomarkers for stress. 3) 200 microg of the model drug acetaminophen was given in identical setup and plasma, and brain pharmacokinetics were determined. In 96% of the rats, only the targeted nasal cavity was deeply colored. Corticosterone plasma concentrations were not influenced, neither by route nor volume of administration. Pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen were identical after intravenous and intranasal administration, although the Cmax in microdialysates was reached a little earlier following intravenous administration. A new minimal-stress model for intranasal administration in freely moving rats has been successfully developed and allows direct comparison with intravenous administration.
2 Combination of apigenin treatment with therapeutic HPV DNA vaccination generates enhanced therapeutic antitumor effects. It is important to develop innovative therapies for advanced stage cancers in addition to the conventional therapies including chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. Antigen-specific immunotherapy has emerged as a novel alternate therapy for advanced stage cancers, which may be employed in conjunction with conventional therapies. In the current study, we tested the effect of treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent, apigenin in combination with DNA vaccines encoding the HPV-16 E7 antigen linked to heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in the control of the E7-expressing tumor, TC-1. We observed that treatment with apigenin rendered the TC-1 tumor cells more susceptible to lysis by E7-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, treatment of TC-1 tumor cells with apigenin was found to enhance apoptotic tumor cell death in vitro in a dose-dependant manner. We showed that TC-1 tumor-bearing mice treated with apigenin combined with E7-HSP70 DNA generate highest frequency of primary and memory E7-specific CD8+ T cells, leading to potent therapeutic anti-tumor effects against E7-expressing tumors. Thus, apigenin represents a promising chemotherapeutic agent, which may be used in combination with immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced stage cancers. The clinical implications of the current strategy are discussed.
2 Optimising corticosteroid injection for lateral epicondylalgia with the addition of physiotherapy: a protocol for a randomised control trial with placebo comparison. Corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy are two commonly prescribed interventions for management of lateral epicondylalgia. Corticosteroid injections are the most clinically efficacious in the short term but are associated with high recurrence rates and delayed recovery, while physiotherapy is similar to injections at 6 weeks but with significantly lower recurrence rates. Whilst practitioners frequently recommend combining physiotherapy and injection to overcome harmful effects and improve outcomes, study of the benefits of this combination of treatments is lacking. Clinicians are also faced with the paradox that the powerful anti-inflammatory corticosteroid injections work well, albeit in the short term, for a non-inflammatory condition like lateral epicondylalgia. Surprisingly, these injections have not been rigorously tested against placebo injections. This study primarily addresses both of these issues. A randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design will evaluate the clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness and recurrence rates of adding physiotherapy to an injection. In addition, the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of corticosteroid injection beyond that of a placebo saline injection will be studied. 132 participants with a diagnosis of lateral epicondylalgia will be randomly assigned by concealed allocation to one of four treatment groups - corticosteroid injection, saline injection, corticosteroid injection with physiotherapy or saline injection with physiotherapy. Physiotherapy will comprise 8 sessions of elbow manipulation and exercise over an 8 week period. Blinded follow-up assessments will be conducted at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 26 and 52 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome will be a participant rating of global improvement, from which measures of success and recurrence will be derived. Analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis using linear mixed and logistic regression models. Healthcare costs will be collected from a societal perspective, and along with willingness-to-pay and quality of life data will facilitate cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses. This trial will utilise high quality trial methodologies in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Findings from this study will assist in the development of evidence based practice recommendations and potentially the optimisation of resource allocation for rehabilitating lateral epicondylalgia.

2 Changes in white matter as determinant of global functional decline in older independent outpatients: three year follow-up of LADIS (leukoaraiosis and disability) study cohort. To assess the impairment in daily living activities in older people with age related changes in white matter according to the severity of these changes. Observational data collection and follow-up of a cohort of older people undergoing brain magnetic resonance imaging after non-disabling complaints. 11 European centres. 639 non-disabled older patients (mean age 74.1 (SD 5.0), 45.1% men) in whom brain magnetic resonance imaging showed mild, moderate, or severe age related changes in white matter (Fazekas scale). Magnetic resonance imaging assessment also included cerebral infarcts and atrophy. Transition from no disability (defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the instrumental activities of daily living scale) to disability (score >/=2) or death over three year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were incident dementia and stroke. Over a mean follow-up period of 2.42 years (SD 0.97, median 2.94 years), information on the main outcome was available for 633 patients. The annual rate of transition or death was 10.5%, 15.1%, and 29.5%, respectively, for patients with mild, moderate, or severe age related changes in white matter (Kaplan-Meier log rank test P<0.001). In a Cox model comparing severe with mild changes and adjusted for clinical factors of functional decline, the risk of transition to disability or death was more than twofold higher (hazard ratio 2.36, 95% confidence interval 1.65 to 3.81). The other predictors were age group, history of atrial fibrillation, and complaint of gait disturbances. The effect of severe changes remained significant independently of baseline degree of atrophy and number of infarcts. Incident stroke and dementia only slightly modified this effect. The three year results of the LADIS study suggest that in older adults who seek medical attention for non-disabling complaints, severe age related changes in white matter independently and strongly predict rapid global functional decline.
3 Influenza-like illness sentinel surveillance in Peru. Acute respiratory illnesses and influenza-like illnesses (ILI) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite the public health importance, little is known about the etiology of these acute respiratory illnesses in many regions of South America. In 2006, the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MoH) and the US Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (NMRCD) initiated a collaboration to characterize the viral agents associated with ILI and to describe the clinical and epidemiological presentation of the affected population. Patients with ILI (fever > or =38 degrees C and cough or sore throat) were evaluated in clinics and hospitals in 13 Peruvian cities representative of the four main regions of the country. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, as well as epidemiological and demographic data, were collected from each patient. During the two years of this study (June 2006 through May 2008), a total of 6,835 patients, with a median age of 13 years, were recruited from 31 clinics and hospitals; 6,308 were enrolled by regular passive surveillance and 527 were enrolled as part of outbreak investigations. At least one respiratory virus was isolated from the specimens of 2,688 (42.6%) patients, with etiologies varying by age and geographical region. Overall the most common viral agents isolated were influenza A virus (25.1%), influenza B virus (9.7%), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, (HPIV-1,-2,-3; 3.2%), herpes simplex virus (HSV; 2.6%), and adenoviruses (1.8%). Genetic analyses of influenza virus isolates demonstrated that three lineages of influenza A H1N1, one lineage of influenza A H3N2, and two lineages of influenza B were circulating in Peru during the course of this study. To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive study to date of the etiologic agents associated with ILI in Peru. These results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory pathogens are circulating in Peru and this fact needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients reporting with ILI. Furthermore, these data have implications for influenza vaccine design and implementation in South America.
2 Fibrinous anterior uveitis following laser in situ keratomileusis. A 29-year-old woman who underwent laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for myopic astigmatism in both eyes presented with severe pain, photophobia and decreased visual acuity in the left eye eight days after surgery. Examination revealed severe anterior uveitis with fibrinous exudates in the anterior chamber, flap edema and epithelial bullae. Laboratory investigations for uveitis were negative and the patient required systemic and intensive topical steroids with cycloplegics to control the inflammation. This case demonstrates that severe anterior uveitis may develop after LASIK and needs prompt and vigorous management for resolution.
2 Excitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to left dorsal premotor cortex enhances motor consolidation of new skills. Following practice of skilled movements, changes continue to take place in the brain that both strengthen and modify memory for motor learning. These changes represent motor memory consolidation a process whereby new memories are transformed from a fragile to a more permanent, robust and stable state. In the present study, the neural correlates of motor memory consolidation were probed using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Participants engaged in four days of continuous tracking practice that immediately followed either excitatory 5 HZ, inhibitory 1 HZ or control, sham rTMS. A delayed retention test assessed motor learning of repeated and random sequences of continuous movement; no rTMS was applied at retention. We discovered that 5 HZ excitatory rTMS to PMd stimulated motor memory consolidation as evidenced by off-line learning, whereas only memory stabilization was noted following 1 Hz inhibitory or sham stimulation. Our data support the hypothesis that PMd is important for continuous motor learning, specifically via off-line consolidation of learned motor behaviors.
1 Antimicrobial breakpoint estimation accounting for variability in pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) indices are increasingly being used in the microbiological field to assess the efficacy of a dosing regimen. In contrast to methods using MIC, PK/PD-based methods reflect in vivo conditions and are more predictive of efficacy. Unfortunately, they entail the use of one PK-derived value such as AUC or Cmax and may thus lead to biased efficiency information when the variability is large. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment by adjusting classical breakpoint estimation methods to the situation of variable PK profiles. We propose a logical generalisation of the usual AUC methods by introducing the concept of "efficiency" for a PK profile, which involves the efficacy function as a weight. We formulated these methods for both classes of concentration- and time-dependent antibiotics. Using drug models and in silico approaches, we provide a theoretical basis for characterizing the efficiency of a PK profile under in vivo conditions. We also used the particular case of variable drug intake to assess the effect of the variable PK profiles generated and to analyse the implications for breakpoint estimation. Compared to traditional methods, our weighted AUC approach gives a more powerful PK/PD link and reveals, through examples, interesting issues about the uniqueness of therapeutic outcome indices and antibiotic resistance problems.
1 Epidemiology of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: prevalence, severity, determinants, and the importance of race/ethnicity. Studies that contributed to the epidemiology of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy have reported conflicting findings, and often failed to account for all possible co-variables necessary to evaluate the multidimensional associations. The objectives of this study were to: 1) Estimate the prevalence and the severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy during the 1st and the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, and 2) Identify determinants of presence and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy during the 1st and 2nd trimesters separately, with a special emphasis on the impact of race/ethnicity. A prospective study including pregnant women attending the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine or René-Laennec clinics for their prenatal care was conducted from 2004 to 2006. Women were eligible if they were > or = 18 years of age, and </= 16 weeks of gestation. Women were asked to fill out a 1st trimester self-administered questionnaire and were interviewed over the telephone during their 2nd trimester of pregnancy. Presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy was based on the reporting of pregnant women (yes/no); severity of symptoms was measured by the validated modified-PUQE index. Of the 367 women included in the study, 81.2% were Caucasians, 10.1% Blacks, 4.6% Hispanics, and 4.1% Asians. Multivariate analyses showed that race/ethnicity was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of reporting nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (Asians vs. Caucasians OR: 0.13; 95%CI 0.02-0.73; and Blacks vs. Caucasians OR: 0.29; 95%CI 0.09-0.99). Our study showed that race/ethnicity was associated with the reporting of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in the 1st trimester of pregnancy.
3 Understanding oceanic migrations with intrinsic biogeochemical markers. Migratory marine vertebrates move annually across remote oceanic water masses crossing international borders. Many anthropogenic threats such as overfishing, bycatch, pollution or global warming put millions of marine migrants at risk especially during their long-distance movements. Therefore, precise knowledge about these migratory movements to understand where and when these animals are more exposed to human impacts is vital for addressing marine conservation issues. Because electronic tracking devices suffer from several constraints, mainly logistical and financial, there is emerging interest in finding appropriate intrinsic markers, such as the chemical composition of inert tissues, to study long-distance migrations and identify wintering sites. Here, using tracked pelagic seabirds and some of their own feathers which were known to be grown at different places and times within the annual cycle, we proved the value of biogeochemical analyses of inert tissue as tracers of marine movements and habitat use. Analyses of feathers grown in summer showed that both stable isotope signatures and element concentrations can signal the origin of breeding birds feeding in distinct water masses. However, only stable isotopes signalled water masses used during winter because elements mainly accumulated during the long breeding period are incorporated into feathers grown in both summer and winter. Our findings shed new light on the simple and effective assignment of marine organisms to distinct oceanic areas, providing new opportunities to study unknown migration patterns of secretive species, including in relation to human-induced mortality on specific populations in the marine environment.
1 Clinical predictors of early second event in patients with clinically isolated syndrome. This study aimed to determine the predictors of increased risk of a second demyelinating event within the first year of an initial demyelinating event (IDE) suggestive of early multiple sclerosis (MS). Patients with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) seen at the UCSF MS Center within one year of the IDE were studied. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to analyze predictors of having a second event within 1 year of the IDE. Of 330 patients with MS/CIS, 111 had a second event within 1 year. Non-white race/ethnicity (HR = 2.39, 95% CI [1.58, 3.60], p < 0.0001) and younger age (HR for each 10-year decrease in age = 1.51, 95% CI [1.28, 1.80], p < 0.0001) were strongly associated with an increased risk of having a second event within one year of onset. Having a lower number of functional systems affected by the IDE was also associated with an increased risk of early second event (HR for every one less FS involved = 1.31, 95% CI [1.06, 1.61], p = 0.011). These results were similar after adjusting for treatment of the IDE with steroids and disease-modifying therapy. Non-white race/ethnicity, younger age, and a lower number of FS affected by the IDE are associated with a substantially increased hazard ratio for a second demyelinating event within 1 year. Since early relapse is predictive of worse long-term outcome, identifying and treating such patients after the IDE may be of benefit to them.
1 Using chemical organization theory for model checking. The increasing number and complexity of biomodels makes automatic procedures for checking the models' properties and quality necessary. Approaches like elementary mode analysis, flux balance analysis, deficiency analysis and chemical organization theory (OT) require only the stoichiometric structure of the reaction network for derivation of valuable information. In formalisms like Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), however, information about the stoichiometric coefficients required for an analysis of chemical organizations can be hidden in kinetic laws. First, we introduce an algorithm that uncovers stoichiometric information that might be hidden in the kinetic laws of a reaction network. This allows us to apply OT to SBML models using modifiers. Second, using the new algorithm, we performed a large-scale analysis of the 185 models contained in the manually curated BioModels Database. We found that for 41 models (22%) the set of organizations changes when modifiers are considered correctly. We discuss one of these models in detail (BIOMD149, a combined model of the ERK- and Wnt-signaling pathways), whose set of organizations drastically changes when modifiers are considered. Third, we found inconsistencies in 5 models (3%) and identified their characteristics. Compared with flux-based methods, OT is able to identify those species and reactions more accurately [in 26 cases (14%)] that can be present in a long-term simulation of the model. We conclude that our approach is a valuable tool that helps to improve the consistency of biomodels and their repositories. All data and a JAVA applet to check SBML-models is available from http://www.minet.uni-jena.de/csb/prj/ot/tools. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
3 COFECO: composite function annotation enriched by protein complex data. COFECO is a web-based tool for a composite annotation of protein complexes, KEGG pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) terms within a class of genes and their orthologs under study. Widely used functional enrichment tools using GO and KEGG pathways create large list of annotations that make it difficult to derive consolidated information and often include over-generalized terms. The interrelationship of annotation terms can be more clearly delineated by integrating the information of physically interacting proteins with biological pathways and GO terms. COFECO has the following advanced characteristics: (i) The composite annotation sets of correlated functions and cellular processes for a given gene set can be identified in a more comprehensive and specified way by the employment of protein complex data together with GO and KEGG pathways as annotation resources. (ii) Orthology based integrative annotations among different species complement the defective annotations in an individual genome and provide the information of evolutionary conserved correlations. (iii) A term filtering feature enables users to collect the specified annotations enriched with selected function terms. (iv) A cross-comparison of annotation results between two different datasets is possible. In addition, COFECO provides a web-based GO hierarchical viewer and KEGG pathway viewer where the enrichment results can be summarized and further explored. COFECO is freely accessible at http://piech.kaist.ac.kr/cofeco.
1 UniPrime2: a web service providing easier Universal Primer design. The UniPrime2 web server is a publicly available online resource which automatically designs large sets of universal primers when given a gene reference ID or Fasta sequence input by a user. UniPrime2 works by automatically retrieving and aligning homologous sequences from GenBank, identifying regions of conservation within the alignment, and generating suitable primers that can be used to amplify variable genomic regions. In essence, UniPrime2 is a suite of publicly available software packages (Blastn, T-Coffee, GramAlign, Primer3), which reduces the laborious process of primer design, by integrating these programs into a single software pipeline. Hence, UniPrime2 differs from previous primer design web services in that all steps are automated, linked, saved and phylogenetically delimited, only requiring a single user-defined gene reference ID or input sequence. We provide an overview of the web service and wet-laboratory validation of the primers generated. The system is freely accessible at: http://uniprime.batlab.eu.

3 Microcephalin and pericentrin regulate mitotic entry via centrosome-associated Chk1. Primary microcephaly, Seckel syndrome, and microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II) are disorders exhibiting marked microcephaly, with small brain sizes reflecting reduced neuron production during fetal life. Although primary microcephaly can be caused by mutations in microcephalin (MCPH1), cells from patients with Seckel syndrome and MOPD II harbor mutations in ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) or pericentrin (PCNT), leading to disturbed ATR signaling. In this study, we show that a lack of MCPH1 or PCNT results in a loss of Chk1 from centrosomes with subsequently deregulated activation of centrosomal cyclin B-Cdk1.
3 Flexible heteroarotinoid (Flex-Het) SHetA2 inhibits angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Flexible heteroarotinoids (Flex-Hets) compounds regulate growth, differentiation and apoptosis in cancer cells. The hypothesis of this study was that the lead Flex-Het, SHetA2, inhibits angiogenesis by blocking cytokine release from cancer cells. SHetA2 altered secretion of thrombospondin-4 (TSP-4), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) proteins from normal and cancerous ovarian and renal cultures. Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) expression was inhibited in cancer, but not normal cultures. Endothelial tube formation was stimulated by conditioned media from cancer but not normal cultures, and SHetA2 reduced secretion of this angiogenic activity. SHetA2 directly inhibited endothelial cell tube formation and proliferation through G1 cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis. Recombinant TP reversed SHetA2 anti-angiogenic activity. SHetA2 inhibition of in vivo angiogenesis was observed in Caki-1 renal cancer xenografts. In conclusion, SHetA2 inhibits angiogenesis through alteration of angiogenic factor secretion by cancer cells and through direct effects on endothelial cells.
0 RAD51C facilitates checkpoint signaling by promoting CHK2 phosphorylation. The RAD51 paralogues act in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway of DNA repair. Human RAD51C (hRAD51C) participates in branch migration and Holliday junction resolution and thus is important for processing HR intermediates late in the DNA repair process. Evidence for early involvement of RAD51 during DNA repair also exists, but its function in this context is not understood. In this study, we demonstrate that RAD51C accumulates at DNA damage sites concomitantly with the RAD51 recombinase and is retained after RAD51 disassembly, which is consistent with both an early and a late function for RAD51C. RAD51C recruitment depends on ataxia telangiectasia mutated, NBS1, and replication protein A, indicating it functions after DNA end resection but before RAD51 assembly. Furthermore, we find that RAD51C is required for activation of the checkpoint kinase CHK2 and cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. This suggests that hRAD51C contributes to the protection of genome integrity by transducing DNA damage signals in addition to engaging the HR machinery.
3 Mitotic control of kinetochore-associated dynein and spindle orientation by human Spindly. Mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation depend critically on kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) interactions. A new protein, termed Spindly in Drosophila and SPDL-1 in C. elegans, was recently shown to regulate KT localization of dynein, but depletion phenotypes revealed striking differences, suggesting evolutionarily diverse roles of mitotic dynein. By characterizing the function of Spindly in human cells, we identify specific functions for KT dynein. We show that localization of human Spindly (hSpindly) to KTs is controlled by the Rod/Zw10/Zwilch (RZZ) complex and Aurora B. hSpindly depletion results in reduced inter-KT tension, unstable KT fibers, an extensive prometaphase delay, and severe chromosome misalignment. Moreover, depletion of hSpindly induces a striking spindle rotation, which can be rescued by co-depletion of dynein. However, in contrast to Drosophila, hSpindly depletion does not abolish the removal of MAD2 and ZW10 from KTs. Collectively, our data reveal hSpindly-mediated dynein functions and highlight a critical role of KT dynein in spindle orientation.
3 Residential exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides and risk of childhood leukemia. Incidence of childhood leukemia in industrialized countries rose significantly during 1975-2004, and the reasons for the increase are not understood. We used carpet dust as an exposure indicator to examine the risk of childhood leukemia in relation to residential exposure to persistent organochlorine chemicals: six polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and the pesticides alpha- and gamma-chlordane, p,p'-DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), p,p'-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), methoxychlor, and pentachlorophenol. We conducted a population-based case-control study in 35 counties in northern and central California in 2001-2006. The study included 184 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases 0-7 years of age and 212 birth certificate controls matched to cases by birth date, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. We collected carpet dust samples from the room where the child spent the most time before diagnosis (similar date for controls) using a specialized vacuum. Detection of any PCB congener in the dust conferred a 2-fold increased risk of ALL [odds ratio (OR) = 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-3.17]. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of total PCBs, the highest quartile was associated with about a 3-fold risk (OR = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.41-5.48), and the positive trend was significant (p = 0.017). Significant positive trends in ALL risk were apparent with increasing concentrations of PCB congeners 118, 138, and 153. We observed no significant positive associations for chlordane, DDT, DDE, methoxychlor, or pentachlorophenol. The associations with PCBs were stronger among non-Hispanic whites than among Hispanics despite similar distributions of PCB levels among controls in each racial/ethnic group. Our findings suggest that PCBs, which are considered probable human carcinogens and cause perturbations of the immune system, may represent a previously unrecognized risk factor for childhood leukemia.
0 Preliminary evidence for the cross-cultural utility of the type D personality construct in the Ukraine. Type D personality is a risk indicator in cardiac patients. The validity and reliability of the Type D Scale (DS14) have been confirmed in Western Europe but not outside this context. We examined the structural, convergent, and divergent validity and the reliability of the DS14 in the Ukrainian setting. Healthy Ukrainian respondents (n = 250) completed the DS14, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory. A subsample (n = 57) completed the DS14 again after 4 weeks. The prevalence of Type D personality was 22.4%. The two-factor structure and the validity of the DS14 were confirmed. The DS14 subscales were internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86/0.71; mean inter-item correlation = 0.48/0.27) and stable over a 4-week period (r = 0.85/0.63). Type D individuals had significantly higher mean scores on anxiety (p < 0.001), depressive symptoms (p < 0.001), and negative affect (p < 0.001), and lower scores on positive affect (p < 0.001) compared to non-Type D individuals. Preliminary evidence suggests that the Ukrainian DS14 is a valid and reliable measure. Future studies are warranted to test the utility of the scale in cardiac patients in the Ukraine, including whether Type D also predicts adverse health outcomes beyond the boundaries of Western Europe.
0 Intermediates: ubiquitous species on folding energy landscapes? Although intermediates have long been recognised as fascinating species that form during the folding of large proteins, the role that intermediates play in the folding of small, single-domain proteins has been widely debated. Recent discoveries using new, sensitive methods of detection and studies combining simulation and experiment have now converged on a common vision for folding, involving intermediates as ubiquitous stepping stones en route to the native state. The results suggest that the folding energy landscapes of even the smallest proteins possess significant ruggedness in which intermediates stabilized by both native and non-native interactions are common features.
3 Development of an automated speech recognition interface for Personal Emergency Response Systems. Demands on long-term-care facilities are predicted to increase at an unprecedented rate as the baby boomer generation reaches retirement age. Aging-in-place (i.e. aging at home) is the desire of most seniors and is also a good option to reduce the burden on an over-stretched long-term-care system. Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERSs) help enable older adults to age-in-place by providing them with immediate access to emergency assistance. Traditionally they operate with push-button activators that connect the occupant via speaker-phone to a live emergency call-centre operator. If occupants do not wear the push button or cannot access the button, then the system is useless in the event of a fall or emergency. Additionally, a false alarm or failure to check-in at a regular interval will trigger a connection to a live operator, which can be unwanted and intrusive to the occupant. This paper describes the development and testing of an automated, hands-free, dialogue-based PERS prototype. The prototype system was built using a ceiling mounted microphone array, an open-source automatic speech recognition engine, and a 'yes' and 'no' response dialog modelled after an existing call-centre protocol. Testing compared a single microphone versus a microphone array with nine adults in both noisy and quiet conditions. Dialogue testing was completed with four adults. The microphone array demonstrated improvement over the single microphone. In all cases, dialog testing resulted in the system reaching the correct decision about the kind of assistance the user was requesting. Further testing is required with elderly voices and under different noise conditions to ensure the appropriateness of the technology. Future developments include integration of the system with an emergency detection method as well as communication enhancement using features such as barge-in capability. The use of an automated dialog-based PERS has the potential to provide users with more autonomy in decisions regarding their own health and more privacy in their own home.
1 Screening and brief interventions for hazardous alcohol use in accident and emergency departments: a randomised controlled trial protocol. There is a wealth of evidence regarding the detrimental impact of excessive alcohol consumption on the physical, psychological and social health of the population. There also exists a substantial evidence base for the efficacy of brief interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption across a range of healthcare settings. Primary research conducted in emergency departments has reinforced the current evidence regarding the potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Within this body of evidence there is marked variation in the intensity of brief intervention delivered, from very minimal interventions to more intensive behavioural or lifestyle counselling approaches. Further the majority of primary research has been conducted in single centre and there is little evidence of the wider issues of generalisability and implementation of brief interventions across emergency departments. The study design is a prospective pragmatic factorial cluster randomised controlled trial. Individual Emergency Departments (ED) (n = 9) are randomised with equal probability to a combination of screening tool (M-SASQ vs FAST vs SIPS-PAT) and an intervention (Minimal intervention vs Brief advice vs Brief lifestyle counselling). The primary hypothesis is that brief lifestyle counselling delivered by an Alcohol Health Worker (AHW) is more effective than Brief Advice or a minimal intervention delivered by ED staff. Secondary hypotheses address whether short screening instruments are more acceptable and as efficient as longer screening instruments and the cost-effectiveness of screening and brief interventions in ED. Individual participants will be followed up at 6 and 12 months after consent. The primary outcome measure is performance using a gold-standard screening test (AUDIT). Secondary outcomes include; quantity and frequency of alcohol consumed, alcohol-related problems, motivation to change, health related quality of life and service utilisation. This paper presents a protocol for a large multi-centre pragmatic factorial cluster randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening and brief interventions for hazardous alcohol users attending emergency departments.

1 Trichomonas vaginalis infection and associated risk factors in a socially-marginalized female population in coastal Peru. The epidemiology of Trichomonas vaginalis infection among sexually active socially-marginalized women in three urban, coastal Peruvian cities was examined in order to quantify the prevalence of trichomonas infection and identify associated risk factors. We conducted a cross-sectional, venue-based study of women from socially-marginalized populations in three coastal Peruvian cities. Among the 319 women enrolled, the overall prevalence of trichomonal infection was 9.1% (95% CI, 5.9%-12.3%). The mean age was 26.3 years, and 35.5% reported having had unprotected intercourse with nonprimary partners and 19.8% reported two or more sex partners in the last three months. Trichomonal infection was associated with increased number of sex partners (PR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.6) and unprotected sex with nonprimary partner in the last three months (PR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.9). A moderately high prevalence of trichomonal infection was found among women in our study. Trichomonal infection was associated with unprotected sex and multiple sex partners. Efforts to control the continued spread of trichomonal infection are warranted.
2 Protease-dependent versus -independent cancer cell invasion programs: three-dimensional amoeboid movement revisited. Tissue invasion during metastasis requires cancer cells to negotiate a stromal environment dominated by cross-linked networks of type I collagen. Although cancer cells are known to use proteinases to sever collagen networks and thus ease their passage through these barriers, migration across extracellular matrices has also been reported to occur by protease-independent mechanisms, whereby cells squeeze through collagen-lined pores by adopting an ameboid phenotype. We investigate these alternate models of motility here and demonstrate that cancer cells have an absolute requirement for the membrane-anchored metalloproteinase MT1-MMP for invasion, and that protease-independent mechanisms of cell migration are only plausible when the collagen network is devoid of the covalent cross-links that characterize normal tissues.
1 Hsp70 chaperones and type I PRMTs are sequestered at intranuclear inclusions caused by polyalanine expansions in PABPN1. Genomic instability at loci with tandem arrays of simple repeats is the cause for many neurological, neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. When located in coding regions, disease-associated expansions of trinucleotide repeats are translated into homopolymeric amino acid stretches of glutamine or alanine. Polyalanine expansions in the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene causes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). To gain novel insight into the molecular pathophysiology of OPMD, we studied the interaction of cellular proteins with normal and expanded PABPN1. Pull-down assays show that heat shock proteins including Hsp70, and type I arginine methyl transferases (PRMT1 and PRMT3) associate preferentially with expanded PABPN1. Immunofluorescence microscopy further reveals accumulation of these proteins at intranuclear inclusions in muscle from OPMD patients. Recombinant PABPN1 with expanded polyalanine stretches binds Hsp70 with higher affinity, and data from molecular simulations suggest that expansions of the PABPN1 polyalanine tract result in transition from a disordered, flexible conformation to a stable helical secondary structure. Taken together, our results suggest that the pathological mutation in the PABPN1 gene alters the protein conformation and induces a preferential interaction with type I PRMTs and Hsp70 chaperones. This in turn causes sequestration in intranuclear inclusions, possibly leading to a progressive cellular defect in arginine methylation and chaperone activity.
3 Consumption of a high-fat diet in adulthood ameliorates the effects of neonatal parathion exposure on acetylcholine systems in rat brain regions. Developmental exposure to a wide variety of developmental neurotoxicants, including organophosphate pesticides, evokes late-emerging and persistent abnormalities in acetylcholine (ACh) systems. We are seeking interventions that can ameliorate or reverse the effects later in life. We administered parathion to neonatal rats and then evaluated whether a high-fat diet begun in adulthood could reverse the effects on ACh systems. Neonatal rats received parathion on postnatal days 1-4 at 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg/day, straddling the cholinesterase inhibition threshold. In adulthood, half the animals were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. We assessed three indices of ACh synaptic function: nicotinic ACh receptor binding, choline acetyltransferase activity, and hemicholinium-3 binding. Determinations were performed in brain regions comprising all the major ACh projections and cell bodies. Neonatal parathion exposure evoked widespread abnormalities in ACh synaptic markers, encompassing effects in brain regions possessing ACh projections and ACh cell bodies. In general, males were affected more than females. Of 17 regional ACh marker abnormalities (10 male, 7 female), 15 were reversed by the high-fat diet. A high-fat diet reverses neurodevelopmental effects of neonatal parathion exposure on ACh systems. This points to the potential for nonpharmacologic interventions to offset the effects of developmental neurotoxicants. Further, cryptic neurodevelopmental deficits evoked by environmental exposures may thus engender a later preference for a high-fat diet to maintain normal ACh function, ultimately contributing to obesity.
1 Accelerator mass spectrometry targets of submilligram carbonaceous samples using the high-throughput Zn reduction method. The high-throughput Zn reduction method was developed and optimized for various biological/biomedical accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) applications of mg of C size samples. However, high levels of background carbon from the high-throughput Zn reduction method were not suitable for sub-mg of C size samples in environmental, geochronology, and biological/biomedical AMS applications. This study investigated the effect of background carbon mass (mc) and background 14C level (Fc) from the high-throughput Zn reduction method. Background mc was 0.011 mg of C and background Fc was 1.5445. Background subtraction, two-component mixing, and expanded formulas were used for background correction. All three formulas accurately corrected for backgrounds to 0.025 mg of C in the aerosol standard (NIST SRM 1648a). Only the background subtraction and the two-component mixing formulas accurately corrected for backgrounds to 0.1 mg of C in the IAEA-C6 and -C7 standards. After the background corrections, our high-throughput Zn reduction method was suitable for biological (diet)/biomedical (drug) and environmental (fine particulate matter) applications of sub-mg of C samples (> or = 0.1 mg of C) in keeping with a balance between throughput (270 samples/day/analyst) and sensitivity/accuracy/precision of AMS measurement. The development of a high-throughput method for examination of > or = 0.1 mg of C size samples opens up a range of applications for 14C AMS studies. While other methods do exist for > or = 0.1 mg of C size samples, the low throughput has made them cost prohibitive for many applications.
3 Bilobalide modulates serotonin-controlled behaviors in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Dysfunctions in the serotonergic system have been implicated in several neurological disorders such as depression. Elderly individuals who have been diagnosed with clinical depression show elevated cases of neurodegenerative diseases. This has led to suggestions that modulating the serotonin (5-HT) system could provide an alternative method to current therapies for alleviating these pathologies. The neuroprotective effects of bilobalide in vitro have been documented. We aim to determine whether bilobalide affects the 5-HT system in the nematode C. elegans. The wild type worms, as well as well-characterized 5-HT mutants, were fed with bilobalide in a range of concentrations, and several 5-HT controlled behaviors were tested. We observed that bilobalide significantly inhibited 5-HT-controlled egg-laying behavior in a dose-dependent manner, which was blocked in the 5-HT receptor mutants (ser-4, mod-1), but not in the 5-HT transporter (mod-5) or synthesis (tph-1) mutants. Bilobalide also potentiated a 5-HT-controlled, experience-dependent locomotory behavior, termed the enhanced slowing response in the wild type animals. However, this effect was fully blocked in 5-HT receptor mod-1 and dopamine defective cat-2 mutants, but only partially blocked in ser-4 mutants. We also demonstrated that acetylcholine transmission was inhibited in a transgenic C. elegans strain that constitutively expresses Abeta, and bilobalide did not significantly affect this inhibition. These results suggest that bilobalide may modulate specific 5-HT receptor subtypes, which involves interplay with dopamine transmission. Additional studies for the function of bilobalide in neurotransmitter systems could aid in our understanding of its neuroprotective properties.
1 Production, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of an exosite-containing fragment of human von Willebrand factor-cleaving proteinase ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 is a reprolysin-type metalloproteinase belonging to the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif) family. It specifically cleaves plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) and regulates platelet adhesion and aggregation. ADAMTS13 is a multi-domain enzyme. In addition to the N-terminal metalloproteinase domain, the ancillary domains, including a disintegrin-like domain, a thrombospondin-1 type 1 repeat, a Cys-rich domain and a spacer domain, are required for VWF recognition and cleavage. In the present study, a fragment of the ADAMTS13 ancillary domains (ADAMTS13-DTCS; residues 287-685) was expressed using CHO Lec cells, purified and crystallized. Diffraction data sets were collected using the SPring-8 beamline. Two ADAMTS13-DTCS crystals with distinct unit-cell parameters generated data sets to 2.6 and 2.8 A resolution, respectively.
0 Novel mutations in TLR genes cause hyporesponsiveness to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection. Toll like receptors (TLR) play the central role in the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Mutations in the TLR1, TLR2 and TLR4 genes may change the ability to recognize PAMPs and cause altered responsiveness to the bacterial pathogens. The study presents association between TLR gene mutations and increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection. Novel mutations in TLR genes (TLR1- Ser150Gly and Val220Met; TLR2 - Phe670Leu) were statistically correlated with the hindrance in recognition of MAP legends. This correlation was confirmed subsequently by measuring the expression levels of cytokines (IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-gamma) in the mutant and wild type moDCs (mocyte derived dendritic cells) after challenge with MAP cell lysate or LPS. Further in silico analysis of the TLR1 and TLR4 ectodomains (ECD) revealed the polymorphic nature of the central ECD and irregularities in the central LRR (leucine rich repeat) motifs. The most critical positions that may alter the pathogen recognition ability of TLR were: the 9th amino acid position in LRR motif (TLR1-LRR10) and 4th residue downstream to LRR domain (exta-LRR region of TLR4). The study describes novel mutations in the TLRs and presents their association with the MAP infection.
0 Transcriptional analysis of in vitro expression patterns of Chlamydophila abortus polymorphic outer membrane proteins during the chlamydial developmental cycle. Chlamydophila abortus is the aetiological agent of ovine enzootic abortion. Sequencing, annotation and comparative analysis of the genome of C. abortus strain S26/3 has revealed variation in the loci encoding the polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmps). These Pmps resemble autotransporter proteins of the type V secretion system, suggesting an important role in chlamydial pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to characterise the transcriptional expression patterns of this family during the developmental cycle of C. abortus. McCoy cells were infected with C. abortus and analysed for pmp mRNA expression over a 72 h period. Few pmp transcripts were detected in the early stages of the developmental cycle. Peak expression occurred at 48 h post-infection (p.i.) other than for pmp5E, where it was observed at 24 h p.i. Overall, expression of pmps 5E, 18D and 10G were found to be 40 to 100-fold higher than the lowest expressing pmps (6H, 1 3G and 15G) at 24 h p.i., while pmps 18D and 17G were 14 to 16-fold higher than the lowest (11G, 14G and 15G) at 48 h. Levels of expression for all the other pmp genes were below one copy per genome at any time point. The expression of all the pmps reduced to near base-line levels by 60 h p.i. These results demonstrate that pmp expression in C. abortus is mid to late cycle, consistent with conversion of the reticulate body to the elementary body. The low level of pmp transcription may be indicative of heterogeneity in expression, suggesting a possible role for some of the Pmps in antigenic variation and chlamydial pathogenesis.
1 Molecular and functional characterization of polymorphisms in the secreted phospholipase A2 group X gene: relevance to coronary artery disease. Among secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s), human group X sPLA2 (hGX sPLA2) is emerging as a novel attractive therapeutic target due to its implication in inflammatory diseases. To elucidate whether hGX sPLA2 plays a causative role in coronary artery disease (CAD), we screened the human PLA2G10 gene to identify polymorphisms and possible associations with CAD end-points in a prospective study, AtheroGene. We identified eight polymorphisms, among which, one non-synonymous polymorphism R38C in the propeptide region of the sPLA2. The T-512C polymorphism located in the 5' untranslated region was associated with a decreased risk of recurrent cardiovascular events during follow-up. The functional analysis of the R38C polymorphism showed that it leads to a profound change in expression and activity of hGX sPLA2, although there was no detectable impact on CAD risk. Due to the potential role of hGX sPLA2 in inflammatory processes, these polymorphisms should be investigated in other inflammatory diseases.
0 ProteinArchitect: protein evolution above the sequence level. While many authors have discussed models and tools for studying protein evolution at the sequence level, molecular function is usually mediated by complex, higher order features such as independently folding domains and linear motifs that are based on or embedded in a particular arrangment of features such as secondary structure elements, transmembrane domains and regions with intrinsic disorder. This 'protein architecture' can, in its most simplistic representation, be visualized as domain organization cartoons that can be used to compare proteins in terms of the order of their mostly globular domains. Here, we describe a visual approach and a webserver for protein comparison that extend the domain organization cartoon concept. By developing an information-rich, compact visualization of different protein features above the sequence level, potentially related proteins can be compared at the level of propensities for secondary structure, transmembrane domains and intrinsic disorder, in addition to PFAM domains. A public Web server is available at www.proteinarchitect.net, while the code is provided at protarchitect.sourceforge.net. Due to recent advances in sequencing technologies we are now flooded with millions of predicted proteins that await comparative analysis. In many cases, mature tools focused on revealing hits with considerable global or local similarity to well-characterized proteins will not be able to lead us to testable hypotheses about a protein's function, or the function of a particular region. The visual comparison of different types of protein features with ProteinArchitect will be useful when assessing the relevance of similarity search hits, to discover subgroups in protein families and superfamilies, and to understand protein regions with conserved features outside globular regions. Therefore, this approach is likely to help researchers to develop testable hypotheses about a protein's function even if is somewhat distant from the more characterized proteins, by facilitating the discovery of features that are conserved above the sequence level for comparison and further experimental investigation.
1 Can health care databases be used to identify incident cases of osteonecrosis? Osteonecrosis (ON) is a rare disease associated with alcohol and glucocorticoid use. Identifying additional risk factors is difficult as the number of cases at any single center is small. We investigated whether data available in large health care databases can be used to identify incident ON cases. Using data from the Boston Veterans Affairs Healthcare system, we identified potential cases of ON. These records, including available radiographs and reports, were reviewed. Using published criteria, we evaluated whether the subjects had confirmed ON (radiographs/reports met criteria), incident ON (onset of symptoms within 6 months of first code), or prevalent ON (onset more than 6 months prior to first code or onset could not be determined). We tested different definitions for incident ON using information derived from administrative data. These were compared to the 'gold standard' (record review) and positive predictive values (PPVs) were derived. Since PPVs for incident cases were low, we found the number of incident cases expected for every 1,000 potential cases identified, using the definitions as an initial screening tool to reduce the number of medical records that required examination. We identified 87 potential cases. No case of jaw ON was identified. Only 15 (17%) incident cases of ON were identified. PPVs never exceed 50% for incident ON. However, if we used the definition '(at least 1 inpatient ON code) and (no prior codes for osteoarthritis)' as an initial screen, then for every 1,000 records, we would need to review only 150 to find 69 incident cases. Though the precise PPVs we found may not be generalizable to other databases, we believe that administrative data alone should not be used to identify incident cases of ON without confirming the diagnosis through a review of medical records. By applying the above definition, the number of records requiring review can be markedly reduced. This method can be used to find cases for valid case-control studies of risk factors for ON.
2 Preventing knee injuries in adolescent female football players - design of a cluster randomized controlled trial [NCT00894595]. Knee injuries in football are common regardless of age, gender or playing level, but adolescent females seem to have the highest risk. The consequences after severe knee injury, for example anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, are well-known, but less is known about knee injury prevention. We have designed a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of a warm-up program aimed at preventing acute knee injury in adolescent female football. In this cluster randomized trial 516 teams (309 clusters) in eight regional football districts in Sweden with female players aged 13-17 years were randomized into an intervention group (260 teams) or a control group (256 teams). The teams in the intervention group were instructed to do a structured warm-up program at two training sessions per week throughout the 2009 competitive season (April to October) and those in the control group were informed to train and play as usual. Sixty-eight sports physical therapists are assigned to the clubs to assist both groups in data collection and to examine the players' acute knee injuries during the study period. Three different forms are used in the trial: (1) baseline player data form collected at the start of the trial, (2) computer-based registration form collected every month, on which one of the coaches/team leaders documents individual player exposure, and (3) injury report form on which the study therapists report acute knee injuries resulting in time loss from training or match play. The primary outcome is the incidence of ACL injury and the secondary outcomes are the incidence of any acute knee injury (except contusion) and incidence of severe knee injury (defined as injury resulting in absence of more than 4 weeks). Outcome measures are assessed after the end of the 2009 season. Prevention of knee injury is beneficial for players, clubs, insurance companies, and society. If the warm-up program is proven to be effective in reducing the incidence of knee injury, it can have a major impact by reducing the future knee injury burden in female football as well as the negative long-term disabilities associated with knee injury.

1 Identification of a kinase profile that predicts chromosome damage induced by small molecule kinase inhibitors. Kinases are heavily pursued pharmaceutical targets because of their mechanistic role in many diseases. Small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) are a compound class that includes marketed drugs and compounds in various stages of drug development. While effective, many SMKIs have been associated with toxicity including chromosomal damage. Screening for kinase-mediated toxicity as early as possible is crucial, as is a better understanding of how off-target kinase inhibition may give rise to chromosomal damage. To that end, we employed a competitive binding assay and an analytical method to predict the toxicity of SMKIs. Specifically, we developed a model based on the binding affinity of SMKIs to a panel of kinases to predict whether a compound tests positive for chromosome damage. As training data, we used the binding affinity of 113 SMKIs against a representative subset of all kinases (290 kinases), yielding a 113x290 data matrix. Additionally, these 113 SMKIs were tested for genotoxicity in an in vitro micronucleus test (MNT). Among a variety of models from our analytical toolbox, we selected using cross-validation a combination of feature selection and pattern recognition techniques: Kolmogorov-Smirnov/T-test hybrid as a univariate filter, followed by Random Forests for feature selection and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for pattern recognition. Feature selection identified 21 kinases predictive of MNT. Using the corresponding binding affinities, the SVM could accurately predict MNT results with 85% accuracy (68% sensitivity, 91% specificity). This indicates that kinase inhibition profiles are predictive of SMKI genotoxicity. While in vitro testing is required for regulatory review, our analysis identified a fast and cost-efficient method for screening out compounds earlier in drug development. Equally important, by identifying a panel of kinases predictive of genotoxicity, we provide medicinal chemists a set of kinases to avoid when designing compounds, thereby providing a basis for rational drug design away from genotoxicity.
2 The feasibility and efficacy of a multidisciplinary intervention with aftercare meetings for fibromyalgia. The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility and long-term results of a 12-week multidisciplinary part-time daycare intervention with five aftercare meetings in fibromyalgia (FM) patients. One hundred and five patients diagnosed with FM started with a multidisciplinary intervention and were assessed for feasibility, functional status (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire [FIQ]), and quality of life (EuroQol-5D [EQ-5D]) until 9 months after completion. The program consisted of sociotherapy, physiotherapy, psychotherapy, and creative arts therapy. Drop-out rate was 4.8%. The attendance rate of 100 patients who completed the 12-week program and five aftercare meetings was high (97.4%), just like patient and therapist satisfaction (8.2 on a 10 points scale). After the 12-week program, statistically significant improvement was seen in both FIQ and EQ-5D. This improvement was maintained after 9 months of follow-up. On average, moderate improvements were observed. Our 12-week multidisciplinary part-time daycare intervention with five aftercare meetings for FM patients is feasible and it is indicated that it can lead to sustained improvement in functional status and quality of life.
3 National support to public health research: a survey of European ministries. Within SPHERE (Strengthening Public Health Research in Europe), a collaborative study funded by the European Commission, we have assessed the support for public health research at ministry level in European countries. We surveyed the health and science ministries in 25 EU countries and 3 EEA countries, using a broad definition of public-health research at population level. We made over 600 phone calls and emails to identify respondents and to gain answers. We gained formal replies from 42 out of 56 ministries (73% response) in 25 countries. There were 22 completed questionnaires (from 25 ministries), 6 short answers and 11 contacts declaring that their ministries were not responsible for public health research, while in 14 ministries (both ministries in three countries) no suitable ministry contact could be found. In most European countries, ministries of health, or their devolved agencies, were regarded as the leading organizations. Most ministries were able to specify thematic areas for public-health research (from three to thirty), and others ministries referred to policy documents, health plans or public-health plans to define research priorities. Ministries and their agencies led on decisions for financial support of public-health research, with less involvement of other external organisations compared with the process of identifying priorities. However, the actual funds available for public health were not easily identifiable. Most ministries relied on general academic means for dissemination of results of public-health research, while ministries get information on the use of public-health research usually through informal means. Ministries made suggestions for strengthening public-health research through initiatives of their own countries and of the European Union: as well as more resources, improving coordination was most frequently suggested. There is no common approach to support for public-health research across Europe, and significant gaps in organisation and funding. Health ministries and national agencies value exchange between researchers and policy-makers, civil society organizations, and academic and public authorities, and the application of public-health research results. There would be benefits from better processes of priority setting and improved coordination for research, at regional, national and European levels.
0 Numb regulates cell-cell adhesion and polarity in response to tyrosine kinase signalling. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which can be caused by aberrant tyrosine kinase signalling, marks epithelial tumour progression and metastasis, yet the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we report that Numb interacts with E-cadherin (E-cad) through its phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) and thereby regulates the localization of E-cad to the lateral domain of epithelial cell-cell junction. Moreover, Numb engages the polarity complex Par3-aPKC-Par6 by binding to Par3 in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Intriguingly, after Src activation or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) treatment, Numb decouples from E-cad and Par3 and associates preferably with aPKC-Par6. Binding of Numb to aPKC is necessary for sequestering the latter in the cytosol during HGF-induced EMT. Knockdown of Numb by small hairpin RNA caused a basolateral-to-apicolateral translocation of E-cad and beta-catenin accompanied by elevated actin polymerization, accumulation of Par3 and aPKC in the nucleus, an enhanced sensitivity to HGF-induced cell scattering, a decrease in cell-cell adhesion, and an increase in cell migration. Our work identifies Numb as an important regulator of epithelial polarity and cell-cell adhesion and a sensor of HGF signalling or Src activity during EMT.
1 The covariance between relatives conditional on genetic markers. The development of molecular genotyping techniques makes it possible to analyze quantitative traits on the basis of individual loci. With marker information, the classical theory of estimating the genetic covariance between relatives can be reformulated to improve the accuracy of estimation. In this study, an algorithm was derived for computing the conditional covariance between relatives given genetic markers. Procedures for calculating the conditional relationship coefficients for additive, dominance, additive by additive, additive by dominance, dominance by additive and dominance by dominance effects were developed. The relationship coefficients were computed based on conditional QTL allelic transmission probabilities, which were inferred from the marker allelic transmission probabilities. An example data set with pedigree and linked markers was used to demonstrate the methods developed. Although this study dealt with two QTLs coupled with linked markers, the same principle can be readily extended to the situation of multiple QTL. The treatment of missing marker information and unknown linkage phase between markers for calculating the covariance between relatives was discussed.
0 Experimental infection with a low virulence isolate of Neospora caninum at 70 days gestation in cattle did not result in foetopathy. The Nc-Spain 1H isolate of Neospora caninum, which was newly obtained from the brain of a congenitally asymptomatic infected calf, demonstrated a reduced in vitro tachyzoite yield and viability rate, as well as low virulence in mouse models. The objective of the present study was to determine the ability of this isolate to induce foetal death in a pregnant bovine model. For this purpose, 13 naïve pregnant heifers were divided into three groups and were experimentally challenged with either 10(7) tachyzoites of Nc-1 (group 1, n=5), Nc-Spain 1H (group 2, n=5) isolates or phosphate-buffered saline (group 3, n=3) intravenously at 70 days of gestation. After inoculation, pregnancy was monitored and dams were sacrificed when foetal death was detected. The remaining animals were slaughtered at 45 days post-infection. Maternal and foetal samples were collected for examination by histology and parasite DNA detection. Parasitaemia, specific anti- N. caninum IgG and interferon gamma responses were also studied. At 3-4 weeks after infection, foetal death was detected in 3 out of 5 Nc-1-infected dams. However, no evidence of foetal death was observed in either Nc-Spain 1H-infected or control groups during the period studied. The most severe histopathological lesions were observed in the placenta and foetal organs from Nc-1-infected cattle that exhibited foetal death. It was in these animals that N. caninum DNA was more frequently detected. Parasitaemia was observed in all Nc-1-infected dams and in only 3 out of 5 Nc-Spain 1H-infected animals. The magnitude of the immune response was significantly higher in the Nc-1-inoculated group than in the group inoculated with the Nc-Spain 1H isolate. These data reveal the reduced virulence of the Nc-Spain 1H isolate in cattle.
0 A specific pattern of splicing for the horse alphaS1-Casein mRNA and partial genomic characterization of the relevant locus. Mares' milk has a composition very different from that of cows' milk. It is much more similar to human milk, in particular in its casein fraction. This study reports on the sequence of a 994 bp amplified fragment corresponding to a horse alphaS1-Casein (alphaS1-Cn) cDNA and its comparison with its caprine, pig, rabbit and human counterparts. The alignment of these sequences revealed a specific pattern of splicing for this horse primary transcript. As in humans, exons 3', 6' and 13' are present whereas exons 5, 13 and 14 are absent in this equine mRNA sequence. BAC clones, screened from a horse BAC library, containing the alphaS1-Cn gene allowed the mapping of its locus by FISH on equine chromosome 3q22.2-q22.3 which is in agreement with the Zoo-FISH results. Genomic analysis of the alphaS1-Cn gene showed that the region from the second exon to the last exon is scattered within a nucleotide stretch nearly 15-kb in length which is quite similar in size to its ruminant and rabbit counterparts. The region between alphaS1- and beta-Cn genes, suspected to contain cis-acting elements involved in the expression of all clustered casein genes, is similar in size (ca 15-kb) to the caprine and mouse intergenic region.
0 X-linked cataract and Nance-Horan syndrome are allelic disorders. Nance-Horan syndrome (NHS) is an X-linked developmental disorder characterized by congenital cataract, dental anomalies, facial dysmorphism and, in some cases, mental retardation. Protein truncation mutations in a novel gene (NHS) have been identified in patients with this syndrome. We previously mapped X-linked congenital cataract (CXN) in one family to an interval on chromosome Xp22.13 which encompasses the NHS locus; however, no mutations were identified in the NHS gene. In this study, we show that NHS and X-linked cataract are allelic diseases. Two CXN families, which were negative for mutations in the NHS gene, were further analysed using array comparative genomic hybridization. CXN was found to be caused by novel copy number variations: a complex duplication-triplication re-arrangement and an intragenic deletion, predicted to result in altered transcriptional regulation of the NHS gene. Furthermore, we also describe the clinical and molecular analysis of seven families diagnosed with NHS, identifying four novel protein truncation mutations and a novel large deletion encompassing the majority of the NHS gene, all leading to no functional protein. We therefore show that different mechanisms, aberrant transcription of the NHS gene or no functional NHS protein, lead to different diseases. Our data highlight the importance of copy number variation and non-recurrent re-arrangements leading to different severity of disease and describe the potential mechanisms involved.
3 Single domain antibodies: promising experimental and therapeutic tools in infection and immunity. Antibodies are important tools for experimental research and medical applications. Most antibodies are composed of two heavy and two light chains. Both chains contribute to the antigen-binding site which is usually flat or concave. In addition to these conventional antibodies, llamas, other camelids, and sharks also produce antibodies composed only of heavy chains. The antigen-binding site of these unusual heavy chain antibodies (hcAbs) is formed only by a single domain, designated VHH in camelid hcAbs and VNAR in shark hcAbs. VHH and VNAR are easily produced as recombinant proteins, designated single domain antibodies (sdAbs) or nanobodies. The CDR3 region of these sdAbs possesses the extraordinary capacity to form long fingerlike extensions that can extend into cavities on antigens, e.g., the active site crevice of enzymes. Other advantageous features of nanobodies include their small size, high solubility, thermal stability, refolding capacity, and good tissue penetration in vivo. Here we review the results of several recent proof-of-principle studies that open the exciting perspective of using sdAbs for modulating immune functions and for targeting toxins and microbes.
3 Feasibility of onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment in endemic foci in Africa: first evidence from studies in Mali and Senegal. Mass treatment with ivermectin is a proven strategy for controlling onchocerciasis as a public health problem, but it is not known if it can also interrupt transmission and eliminate the parasite in endemic foci in Africa where vectors are highly efficient. A longitudinal study was undertaken in three hyperendemic foci in Mali and Senegal with 15 to 17 years of annual or six-monthly ivermectin treatment in order to assess residual levels of infection and transmission and test whether ivermectin treatment could be safely stopped in the study areas. Skin snip surveys were undertaken in 126 villages, and 17,801 people were examined. The prevalence of microfilaridermia was <1% in all three foci. A total of 157,500 blackflies were collected and analyzed for the presence of Onchocerca volvulus larvae using a specific DNA probe, and vector infectivity rates were all below 0.5 infective flies per 1,000 flies. Except for a subsection of one focus, all infection and transmission indicators were below postulated thresholds for elimination. Treatment was therefore stopped in test areas of 5 to 8 villages in each focus. Evaluations 16 to 22 months after the last treatment in the test areas involved examination of 2,283 people using the skin snip method and a DEC patch test, and analysis of 123,000 black flies. No infected persons and no infected blackflies were detected in the test areas, and vector infectivity rates in other catching points were <0.2 infective flies per 1,000. This study has provided the first empirical evidence that elimination of onchocerciasis with ivermectin treatment is feasible in some endemic foci in Africa. Although further studies are needed to determine to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to other endemic areas in Africa, the principle of elimination has been established. The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control has adopted an additional objective to assess progress towards elimination endpoints in all onchocerciasis control projects and to guide countries on cessation of treatment where feasible.
3 The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate healthcare interventions: explanation and elaboration. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential to summarise evidence relating to efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions accurately and reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users. Since the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement-a reporting guideline published in 1999-there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realising these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this explanation and elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA statement, this document, and the associated website (www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
1 Influence of dopaminergically mediated reward on somatosensory decision-making. Reward-related dopaminergic influences on learning and overt behaviour are well established, but any influence on sensory decision-making is largely unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants judged electric somatosensory stimuli on one hand or other, before being rewarded for correct performance at trial end via a visual signal, at one of four anticipated financial levels. Prior to the procedure, participants received either placebo (saline), a dopamine agonist (levodopa), or an antagonist (haloperidol). higher anticipated reward improved tactile decisions. Visually signalled reward reactivated primary somatosensory cortex for the judged hand, more strongly for higher reward. After receiving a higher reward on one trial, somatosensory activations and decisions were enhanced on the next trial. These behavioural and neural effects were all enhanced by levodopa and attenuated by haloperidol, indicating dopaminergic dependency. Dopaminergic reward-related influences extend even to early somatosensory cortex and sensory decision-making.
1 Hippocampal volume reduction in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. Children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a genetic disorder characterized by diminished drive to breathe during sleep and impaired CO(2) sensitivity, show brain structural and functional changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, with impaired responses in specific hippocampal regions, suggesting localized injury.We assessed total volume and regional variation in hippocampal surface morphology to identify areas affected in the syndrome. We studied 18 CCHS (mean age+/-std: 15.1+/-2.2 years; 8 female) and 32 healthy control (age 15.2+/-2.4 years; 14 female) children, and traced hippocampi on 1 mm(3) resolution T1-weighted scans, collected with a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner. Regional hippocampal volume variations, adjusted for cranial volume, were compared between groups based on t-tests of surface distances to the structure midline, with correction for multiple comparisons. Significant tissue losses emerged in CCHS patients on the left side, with a trend for loss on the right; however, most areas affected on the left also showed equivalent right-sided volume reductions. Reduced regional volumes appeared in the left rostral hippocampus, bilateral areas in mid and mid-to-caudal regions, and a dorsal-caudal region, adjacent to the fimbria.The volume losses may result from hypoxic exposure following hypoventilation during sleep-disordered breathing, or from developmental or vascular consequences of genetic mutations in the syndrome. The sites of change overlap regions of abnormal functional responses to respiratory and autonomic challenges. Affected hippocampal areas have roles associated with memory, mood, and indirectly, autonomic regulation; impairments in these behavioral and physiological functions appear in CCHS.
1 Transcriptomes and pathways associated with infectivity, survival and immunogenicity in Brugia malayi L3. Filarial nematode parasites cause serious diseases such as elephantiasis and river blindness in humans, and heartworm infections in dogs. Third stage filarial larvae (L3) are a critical stage in the life cycle of filarial parasites, because this is the stage that is transmitted by arthropod vectors to initiate infections in mammals. Improved understanding of molecular mechanisms associated with this transition may provide important leads for development of new therapies and vaccines to prevent filarial infections. This study explores changes in gene expression associated with the transition of Brugia malayi third stage larvae (BmL3) from mosquitoes into mammalian hosts and how these changes are affected by radiation. Radiation effects are especially interesting because irradiated L3 induce partial immunity to filarial infections. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of such vaccines are unkown. Expression profiles were obtained using a new filarial microarray with 18, 104 64-mer elements. 771 genes were identified as differentially expressed in two-way comparative analyses of the three L3 types. 353 genes were up-regulated in mosquito L3 (L3i) relative to cultured L3 (L3c). These genes are important for establishment of filarial infections in mammalian hosts. Other genes were up-regulated in L3c relative to L3i (234) or irradiated L3 (L3ir) (22). These culture-induced transcripts include key molecules required for growth and development. 165 genes were up-regulated in L3ir relative to L3c; these genes encode highly immunogenic proteins and proteins involved in radiation repair. L3ir and L3i have similar transcription profiles for genes that encode highly immunogenic proteins, antioxidants and cuticle components. Changes in gene expression that normally occur during culture under conditions that support L3 development and molting are prevented or delayed by radiation. This may explain the enhanced immunogenicity of L3ir. Gene Ontology and KEGG analyses revealed altered pathways between L3 types. Energy and "immune pathways" are up-regulated and may be needed for L3i invasion and survival, while growth and development are priorities for L3c. This study has improved our understanding of molecules involved in parasite invasion and immune evasion, potential targets of protective immunity, and molecules required for parasite growth and development.
0 Heterochromatin protein 1 is recruited to various types of DNA damage. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family members are chromatin-associated proteins involved in transcription, replication, and chromatin organization. We show that HP1 isoforms HP1-alpha, HP1-beta, and HP1-gamma are recruited to ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage and double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells. This response to DNA damage requires the chromo shadow domain of HP1 and is independent of H3K9 trimethylation and proteins that detect UV damage and DSBs. Loss of HP1 results in high sensitivity to UV light and ionizing radiation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that HP1 proteins are essential components of DNA damage response (DDR) systems. Analysis of single and double HP1 mutants in nematodes suggests that HP1 homologues have both unique and overlapping functions in the DDR. Our results show that HP1 proteins are important for DNA repair and may function to reorganize chromatin in response to damage.
1 Functional and anatomical outcomes after primary lens-sparing pars plana vitrectomy for Stage 4 retinopathy of prematurity. While lens-sacrificing vitrectomy is the standard approach to manage Stage 5 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), scleral buckling has been used to manage some cases of Stage 4. Lens-sparing vitrectomy was popularized by Maguire and Trese in selected cases of Stage 4 disease. To assess the functional and visual outcomes after primary lens-sparing pars plana vitrectomy for Stage 4 ROP. In a retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series, the records of 39 eyes of 31 patients presenting with Stage 4 retinal detachment secondary to ROP who underwent primary two or three-port lens-sparing vitrectomy from January 2000 to October 2006 were evaluated. The outcomes studied at the final follow-up visit were the retinal status, lens and medial clarity and visual acuity . Favorable anatomical outcome was defined as the retinal reattachment of the posterior pole at two months after the surgery; and favorable functional outcome was defined as a central, steady and maintained fixation, with the child following light. At mean follow-up of 15 months, 74% of the eyes had a favorable anatomical outcome with single procedure. The visual status was favorable in 63% . The lens remained clear in all the eyes at the last follow-up, and the media clarity was maintained in 87%. Intraoperative complications included vitreous hemorrhage, pre-retinal hemorrhage and retinal break formation. Lens-sparing vitrectomy helps to achieve a favorable anatomical and functional outcome in selected cases of Stage 4 ROP.
3 Formation of protocell-like vesicles in a thermal diffusion column. Many of the properties of bilayer membranes composed of simple single-chain amphiphiles seem to be well-suited for a potential role as primitive cell membranes. However, the spontaneous formation of membranes from such amphiphiles is a concentration-dependent process in which a significant critical aggregate concentration (cac) must be reached. Since most scenarios for the prebiotic synthesis of fatty acids and related amphiphiles would result in dilute solutions well below the cac, the identification of mechanisms that would lead to increased local amphiphile concentrations is an important aspect of defining reasonable conditions for the origin of cellular life. Narrow, vertically oriented channels within the mineral precipitates of hydrothermal vent towers have previously been proposed to act as natural Clusius-Dickel thermal diffusion columns, in which a strong transverse thermal gradient concentrates dilute molecules through the coupling of thermophoresis and convection. Here we experimentally demonstrate that a microcapillary acting as a thermal diffusion column can concentrate a solution of oleic acid. Upon concentration, self-assembly of large vesicles occurs in regions where the cac is exceeded. We detected vesicle formation by fluorescence microscopy of encapsulated dye cargoes, which simultaneously concentrated in our channels. Our findings suggest a novel means by which simple physical processes could have led to the spontaneous formation of cell-like structures from a dilute prebiotic reservoir.
1 Specific cytogenetic labeling of bovine spermatozoa bearing X or Y chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). X and Y specific probes were identified in order to apply the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique to bovine spermatozoa. For Y chromosome detection, the BRY4a repetitive probe, covering three quarters of the chromosome, was used. For X chromosome detection, a goat Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) specific to the X chromosome of bovine and goats and giving a strong FISH signal was used. Each probe labeled roughly 45% of sperm cells. The hybridization method will be useful for evaluating the ratio of X- and Y- bearing spermatozoa in a sperm sample and consequently can be used to evaluate the efficiency of sperm sorting by different techniques such as flow cytometry.
3 Wnt signaling arrests effector T cell differentiation and generates CD8+ memory stem cells. Self-renewing cell populations such as hematopoietic stem cells and memory B and T lymphocytes might be regulated by shared signaling pathways. The Wnt-beta-catenin pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that promotes hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and multipotency by limiting stem cell proliferation and differentiation, but its role in the generation and maintenance of memory T cells is unknown. We found that induction of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling by inhibitors of glycogen sythase kinase-3beta or the Wnt protein family member Wnt3a arrested CD8(+) T cell development into effector cells. By blocking T cell differentiation, Wnt signaling promoted the generation of CD44(low)CD62L(high)Sca-1(high)CD122(high)Bcl-2(high) self-renewing multipotent CD8(+) memory stem cells with proliferative and antitumor capacities exceeding those of central and effector memory T cell subsets. These findings reveal a key role for Wnt signaling in the maintenance of 'stemness' in mature memory CD8(+) T cells and have major implications for the design of new vaccination strategies and adoptive immunotherapies.
3 RASMOT-3D PRO: a 3D motif search webserver. Detection of structural motif of residues in protein structures allows identification of structural or functional similarity between proteins. In the field of protein engineering, structural motif identification is essential to select protein scaffolds on which a motif of residues can be transferred to design a new protein with a given function. We describe here the RASMOT-3D PRO webserver (http://biodev.extra.cea.fr/rasmot3d/) that performs a systematic search in 3D structures of protein for a set of residues exhibiting a particular topology. Comparison is based on Calpha and Cbeta atoms in two steps: inter-atomic distances and RMSD. RASMOT-3D PRO takes in input a PDB file containing the 3D coordinates of the searched motif and provides an interactive list of identified protein structures exhibiting residues of similar topology as the motif searched. Each solution can be graphically examined on the website. The topological search can be conducted in structures described in PDB files uploaded by the user or in those deposited in the PDB. This characteristic as well as the possibility to reject scaffolds sterically incompatible with the target, makes RASMOT-3D PRO a unique webtool in the field of protein engineering.
3 Comparative evaluation of four mosquitoes sampling methods in rice irrigation schemes of lower Moshi, northern Tanzania. Adult malaria vector sampling is the most important parameter for setting up an intervention and understanding disease dynamics in malaria endemic areas. The intervention will ideally be species-specific according to sampling output. It was the objective of this study to evaluate four sampling techniques, namely human landing catch, pit shelter, indoor resting collection and odour-baited entry trap. These four sampling methods were evaluated simultaneously for thirty days during October 2008, a season of low mosquitoes density and malaria transmission. These trapping methods were performed in one village for maximizing homogeneity in mosquito density. The cattle and man used in odour-baited entry trap were rotated between the chambers to avoid bias. A total of 3,074 mosquitoes were collected. Among these 1,780 (57.9%) were Anopheles arabiensis and 1,294 (42.1%) were Culex quinquefasciatus. Each trap sampled different number of mosquitoes, Indoor resting collection collected 335 (10.9%), Odour-baited entry trap-cow 1,404 (45.7%), Odour-baited entry trap-human 378 (12.3%), Pit shelter 562 (18.3%) and HLC 395 (12.8%). General linear model univariate analysis method was used, position of the trapping method had no effect on mosquito density catch (DF = 4, F = 35.596, P = 0.78). Days variation had no effect on the collected density too (DF = 29, F = 4.789, P = 0.09). The sampling techniques had significant impact on the caught mosquito densities (DF = 4, F = 34.636, P < 0.0001). The Wilcoxon pair-wise comparison between mosquitoes collected in human landing catch and pit shelter was significant (Z = -3.849, P < 0.0001), human landing catch versus Indoor resting collection was not significant (Z = -0.502, P = 0.615), human landing catch versus odour-baited entry trap-man was significant (Z = -2.687, P = 0.007), human landing catch versus odour-baited entry trap-cow was significant (Z = -3.127, P = 0.002). Odour-baited traps with different baits and pit shelter have shown high productivity in collecting higher densities of mosquitoes than human landing catch. These abilities are the possibilities of replacing the human landing catch practices for sampling malaria vectors in areas with An. arabiensis as malaria vectors. Further evaluations of these sampling methods need to be investigated is other areas with different species.
3 Hand-rolled cigarette smoking patterns compared with factory-made cigarette smoking in New Zealand men. Roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes have increased in popularity, yet their comparative potential toxicity is uncertain. This study compares smoking of RYO and factory-made (FM) cigarettes on smoking pattern and immediate potential toxicity. At a research clinic, 26 RYO and 22 FM volunteer male cigarette smokers, (addicted and overnight-tobacco-abstinent) each smoked 4 filter cigarettes, one half-hourly over 2 hours, either RYO or FM according to usual habit, using the CReSSMicro flowmeter. First cigarette smoked was their own brand. Subsequent cigarettes, all Holiday regular brand, were RYOs (0.5 g tobacco with filter), or FM with filter. Cravings on 100 mm visual analogue scale, and exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) were measured before and after each cigarette smoked. Smokers reported similar daily cigarette consumption (RYO 19.0, FM 17.4, p = 0.45), and similar time after waking to first cigarette. (RYO 6.1 minutes, FM 8.6 minutes, p = 0.113). First cigarette's RYO tobacco (0.45 g) weighed less than for FM (0.7 g, p < 0.001); less tobacco was burnt (0.36 g, FM 0.55 g, p < 0.001) but smoking patterns were no different. RYO smokers smoked subsequent cigarettes more intensively; inhaled 28% more smoke per cigarette (RYO 952 mL, FM 743 mL, p = 0.025); took 25% more puffs (RYO 16.9, FM 13.6, p = 0.035); puffed longer (RYO 28 seconds, FM 22 seconds, p = 0.012), taking similar puffs (RYO 57 mL, FM 59 mL). Over four cigarettes, RYOs boosted alveolar CO (RYO 13.8 ppm, FM 13.8 ppm), and reduced cravings (RYO 53%, FM 52%) no differently from FM cigarettes. In these smokers, RYO smoking was associated with increased smoke exposure per cigarette, and similar CO breath levels, and even with filters is apparently no less and possibly more dangerous than FM smoking. Specific package warnings should warn of RYO smoking's true risk. RYOs are currently taxed much less than FM cigarettes in most countries; similar harm merits similar excise per cigarette.
3 A pilot study of the immune response to whole inactivated avian influenza H7N1 virus vaccine in mice. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in domestic poultry bring humans into close contact with new influenza subtypes and represent a threat to human health. In 1999, an HPAI outbreak of H7N1 virus occurred in domestic poultry in Italy, and a wild-type virus isolate from this outbreak was chosen as a pandemic vaccine candidate. We conducted a pilot study to investigate the kinetics of the humoral immune response induced after immunisation with an egg grown whole inactivated H7N1 virus vaccine in BALB/c mice. Mice were vaccinated with one or two doses of H7N1 vaccine (15 microg total protein) to investigate the influenza specific antibody secreting cell (IS-ASC) and serum antibody responses. After the first dose of vaccine, only IgM IS-ASC were detected in the spleen and bone marrow, whereas IgG, IgA and IgM IS-ASC were found after the second dose. Low antibody titres were detected after the first immunisation, whilst the second dose of vaccine significantly boosted the HI (range 128-512), neutralising and IgG antibody titres. The IgG subclass response was dominated by IgG2a indicating a dominant Th1 response after the first vaccination, whereas a more mixed Th1/Th2 profile was observed after the second dose. This pilot study shows the value of using a number of immunological methods to evaluate the quality of the immune response to potential pandemic candidate vaccines.
3 Individual differences in the sensitivity to serotonergic drugs: a pharmacobehavioural approach using rats selected on the basis of their response to novelty. The mechanisms underlying individual differences in the response to serotonergic drugs are poorly understood. Rat studies may contribute to our knowledge of the neuronal substrates that underlie these individual differences. A pharmacobehavioural study was performed to assess individual differences in the sensitivity to serotonergic drugs in rats that were selected based on their response to a novel environment. Low responders (LR) and high responders (HR) to novelty rats were tested on the elevated T-maze following systemic injections of increasing doses of various serotonergic agents. The duration of avoidance of the open arms was scored for five trials. The duration of avoidance behaviour was larger in saline-treated LR rats compared to saline-treated HR rats. The 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT and the 5-HT2 agonists mCPP and DOI decreased the duration of avoidance behaviour in LR rats, but increased it in HR rats. The 5-HT3 agonist SR57227A and the 5-HT releaser/reuptake inhibitor d-fenfluramine increased the duration of avoidance behaviour in both types of rat. However, higher doses of SR57227A were required to alter avoidance behaviour in HR than in LR rats. The onset of the effects of SR57227A, d-fenfluramine and WAY100635 was faster in LR than in HR rats. The described effects were receptor specific. A model explaining the data is presented. These data demonstrate that LR and HR rats differ in their sensitivity to serotonergic drugs that act at 5-HT3, 5-HT2 and 5-HT1A receptors. The implications of these individual differences for individual-specific treatment of substance abuse are briefly discussed.
1 Epidemiology of invasive cutaneous melanoma. Data are presented on the current incidence of melanoma with recent and predicted future trends illustrating a likely continuing increase in incidence. Risk factors for developing melanoma are discussed, including current known melanoma susceptibility genes. Phenotypic markers of high-risk subjects include high counts of benign melanocytic naevi. Other risk factors considered include exposure to natural and artificial ultraviolet radiation, the effect of female sex hormones, socioeconomic status, occupation, exposure to pesticides and ingestion of therapeutic drugs including immunosuppressives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Aids to earlier diagnosis are considered, including public education, screening and use of equipment such as the dermatoscope. Finally, the current pattern of survival and mortality is described.
2 High-sensitive and rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection by IFN-gamma release assay among HIV-infected individuals in BCG-vaccinated area. An accurate test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is urgently needed in immunosuppressed populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic power of enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT)-based IFN-gamma release assay in detecting active and latent tuberculosis in HIV-infected population in bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated area. A total of 100 HIV-infected individuals including 32 active tuberculosis patients were recruited. An ELISPOT-based IFN-gamma release assay, T-SPOT.TB, was used to evaluate the M. tuberculosis ESAT-6 and CFP-10 specific IFN-gamma response. Tuberculin skin test (TST) was performed for all recruited subjects. The subjects were divided into group HIV+ATB (HIV-infected individuals with active tuberculosis, n = 32), group HIV+LTB (HIV-infected individuals with positive results of T-SPOT.TB assay, n = 46) and group HIV only (HIV-infected individuals with negative results of T-SPOT.TB assay and without evidence of tuberculosis infection, n = 22). In group HIV+ATB and HIV+LTB, T-SPOT.TB positive rate in subjects with TST <5 mm were 50% (16/32) and 41.3% (19/46), respectively. Individuals in group HIV+ATB and HIV+LTB with CD4+ T cells <500/microl, T-SPOT.TB showed a higher sensitivity than TST (64.5% vs. 22.6% and 62.2% vs. 29.7%, respectively, both P < 0.0001). In addition, the sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB assay in group HIV+ATB increased to >85% in patients with TB treatment for less than 1 month and CD4+ T cells > or = 200/microl, while for patients treated for more than 3 months and CD4+ T cells <200/microl, the sensitivity was decreased to only 33.3%. Furthermore, the results could be generated by T-SPOT.TB assay within 24 hours, which was more rapid than TST with 48-72 hours. ELISPOT-based IFN-gamma release assay is more sensitive and rapid for the diagnosis of TB infection in Chinese HIV-infected individuals with history of BCG vaccination, and could be an effective tool for guiding preventive treatment with isoniazid in latently infected people and for TB control in China.
3 Overall and cancer related mortality among patients with ocular inflammation treated with immunosuppressive drugs: retrospective cohort study. Whether immunosuppressive treatment adversely affects survival is unclear. To assess whether immunosuppressive drugs increase mortality. Retrospective cohort study evaluating overall and cancer mortality in relation to immunosuppressive drug exposure among patients with ocular inflammatory diseases. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data derived from medical records, and mortality results from United States National Death Index linkage. The cohort's mortality risk was compared with US vital statistics using standardised mortality ratios. Overall and cancer mortality in relation to use or non-use of immunosuppressive drugs within the cohort was studied with survival analysis. Five tertiary ocular inflammation clinics. Patients 7957 US residents with non-infectious ocular inflammation, 2340 of whom received immunosuppressive drugs during follow up. Exposures Use of antimetabolites, T cell inhibitors, alkylating agents, and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors. Overall mortality, cancer mortality. Over 66 802 person years (17 316 after exposure to immunosuppressive drugs), 936 patients died (1.4/100 person years), 230 (24.6%) from cancer. For patients unexposed to immunosuppressive treatment, risks of death overall (standardised mortality ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 1.11) and from cancer (1.10, 0.93 to 1.29) were similar to those of the US population. Patients who used azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, systemic corticosteroids, or dapsone had overall and cancer mortality similar to that of patients who never took immunosuppressive drugs. In patients who used cyclophosphamide, overall mortality was not increased and cancer mortality was non-significantly increased. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were associated with increased overall (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.99, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.98) and cancer mortality (adjusted HR 3.83, 1.13 to 13.01). Most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs do not seem to increase overall or cancer mortality. Our results suggesting that tumour necrosis factor inhibitors might increase mortality are less robust than the other findings; additional evidence is needed.
1 Isolation and identification of antimicrobial compound from Mentha longifolia L. leaves grown wild in Iraq. Mentha longifolia L. (Lamiaceae) leaves have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation by the indigenous people of Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In the present study, an antimicrobial compound was isolated and characterized, and its biological activity was assessed. The compound was isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oil using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. Antimicrobial activity of the compound was assessed using both disc diffusion and microdilution method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. A known compound was isolated from the essential oil of the plant and was identified as (-) menthol. The isolated compound was investigated for its antimicrobial activity against seven selected pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast Candida albicans. Menthol at different concentrations (1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20) was active against all tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa, and the highest inhibitory effect was observed against S. mutans (zone of inhibition: 25.3 mm) using the disc diffusion method. Minimal inhibitory concentration MIC values ranged from 15.6-125.0 microg/ml, and the most promising results were observed against S. aureus and S. mutans (MIC 15.6 microg/ml) while, S. faecalis, S. pyogenis and L. acidophilus ranked next (MIC 31.2 microg/ml). Furthermore, menthol achieved considerable antifungal activity against the yeast C. albicans (zone of inhibition range: 7.1-18.5 mm; MIC: 125.0). The isolation of an antimicrobial compound from M. longifolia leaves validates the use of this plant in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation.
1 Differential micro RNA expression in PBMC from multiple sclerosis patients. Differences in gene expression patterns have been documented not only in Multiple Sclerosis patients versus healthy controls but also in the relapse of the disease. Recently a new gene expression modulator has been identified: the microRNA or miRNA. The aim of this work is to analyze the possible role of miRNAs in multiple sclerosis, focusing on the relapse stage. We have analyzed the expression patterns of 364 miRNAs in PBMC obtained from multiple sclerosis patients in relapse status, in remission status and healthy controls. The expression patterns of the miRNAs with significantly different expression were validated in an independent set of samples. In order to determine the effect of the miRNAs, the expression of some predicted target genes of these were studied by qPCR. Gene interaction networks were constructed in order to obtain a co-expression and multivariate view of the experimental data. The data analysis and later validation reveal that two miRNAs (hsa-miR-18b and hsa-miR-599) may be relevant at the time of relapse and that another miRNA (hsa-miR-96) may be involved in remission. The genes targeted by hsa-miR-96 are involved in immunological pathways as Interleukin signaling and in other pathways as wnt signaling. This work highlights the importance of miRNA expression in the molecular mechanisms implicated in the disease. Moreover, the proposed involvement of these small molecules in multiple sclerosis opens up a new therapeutic approach to explore and highlight some candidate biomarker targets in MS.
2 Review of control strategies for robotic movement training after neurologic injury. There is increasing interest in using robotic devices to assist in movement training following neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy devices. Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, assistive, challenge-based, haptic simulation, and coaching. The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and EMG- based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training. In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control algorithms in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control strategies.
0 The wheat omega-gliadin genes: structure and EST analysis. A survey and analysis is made of all available omega-gliadin DNA sequences including omega-gliadin genes within a large genomic clone, previously reported gene sequences, and ESTs identified from the large wheat EST collection. A contiguous portion of the Gli-B3 locus is shown to contain two apparently active omega-gliadin genes, two pseudogenes, and four fragments of the 3' portion of omega-gliadin sequences. Comparison of omega-gliadin sequences allows a phylogenetic picture of their relationships and genomes of origin. Results show three groupings of omega-gliadin active gene sequences assigned to each of the three hexaploid wheat genomes, and a fourth group thus far consisting of pseudogenes assigned to the A-genome. Analysis of omega-gliadin ESTs allows reconstruction of two full-length model sequences encoding the AREL- and ARQL-type proteins from the Gli-A3 and Gli-D3 loci, respectively. There is no DNA evidence of multiple active genes from these two loci. In contrast, ESTs allow identification of at least three to four distinct active genes at the Gli-B3 locus of some cultivars. Additional results include more information on the position of cysteines in some omega-gliadin genes and discussion of problems in studying the omega-gliadin gene family.
3 Adult vaccination strategies for the control of pertussis in the United States: an economic evaluation including the dynamic population effects. Prior economic evaluations of adult and adolescent vaccination strategies against pertussis have reached disparate conclusions. Using static approaches only, previous studies failed to analytically include the indirect benefits derived from herd immunity as well as the impact of vaccination on the evolution of disease incidence over time. We assessed the impact of different pertussis vaccination strategies using a dynamic compartmental model able to consider pertussis transmission. We then combined the results with economic data to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of pertussis immunization strategies for adolescents and adults in the US. The analysis compares combinations of programs targeting adolescents, parents of newborns (i.e. cocoon strategy), or adults of various ages. In the absence of adolescent or adult vaccination, pertussis incidence among adults is predicted to more than double in 20 years. Implementing an adult program in addition to childhood and adolescent vaccination either based on 1) a cocoon strategy and a single booster dose or 2) a decennial routine vaccination would maintain a low level of pertussis incidence in the long run for all age groups (respectively 30 and 20 cases per 100,000 person years). These strategies would also result in significant reductions of pertussis costs (between -77% and -80% including additional vaccination costs). The cocoon strategy complemented by a single booster dose is the most cost-effective one, whereas the decennial adult vaccination is slightly more effective in the long run. By providing a high level of disease control, the implementation of an adult vaccination program against pertussis appears to be highly cost-effective and often cost-saving.
1 Functional imaging of stimulus convergence in amygdalar neurons during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Associative conditioning is a ubiquitous form of learning throughout the animal kingdom and fear conditioning is one of the most widely researched models for studying its neurobiological basis. Fear conditioning is also considered a model system for understanding phobias and anxiety disorders. A fundamental issue in fear conditioning regards the existence and location of neurons in the brain that receive convergent information about the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) during the acquisition of conditioned fear memory. Convergent activation of neurons is generally viewed as a key event for fear learning, yet there has been almost no direct evidence of this critical event in the mammalian brain. Here, we used Arc cellular compartmental analysis of temporal gene transcription by fluorescence in situ hybridization (catFISH) to identify neurons activated during single trial contextual fear conditioning in rats. To conform to temporal requirements of catFISH analysis we used a novel delayed contextual fear conditioning protocol which yields significant single- trial fear conditioning with temporal parameters amenable to catFISH analysis. Analysis yielded clear evidence that a population of BLA neurons receives convergent CS and US information at the time of the learning, that this only occurs when the CS-US arrangement is supportive of the learning, and that this process requires N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. In contrast, CS-US convergence was not observed in dorsal hippocampus. Based on the pattern of Arc activation seen in conditioning and control groups, we propose that a key requirement for CS-US convergence onto BLA neurons is the potentiation of US responding by prior exposure to a novel CS. Our results also support the view that contextual fear memories are encoded in the amygdala and that the role of dorsal hippocampus is to process and transmit contextual CS information.
3 Losartan counteracts the hyper-reactivity to angiotensin II and ROCK1 over-activation in aortas isolated from streptozotocin-injected diabetic rats. In streptozotocin-injected rats (STZ-rats), we previously demonstrated a role for angiotensin II (AT-II) in cardiac remodelling and insulin resistance partially counteracted by in vivo treatment with losartan, an AT-II receptor antagonist.We now aimed to investigate the effect of treating diabetic STZ-rats with losartan on diabetes vascular response to vasoconstrictors. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided in four groups, two of them were assigned to receive losartan in the drinking water (20 mg/kg/day) until the experiment ending (3 weeks afterward). After 1 week, two groups, one of which receiving losartan, were injected in the tail vein with citrate buffer (normoglycemic, N and normoglycemic, losartan-treated, NL). The remaining received a single injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg in citrate i.v.) thus becoming diabetic (D) and diabetic losartan-treated (DL). Plasma glycaemia and blood pressure were measured in all animals before the sacrifice (15 days after diabetes induction).In aortic strips isolated from N, NL, D and DL rats we evaluated i) the isometric concentration-dependent contractile response to phenylephrine (Phe) and to AT-II; ii) the RhoA-kinase (ROCK1) activity and expression by enzyme-immunoassay and Western blot respectively. The concentration-dependent contractile effect of Phe was similar in aortas from all groups, whereas at all concentrations tested, AT-II contraction efficacy was 2 and half and 1 and half times higher in D and DL respectively in comparison with N and NL. AT-II contracture was similarly reduced in all groups by AT-II receptor antagonists, irbesartan or irbesartan plus PD123319. HA-1077 (10 microM), an inhibitor of ROCK1 activity, reduced AT-II efficacy (Deltamg/mg tissue w.w.) by -3.5 +/- 1.0, -4.6 +/- 1.9, -22.1 +/- 2.2 and -11.4 +/- 1.3 in N, NL, D and DL respectively). ROCK1 activity and expression were higher in D than in N/NL and DL aortas. Aortas isolated from STZ-rats present hyper-contracture to AT-II mainly dependent on the up-regulation of ROCK1 expression/activity. In vivo losartan treatment partially corrects AT-II hyper-contracture, limiting the increase in ROCK1 expression/activity. These data offer a new molecular mechanism supporting the rationale for using losartan in the prevention of diabetic vascular complications.
3 Endosomal adaptor proteins APPL1 and APPL2 are novel activators of beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. Canonical Wnt signaling regulates many aspects of cellular physiology and tissue homeostasis during development and in adult organisms. In molecular terms, stimulation by Wnt ligands leads to the stabilization of beta-catenin, its translocation to the nucleus, and stimulation of TCF (T-cell factor)-dependent transcription of target genes. This process is controlled at various stages by a number of regulatory proteins, including transcriptional activators and repressors. Here we demonstrate that the endosomal proteins APPL1 and APPL2 are novel activators of beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. APPL proteins are multifunctional adaptors and effectors of the small GTPase Rab5, which localize to a subpopulation of early endosomes but are also capable of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Overexpression of APPL1 or APPL2 protein stimulates the activity of beta-catenin/TCF-dependent reporter construct, whereas silencing of APPL1 reduces it. Both APPL proteins interact directly with Reptin, a transcriptional repressor binding to beta-catenin and HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1), and this interaction was mapped to the pleckstrin homology domain of APPL1. Moreover, APPL proteins are present in an endogenous complex containing Reptin, beta-catenin, HDAC1, and HDAC2. Overexpression of either APPL protein relieves Reptin-dependent transcriptional repression and correlates with the reduced amounts of HDACs and beta-catenin associated with Reptin as well as with the lower levels of Reptin and HDAC1 on the promoters of beta-catenin target genes. We propose that APPL proteins exert their stimulatory effects on beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription by decreasing the activity of a Reptin-containing repressive complex.
3 Public perceptions, anxiety, and behaviour change in relation to the swine flu outbreak: cross sectional telephone survey. To assess whether perceptions of the swine flu outbreak predicted changes in behaviour among members of the public in England, Scotland, and Wales. Cross sectional telephone survey using random digit dialling. Interviews by telephone between 8 and 12 May. 997 adults aged 18 or more who had heard of swine flu and spoke English. Recommended change in behaviour (increases in handwashing and surface cleaning or plans made with a "flu friend") and avoidance behaviours (engaged in one or more of six behaviours such as avoiding large crowds or public transport). 37.8% of participants (n=377) reported performing any recommended behaviour change "over the past four days . . . because of swine flu." 4.9% (n=49) had carried out any avoidance behaviour. Controlling for personal details and anxiety, recommended changes were associated with perceptions that swine flu is severe, that the risk of catching it is high risk, that the outbreak will continue for a long time, that the authorities can be trusted, that good information has been provided, that people can control their risk of catching swine flu, and that specific behaviours are effective in reducing the risk. Being uncertain about the outbreak and believing that the outbreak had been exaggerated were associated with a lower likelihood of change. The strongest predictor of behaviour change was ethnicity, with participants from ethnic minority groups being more likely to make recommended changes (odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 5.3) and carry out avoidance behaviours (4.1, 2.0 to 8.4). The results support efforts to inform the public about specific actions that can reduce the risks from swine flu and to communicate about the government's plans and resources. Tackling the perception that the outbreak has been "over-hyped" may be difficult but worthwhile. Additional research is required into differing reactions to the outbreak among ethnic groups.
3 Revisiting the role of heterochromatin protein 1 in DNA repair. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a conserved factor critical for heterochromatin organization and gene silencing. It is recruited to chromatin by its direct interaction with H3K9me (methylated lysine 9 residue of histone H3), an epigenetic mark for silenced chromatin. Now, Luijsterburg et al. (Luijsterburg, M.S., C. Dinant, H. Lans, J. Stap, E. Wiernasz, S. Lagerwerf, D.O. Warmerdam, M. Lindh, M.C. Brink, J.W. Dobrucki, et al. 2009. J. Cell Biol. 185:577-586) reveal a new H3K9me-independent role for HP1 in the DNA damage response, which is distinct from the one recently reported by Ayoub et al. (Ayoub, N., A.D. Jeyasekharan, J.A. Bernal, and A.R. Venkitaraman. 2008. Nature. 453:682-686).
2 Clinical review: fever in intensive care unit patients. Fever is a common response to sepsis in critically ill patients. Fever occurs when either exogenous or endogenous pyrogens affect the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 in the pre-optic nucleus. Prostaglandin E2 slows the rate of firing of warm sensitive neurons and results in increased body temperature. The febrile response is well preserved across the animal kingdom, and experimental evidence suggests it may be a beneficial response to infection. Fever, however, is commonly treated in critically ill patients, usually with antipyretics, without good data to support such a practice. Fever induces the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs), a class of proteins critical for cellular survival during stress. HSPs act as molecular chaperones, and new data suggest they may also have an anti-inflammatory role. HSPs and the heat shock response appear to inhibit the activation of NF-kappabeta, thus decreasing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. The anti-inflammatory effects of HSPs, coupled with improved survival of animal models with fever and infection, call into question the routine practice of treating fever in critically ill patients.
1 Mapping of heterologous expressed sequence tags as an alternative to microarrays for study of defense responses in plants. Microarray technology helped to accumulate an immense pool of data on gene expression changes in response to different environmental factors. Yet, computer- generated gene profiling using expressed sequence tags (EST) represents a valuable alternative to microarrays, which allows efficient discovery of homologous sequences in evolutionarily different species and comparison of gene sets on the whole genome scale. In this study, we used publicly available EST database derived from different plant species infected with a variety of pathogens, to generate an expression profile of homologous genes involved in defense response of a model organism, Arabidopsis thaliana. EST-driven prediction identified 4,935 genes (16% of the total Arabidopsis genome) which, according to the origin of EST sets, were associated with defense responses in the reference genome. Profiles of defense-related genes, obtained by mapping of heterologous EST, represent putative Arabidopsis homologs of the corresponding species. Comparison of these profiles in pairs and locating common genes allowed estimating similarity between defense-related gene sets of different plant species. To experimentally support computer data, we arbitrarily selected a number of transcription factor genes (TF) detected by EST mapping. Their expression levels were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction during infection with yellow strain of Cucumber mosaic virus, a compatible virus systemically infecting Arabidopsis. We observed that 65% of the designated TF were upregulated in accordance with the EST-generated profile. We demonstrated that heterologous EST mapping may be efficiently used to reveal genes involved in host defense responses to pathogens. Upregulated genes identified in this study substantially overlap with those previously obtained by microarrays.
2 Hepatic arterioportal shunts: dynamic CT and MR features. With the increased temporal resolution available in dynamic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hepatic arterioportal shunts are now more frequently encountered than in the past. The condition occurs in various hepatic diseases in which portal or hepatic venous flow is compromised. The underlying mechanism and the degree of shunt affect its appearance at dynamic imaging. The dynamic CT and MRI findings have been summarized as early enhancement of peripheral portal veins, and wedge-shaped transient parenchymal enhancement during the hepatic arterial phase. Recognition of arterioportal shunt can suggest the presence of a previously unsuspected disorder and avoids false-positive diagnosis or overestimation of a hepatic disease. Familiarity with the pathophysiology of arterioportal shunt also allows investigation of the hepatic hemodynamic changes occurring in various hepatic diseases.
3 Advances in marine microbial symbionts in the china sea and related pharmaceutical metabolites. Marine animals and plants such as sponges, sea squirts, corals, worms and algae host diverse and abundant symbiotic microorganisms. Marine microbial symbionts are possible the true producers or take part in the biosynthesis of some bioactive marine natural products isolated from the marine organism hosts. Investigation of the pharmaceutical metabolites may reveal the biosynthesis mechanisms of related natural products and solve the current problem of supply limitation in marine drug development. This paper reviews the advances in diversity revelation, biological activity and related pharmaceutical metabolites, and functional genes of marine microbial symbionts from the China Sea.
2 Inhaled steroid/tobacco smoke particle interactions: a new light on steroid resistance. Inhaled steroid resistance is an obstacle to asthma control in asthmatic smokers. The reasons of this phenomenon are not yet entirely understood. Interaction of drug particles with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) could change the aerodynamic profile of the drug through the particle coagulation phenomenon. Aim of the present study was to examine whether steroid particles interact with smoke when delivered in the presence of ETS. Beclomethasone-hydrofluoralkane (BDP-HFA) pMDI particle profile was studied after a single actuation delivered in ambient air or in the presence of ETS in an experimental chamber using a light scattering Optical Particle Counter capable of measuring the concentrations of particle sized 0.3-1.0, 1.1-2.0, 2.1-3.0, 3.1-4.0, 4.1-5.0, and > 5.1 microm in diameter with a sampling time of one second. The number of drug particles delivered after a single actuation was measured as the difference between total particle number after drug delivery and background particle number. Two groups of experiments were carried out at different ambient background particle concentrations. Two-tail Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. When delivered in ambient air, over 90% of BDP-HFA particles were found in the 0.3-1.0 microm size class, while particles sized 1.1-2.0 microm and 2.1-3.0 represented less than 6.6% and 2.8% of total particles, respectively. However, when delivered in the presence of ETS, drug particle profile was modified, with an impressive decrease of 0.3-1.0 microm particles, the most represented particles resulting those sized 1.1-2.0 microm (over 66.6% of total particles), and 2.1-3.0 microm particles accounting up to 31% of total particles. Our data suggest that particle interaction between inhaled BDP-HFA pMDI and ETS takes place in the first few seconds after drug delivery, with a decrease in smaller particles and a concurrent increase of larger particles. The resulting changes in aerosol particle profile might modify regional drug deposition with potential detriment to drug efficacy, and represent a new element of steroid resistance in smokers. Although the present study does not provide any functional or clinical assessment, it might be useful to advise smokers and non smokers with obstructive lung disease such as asthma or COPD, to avoid to act inhaled drugs in the presence of ETS in order to obtain the best therapeutic effect.
0 Racial disparity in pathophysiologic pathways of preterm birth based on genetic variants. To study pathophysiologic pathways in spontaneous preterm birth and possibly the racial disparity associating with maternal and fetal genetic variations, using bioinformatics tools. A large scale candidate gene association study was performed on 1442 SNPs in 130 genes in a case (preterm birth < 36 weeks) control study (term birth > 37 weeks). Both maternal and fetal DNA from Caucasians (172 cases and 198 controls) and 279 African-Americans (82 cases and 197 controls) were used. A single locus association (genotypic) analysis followed by hierarchical clustering was performed, where clustering was based on p values for significant associations within each race. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software, known pathophysiologic pathways in both races were determined. From all SNPs entered into the analysis, the IPA mapped genes to specific disease functions. Gene variants in Caucasians were implicated in disease functions shared with other known disorders; specifically, dermatopathy, inflammation, and hematological disorders. This may reflect abnormal cervical ripening and decidual hemorrhage. In African-Americans inflammatory pathways were the most prevalent. In Caucasians, maternal gene variants showed the most prominent role in disease functions, whereas in African Americans it was fetal variants. The IPA software was used to generate molecular interaction maps that differed between races and also between maternal and fetal genetic variants. Differences at the genetic level revealed distinct disease functions and operational pathways in African Americans and Caucasians in spontaneous preterm birth. Differences in maternal and fetal contributions in pregnancy outcome are also different between African Americans and Caucasians. These results present a set of explicit testable hypotheses regarding genetic associations with preterm birth in African Americans and Caucasians.
3 Aging-associated dysfunction of Akt/protein kinase B: S-nitrosylation and acetaminophen intervention. Aged skeletal muscle is characterized by an increased incidence of metabolic and functional disorders, which if allowed to proceed unchecked can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The mechanism(s) underlying the development of these disorders in aging skeletal muscle are not well understood. Protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) is an important regulator of cellular metabolism and survival, but it is unclear if aged muscle exhibits alterations in Akt function. Here we report a novel dysfunction of Akt in aging muscle, which may relate to S-nitrosylation and can be prevented by acetaminophen intervention. Compared to 6- and 27-month rats, the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473 and Thr308) was higher in soleus muscles of very aged rats (33-months). Paradoxically, these increases in Akt phosphorylation were associated with diminished mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation, along with decreased levels of insulin receptor beta (IR-beta), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and phosphorylation of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) (Ser241). In vitro Akt kinase measurements and ex vivo muscle incubation experiments demonstrated age-related impairments of Akt kinase activity, which were associated with increases in Akt S-nitrosylation and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Impairments in Akt function occurred parallel to increases in myocyte apoptosis and decreases in myocyte size and the expression of myosin and actin. These age-related disorders were attenuated by treating aged (27-month) animals with acetaminophen (30 mg/kg body weight/day) for 6-months. These data demonstrate that Akt dysfunction and increased S-nitrosylation of Akt may contribute to age-associated disorders in skeletal muscle and that acetaminophen may be efficacious for the treatment of age-related muscle dysfunction.
2 Clinical review: extracorporeal blood purification in severe sepsis. Sepsis and septic shock are the leading causes of acute renal failure, multiple organ system dysfunction, and death in the intensive care unit. The pathogenesis of sepsis is complex and comprises a mosaic of interconnected pathways. Several attempts to improve patient outcomes by targeting specific components of this network have been unsuccessful. For these reasons, the ideal immunomodulating strategy would be one that restores immunologic stability rather than blindly inhibiting or stimulating one or another component of this complex network. Hence, the recent focus of immunomodulatory therapy in sepsis has shifted to nonspecific methods of influencing the entire inflammatory response without suppressing it. Here, we discuss the various modalities of extracorporeal blood purification, the existing evidence, and future prospects.
3 How to optimize tuberculosis case finding: explorations for Indonesia with a health system model. A mathematical model was designed to explore the impact of three strategies for better tuberculosis case finding. Strategies included: (1) reducing the number of tuberculosis patients who do not seek care; (2) reducing diagnostic delay; and (3) engaging non-DOTS providers in the referral of tuberculosis suspects to DOTS services in the Indonesian health system context. The impact of these strategies on tuberculosis mortality and treatment outcome was estimated using a mathematical model of the Indonesian health system. The model consists of multiple compartments representing logical movement of a respiratory symptomatic (tuberculosis suspect) through the health system, including patient- and health system delays. Main outputs of the model are tuberculosis death rate and treatment outcome (i.e. full or partial cure). We quantified the model parameters for the Jogjakarta province context, using a two round Delphi survey with five Indonesian tuberculosis experts. The model validation shows that four critical model outputs (average duration of symptom onset to treatment, detection rate, cure rate, and death rate) were reasonably close to existing available data, erring towards more optimistic outcomes than are actually reported. The model predicted that an intervention to reduce the proportion of tuberculosis patients who never seek care would have the biggest impact on tuberculosis death prevention, while an intervention resulting in more referrals of tuberculosis suspects to DOTS facilities would yield higher cure rates. This finding is similar for situations where the alternative sector is a more important health resource, such as in most other parts of Indonesia. We used mathematical modeling to explore the impact of Indonesian health system interventions on tuberculosis treatment outcome and deaths. Because detailed data were not available regarding the current Indonesian population, we relied on expert opinion to quantify the parameters. The fact that the model output showed similar results to epidemiological data suggests that the experts had an accurate understanding of this subject, thereby reassuring the quality of our predictions. The model highlighted the potential effectiveness of active case finding of tuberculosis patients with limited access to DOTS facilities in the developing country setting.
1 jpHMM: improving the reliability of recombination prediction in HIV-1. Previously, we developed jumping profile hidden Markov model (jpHMM), a new method to detect recombinations in HIV-1 genomes. The jpHMM predicts recombination breakpoints in a query sequence and assigns to each position of the sequence one of the major HIV-1 subtypes. Since incorrect subtype assignment or recombination prediction may lead to wrong conclusions in epidemiological or vaccine research, information about the reliability of the predicted parental subtypes and breakpoint positions is valuable. For this reason, we extended the output of jpHMM to include such information in terms of 'uncertainty' regions in the recombination prediction and an interval estimate of the breakpoint. Both types of information are computed based on the posterior probabilities of the subtypes at each query sequence position. Our results show that this extension strongly improves the reliability of the jpHMM recombination prediction. The jpHMM is available online at http://jphmm.gobics.de/.
0 Protein disorder in the human diseasome: unfoldomics of human genetic diseases. Intrinsically disordered proteins lack stable structure under physiological conditions, yet carry out many crucial biological functions, especially functions associated with regulation, recognition, signaling and control. Recently, human genetic diseases and related genes were organized into a bipartite graph (Goh KI, Cusick ME, Valle D, Childs B, Vidal M, et al. (2007) The human disease network. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 104: 8685-8690). This diseasome network revealed several significant features such as the common genetic origin of many diseases. We analyzed the abundance of intrinsic disorder in these diseasome network proteins by means of several prediction algorithms, and we analyzed the functional repertoires of these proteins based on prior studies relating disorder to function. Our analyses revealed that (i) Intrinsic disorder is common in proteins associated with many human genetic diseases; (ii) Different disease classes vary in the IDP contents of their associated proteins; (iii) Molecular recognition features, which are relatively short loosely structured protein regions within mostly disordered sequences and which gain structure upon binding to partners, are common in the diseasome, and their abundance correlates with the intrinsic disorder level; (iv) Some disease classes have a significant fraction of genes affected by alternative splicing, and the alternatively spliced regions in the corresponding proteins are predicted to be highly disordered; and (v) Correlations were found among the various diseasome graph-related properties and intrinsic disorder. These observations provide the basis for the construction of the human-genetic-disease-associated unfoldome.
2 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or primary surgery for stage III/IV ovarian cancer: contribution of diagnostic laparoscopy. The aims of this retrospective study were to evaluate laparoscopic triage of patients with advanced ovarian cancer towards primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and to analyze outcome according to the treatment. Between January 2001 and December 2006, 55 patients with stage III - IV ovarian cancer underwent diagnostic laparoscopy. Primary surgery was performed when complete cytoreduction was considered feasible, while the other patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (platinum-based combination with taxanes) and interval surgery. All the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 29) had a higher mean body mass index (P = 0.048), higher serum CA 125 levels (P = 0.026), and more metastases (P = 0.045) than patients treated with primary surgery (n = 26). In patients treated with primary surgery, complete cytoreduction and a residual tumour size <or= 2 cm were obtained in respectively 54% and 77% of cases. Complete cytoreduction was achieved in respectively 100% and 33% of cases when primary surgery was performed by an oncologic gynaecologist and by a non-oncologic gynaecologist (P = 0.002). Interval surgery yielded complete cytoreduction and a residual tumour size <or= 2 cm in respectively 73% and 85% of cases. With a median follow-up of 24 months (range 7 - 78 months), the survival rates after primary surgery and interval surgery were 61% and 66% respectively. Diagnostic laparoscopy is useful for identifying patients with stage III/IV ovarian cancer who qualify for primary cytoreduction. Surgeon experience was a determining factor for the success of complete cytoreduction.
0 A novel mutation in CRYAB associated with autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract in a Chinese family. To identify the genetic defects associated with autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract in a Chinese family. Clinical data were collected, and the phenotypes of the affected members in this family were recorded by slit-lamp photography. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood. Mutations were screened in cataract-associated candidate genes through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses and sequencing. Structural models of the wild-type and mutant alphaB-crystallin were generated and analyzed by SWISS-MODEL. Mutation screening identified only one heterozygous G-->A transition at nucleotide 32 in the first exon of alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB), resulting in an amino acid change from arginine to histidine at codon 11 (R11H). This mutation segregated in all available affected family members but was not observed in any of the unaffected persons of the family. The putative mutation disrupted a restriction site for the enzyme, Fnu4HI, in the affected family members. The disruption, however, was not found in any of the randomly selected ophthalmologically normal individuals or in 40 unrelated senile cataract patients. Computer-assisted prediction suggested that this mutation affected the biochemical properties as well as the structure of alphaB-crystallin. These results supported the idea that the novel R11H mutation was responsible for the autosomal dominant nuclear congenital cataract in this pedigree.
3 PPISearch: a web server for searching homologous protein-protein interactions across multiple species. As an increasing number of reliable protein-protein interactions (PPIs) become available and high-throughput experimental methods provide systematic identification of PPIs, there is a growing need for fast and accurate methods for discovering homologous PPIs of a newly determined PPI. PPISearch is a web server that rapidly identifies homologous PPIs (called PPI family) and infers transferability of interacting domains and functions of a query protein pair. This server first identifies two homologous families of the query, respectively, by using BLASTP to scan an annotated PPIs database (290 137 PPIs in 576 species), which is a collection of five public databases. We determined homologous PPIs from protein pairs of homologous families when these protein pairs were in the annotated database and have significant joint sequence similarity (E < or = 10(-40)) with the query. Using these homologous PPIs across multiple species, this sever infers the conserved domain-domain pairs (Pfam and InterPro domains) and function pairs (Gene Ontology annotations). Our results demonstrate that the transferability of conserved domain-domain pairs between homologous PPIs and query pairs is 88% using 103 762 PPI queries, and the transferability of conserved function pairs is 69% based on 106 997 PPI queries. The PPISearch server should be useful for searching homologous PPIs and PPI families across multiple species. The PPISearch server is available through the website at http://gemdock.life.nctu.edu.tw/ppisearch/.
0 Experimentally based contact energies decode interactions responsible for protein-DNA affinity and the role of molecular waters at the binding interface. A major obstacle towards understanding the molecular basis of transcriptional regulation is the lack of a recognition code for protein-DNA interactions. Using high-quality crystal structures and binding data on the promiscuous family of C(2)H(2) zinc fingers (ZF), we decode 10 fundamental specific interactions responsible for protein-DNA recognition. The interactions include five hydrogen bond types, three atomic desolvation penalties, a favorable non-polar energy, and a novel water accessibility factor. We apply this code to three large datasets containing a total of 89 C(2)H(2) transcription factor (TF) mutants on the three ZFs of EGR. Guided by molecular dynamics simulations of individual ZFs, we map the interactions into homology models that embody all feasible intra- and intermolecular bonds, selecting for each sequence the structure with the lowest free energy. These interactions reproduce the change in affinity of 35 mutants of finger I (R(2) = 0.998), 23 mutants of finger II (R(2) = 0.96) and 31 finger III human domains (R(2) = 0.94). Our findings reveal recognition rules that depend on DNA sequence/structure, molecular water at the interface and induced fit of the C(2)H(2) TFs. Collectively, our method provides the first robust framework to decode the molecular basis of TFs binding to DNA.
2 Cost-effectiveness of lifestyle modification in diabetic patients. OBJECTIVE To explore the potential long-term health and economic consequences of lifestyle interventions for diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A literature search was performed to identify interventions for diabetic patients in which lifestyle issues were addressed. We selected recent (2003-2008), randomized controlled trials with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. The long-term outcomes for these interventions, if implemented in the Dutch diabetic population, were simulated with a computer-based model. Costs and effects were discounted at, respectively, 4 and 1.5% annually. A lifelong time horizon was applied. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, taking account of variability in intervention costs and (long-term) treatment effects. RESULTS Seven trials with 147-5,145 participants met our predefined criteria. All interventions improved cardiovascular risk factors at > or =1 year follow-up and were projected to reduce cardiovascular morbidity over lifetime. The interventions resulted in an average gain of 0.01-0.14 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per participant. Health benefits were generally achieved at reasonable costs (< or =euro50,000/QALY). A self-management education program (X-PERT) and physical activity counseling achieved the best results with > or =0.10 QALYs gained and > or =99% probability to be very cost-effective (< or =euro20,000/QALY). CONCLUSIONS Implementation of lifestyle interventions would probably yield important health benefits at reasonable costs. However, essential evidence for long-term maintenance of health benefits was limited. Future research should be focused on long-term effectiveness and multiple treatment strategies should be compared to determine incremental costs and benefits of one over the other.
3 Platensimycin activity against mycobacterial beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases. There is an urgent need for the discovery and development of new drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, especially due to the recent emergence of multi-drug and extensively-drug resistant strains. Herein, we have examined the susceptibility of mycobacteria to the natural product platensimycin. We have demonstrated that platensimycin has bacteriostatic activity against the fast growing Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC = 14 microg/ml) and against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC = 12 microg/ml). Growth in the presence of paltensimycin specifically inhibited the biosynthesis of mycolic acids suggesting that the antibiotic targeted the components of the mycolate biosynthesis complex. Given the inhibitory activity of platensimycin against beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthases from Staphylococcus aureus, M. tuberculosis KasA, KasB or FabH were overexpressed in M. smegmatis to establish whether these mycobacterial KAS enzymes were targets of platensimycin. In M. smegmatis overexpression of kasA or kasB increased the MIC of the strains from 14 microg/ml, to 30 and 124 microg/ml respectively. However, overexpression of fabH on did not affect the MIC. Additionally, consistent with the overexpression data, in vitro assays using purified proteins demonstrated that platensimycin inhibited Mt-KasA and Mt-KasB, but not Mt-FabH. Our results have shown that platensimycin is active against mycobacterial KasA and KasB and is thus an exciting lead compound against M. tuberculosis and the development of new synthetic analogues.
1 Time-resolved flow-flash FT-IR difference spectroscopy: the kinetics of CO photodissociation from myoglobin revisited. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) difference spectroscopy has been proven to be a significant tool in biospectroscopy. In particular, the step-scan technique monitors structural and electronic changes at time resolutions down to a few nanoseconds retaining the multiplex advantage of FT-IR. For the elucidation of the functional mechanisms of proteins, this technique is currently limited to repetitive systems undergoing a rapid photocycle. To overcome this obstacle, we developed a flow-flash experiment in a miniaturised flow channel which was integrated into a step-scan FT-IR spectroscopic setup. As a proof of principle, we studied the rebinding reaction of CO to myoglobin after photodissociation. The use of microfluidics reduced the sample consumption drastically such that a typical step-scan experiment takes only a few 10 microliter [corrected] of a millimolar sample solution, making this method particularly interesting for the investigation of biological samples that are only available in small quantities. Moreover, the flow cell provides the unique opportunity to assess the reaction mechanism of proteins that cycle slowly or react irreversibly. We infer that this novel approach will help in the elucidation of molecular reactions as complex as those of vectorial ion transfer in membrane proteins. The potential application to the oxygen splitting reaction of cytochrome c oxidase is discussed.
3 Dark chocolate or tomato extract for prehypertension: a randomised controlled trial. Flavanol-rich chocolate and lycopene-rich tomato extract have attracted interest as potential alternative treatment options for hypertension, a known risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Treatment of prehypertension (SBP 120-139/DBP 80-89 mmHg) may forestall progression to hypertension. However, there has been only limited research into non-pharmacological treatment options for prehypertension. We investigated the effect of dark chocolate or tomato extract on blood pressure, and their acceptability as an ongoing treatment option in a prehypertensive population. Our trial consisted of two phases: a randomised controlled three-group-parallel trial over 12 weeks (phase 1) followed by a crossover of the two active treatment arms over an additional 12-week period (phase 2). Group 1 received a 50 g daily dose of dark chocolate with 70% cocoa containing 750 mg polyphenols, group 2 were allocated one tomato extract capsule containing 15 mg lycopene per day, and group 3 received one placebo capsule daily over 8 weeks followed by a 4-week washout period. In phase 2 the active treatment groups were crossed over to receive the alternative treatment. Median blood pressure, weight, and abdominal circumference were measured 4-weekly, and other characteristics including physical activity, general health, energy, mood, and acceptability of treatment were assessed by questionnaire at 0, 8 and 20 weeks. We analysed changes over time using a linear mixed model, and one time point differences using Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher's-Exact, or t-tests. Thirty-six prehypertensive healthy adult volunteers completed the 6-month trial. Blood pressure changes over time within groups and between groups were not significant and independent of treatment. Weight and other characteristics did not change significantly during the trial. However, a marked difference in acceptability between the two treatment forms (chocolate or capsule) was revealed (p < 0.0001). Half of the participants allocated to the chocolate treatment found it hard to eat 50 g of dark chocolate every day and 20% considered it an unacceptable long-term treatment option, whereas all participants found it easy and acceptable to take a capsule each day for blood pressure. Our study did not find a blood pressure lowering effect of dark chocolate or tomato extract in a prehypertensive population. Practicability of chocolate as a long-term treatment option may be limited. http://www.anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12609000047291.
0 Evaluation of three automated genome annotations for Halorhabdus utahensis. Genome annotations are accumulating rapidly and depend heavily on automated annotation systems. Many genome centers offer annotation systems but no one has compared their output in a systematic way to determine accuracy and inherent errors. Errors in the annotations are routinely deposited in databases such as NCBI and used to validate subsequent annotation errors. We submitted the genome sequence of halophilic archaeon Halorhabdus utahensis to be analyzed by three genome annotation services. We have examined the output from each service in a variety of ways in order to compare the methodology and effectiveness of the annotations, as well as to explore the genes, pathways, and physiology of the previously unannotated genome. The annotation services differ considerably in gene calls, features, and ease of use. We had to manually identify the origin of replication and the species-specific consensus ribosome-binding site. Additionally, we conducted laboratory experiments to test H. utahensis growth and enzyme activity. Current annotation practices need to improve in order to more accurately reflect a genome's biological potential. We make specific recommendations that could improve the quality of microbial annotation projects.
3 Are immigrant populations aware about their oral health status? A study among immigrants from Ethiopia. Evidence from Western countries indicates that there are fundamental discrepancies between self-perceived illness of immigrants and the provision of health care, according to the Western bio-medical health service model. These need to be understood in the planning and implementation stages of public health care programs for new immigrants. The objectives of the present study were to investigate self-perceived versus clinically diagnosed dental and periodontal health status among immigrants from Ethiopia. During 2004-2005, dental and periodontal health status was recorded among 340 Ethiopian immigrants, utilizing the DMFT and CPI indices. Additionally, participants were interviewed using a questionnaire which included perceived dental and periodontal health status. Sensitivity and specificity levels of this perception were calculated and compared with the published scientific literature. Regarding dental caries, according to the three operational cut-off points, sensitivity ranged from 70% to 81%, and specificity ranged from 56% to 67%. Regarding periodontal status, 75% of the subjects clinically diagnosed with periodontal pockets self-perceived a "bad" health status of gums (sensitivity) and 54% of the subjects diagnosed without periodontal pockets, reported a "good" health status of gums (specificity). These indications of perception levels were higher than a previous study conducted among native born Israelis. Minority ethnic groups should not be prejudicially regarded as less knowledgeable. This is illustrated by the unexpected high level of oral health status perception in the present population. Oral health promotion initiatives among immigrants should be based upon optimal descriptive data in order to accomplish the inherent social commitment to these diverse populations.
0 Association between a rare SNP in the second intron of human Agouti related protein gene and increased BMI. The agouti related protein (AGRP) is an endogenous antagonist of the melanocortin 4 receptor and is one of the most potent orexigenic factors. The aim of the present study was to assess the genetic variability of AGRP gene and investigate whether the previously reported SNP rs5030980 and the rs11575892, a SNP that so far has not been studied with respect to obesity is associated with increased body mass index (BMI). We determined the complete sequence of the AGRP gene and upstream promoter region in 95 patients with severe obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m2). Three polymorphisms were identified: silent mutation c.123G>A (rs34123523) in the second exon, non-synonymous mutation c.199G>A (rs5030980) and c.131-42C>T (rs11575892) located in the second intron. We further screened rs11575892 in a selected group of 1135 and rs5030980 in group of 789 participants from the Genome Database of Latvian Population and Latvian State Research Program Database. The CT heterozygotes of rs11575892 had significantly higher mean BMI value (p = 0.027). After adjustment for age, gender and other significant non-genetic factors (presence of diseases), the BMI levels remained significantly higher in carriers of the rs11575892 T allele (p = 0.001). The adjusted mean BMI value of CC genotype was 27.92 +/- 1.01 kg/m2 (mean, SE) as compared to 30.97 +/- 1.03 kg/m2 for the CT genotype. No association was found between rs5030980 and BMI. This study presents an association of rare allele of AGRP polymorphism in heterozygous state with increased BMI. The possible functional effects of this polymorphism are unclear but may relate to splicing defects.
0 LPS-induced genes in intestinal tissue of the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima. Metazoan immunity is mainly associated with specialized cells that are directly involved with the immune response. Nevertheless, both in vertebrates and invertebrates other organs might respond to immune activation and participate either directly or indirectly in the ongoing immune process. However, most of what is known about invertebrate immunity has been restricted to immune effector cells and little information is available on the immune responses of other tissues or organs. We now focus on the immune reactions of the intestinal tissue of an echinoderm. Our study employs a non-conventional model, the echinoderm Holothuria glaberrima, to identify intestinal molecules expressed after an immune challenge presented by an intra-coelomic injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The expression profiles of intestinal genes expressed differentially between LPS-injected animals and control sea water-injected animals were determined using a custom-made Agilent microarray with 7209 sea cucumber intestinal ESTs. Fifty (50) unique sequences were found to be differentially expressed in the intestine of LPS-treated sea cucumbers. Seven (7) of these sequences represented homologues of known proteins, while the remaining (43) had no significant similarity with any protein, EST or RNA database. The known sequences corresponded to cytoskeletal proteins (Actin and alpha-actinin), metabolic enzymes (GAPDH, Ahcy and Gnmt), metal ion transport/metabolism (major yolk protein) and defense/recognition (fibrinogen-like protein). The expression pattern of 11 genes was validated using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Nine of these corroborated the microarray results and the remaining two showed a similar trend but without statistical significance. Our results show some of the molecular events by which the holothurian intestine responds to an immune challenge and provide important information to the study of the evolution of the immune response.
3 Pch2 links chromosome axis remodeling at future crossover sites and crossover distribution during yeast meiosis. Segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I depends on appropriately positioned crossovers/chiasmata. Crossover assurance ensures at least one crossover per homolog pair, while interference reduces double crossovers. Here, we have investigated the interplay between chromosome axis morphogenesis and non-random crossover placement. We demonstrate that chromosome axes are structurally modified at future crossover sites as indicated by correspondence between crossover designation marker Zip3 and domains enriched for axis ensemble Hop1/Red1. This association is first detected at the zygotene stage, persists until double Holliday junction resolution, and is controlled by the conserved AAA+ ATPase Pch2. Pch2 further mediates crossover interference, although it is dispensable for crossover formation at normal levels. Thus, interference appears to be superimposed on underlying mechanisms of crossover formation. When recombination-initiating DSBs are reduced, Pch2 is also required for viable spore formation, consistent with further functions in chiasma formation. pch2Delta mutant defects in crossover interference and spore viability at reduced DSB levels are oppositely modulated by temperature, suggesting contributions of two separable pathways to crossover control. Roles of Pch2 in controlling both chromosome axis morphogenesis and crossover placement suggest linkage between these processes. Pch2 is proposed to reorganize chromosome axes into a tiling array of long-range crossover control modules, resulting in chiasma formation at minimum levels and with maximum spacing.
3 An integrated network approach identifies the isobutanol response network of Escherichia coli. Isobutanol has emerged as a potential biofuel due to recent metabolic engineering efforts. Here we used gene expression and transcription network connectivity data, genetic knockouts, and network component analysis (NCA) to map the initial isobutanol response network of Escherichia coli under aerobic conditions. NCA revealed profound perturbations to respiration. Further investigation showed ArcA as an important mediator of this response. Quinone/quinol malfunction was postulated to activate ArcA, Fur, and PhoB in this study. In support of this hypothesis, quinone-linked ArcA and Fur target expressions were significantly less perturbed by isobutanol under fermentative growth whereas quinol-linked PhoB target expressions remained activated, and isobutanol impeded growth on glycerol, which requires quinones, more than on glucose. In addition, ethanol, n-butanol, and isobutanol response networks were compared. n-Butanol and isobutanol responses were qualitatively similar, whereas ethanol had notable induction differences of pspABCDE and ndh, whose gene products manage proton motive force. The network described here could aid design and comprehension of alcohol tolerance, whereas the approach provides a general framework to characterize complex phenomena at the systems level.
0 The retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene is not associated with myopia, hypermetropia, and ocular biometric measures. The Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha (RARA) gene is a potential candidate gene for myopia due to its differential expression in animal models during experimentally induced myopia. To test for whether RARA is associated with myopia we have undertaken a case-control study assessing for associations between RARA and myopia, hypermetropia, and ocular biometric measures. A total of 802 Anglo-Celtic individuals were genotyped. Five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) in RARA with an r(2) of 0.8 and a minor allele frequency greater than 5% were selected for genotyping. Genotype frequencies of these 5 tSNPs were compared between individuals with emmetropia and those with myopia or hypermetropia. A quantitative analysis was also performed to assess associations with ocular biometric measures including axial length, corneal curvature and anterior chamber depth. We did not identify any significant association between tSNPs in RARA with either myopia or hypermetropia as qualitative traits. Neither did we identify any significant associations of these tSNPs with the quantitative traits of axial length, corneal curvature and anterior chamber depth. This is the first study to assess for associations between RARA and myopia, hypermetropia, and ocular biometric measures. Our findings suggest that variations in the nucleotide sequence of RARA are not associated with myopia, hypermetropia, or ocular biometric measures in our population.
3 Early MRI response monitoring of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma under treatment with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. New therapeutic principles in clinical oncology require the adjustment of response criteria to govern therapy decisions. For advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) a new era has recently begun by the approval of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. As a unique feature, HCC usually develops in a diseased liver and current imaging technologies employing classical response criteria have not been prospectively evaluated for this new treatment. MRI signal patterns were assessed in 21 advanced HCC patients receiving sorafenib. MRI was performed at baseline and in short-term intervals thereafter. Signal changes under therapy on T1WI, T2WI and post-gadolinium images including necrosis volume and its ratio to the entire tumor volume were compared to baseline imaging. To assess the association between the categorical variables, Fisher's exact tests were applied for a statistical analysis. Survey time ranged from 2-65 weeks, and a total of 39 target lesions were evaluated. Signal abnormalities during sorafenib therapy were disclosed by T1WI and T2WI in 15/21 patients. The predominant tumor signal change was hyperintensity on both T1WI and T2WI. Interestingly, most patients developed MRI signal changes within 4 weeks of therapy; in contrast, two non-responders did not show any signal alteration at follow-up. Under therapy, 16/21 patients presented with new or progressive necrosis, whereas 7 patients achieved temporarily >75% tumor necrosis under sorafenib. Significantly associated MRI variables were increase in T1WI signal and tumor necrosis (p = 0.017) as well as increase of tumor necrosis with an elevated ratio of necrotic to vital tumor areas (p = 0.002). Remarkably, some (3/13) of the patients developing necrotic tumor areas showed a relevant (>20%) increase in tumor volume, which should be considered in the assessment of imaging studies. As sorafenib induces early intralesional necrosis with profound changes in T1WI/T2WI MRI signal intensities and measurable necrotic tumor areas in most HCC patients, early MRI-based evaluation could pave the way for its rationale and cost-effective application.
2 Improving interval estimation of binomial proportions. In this paper, we propose one new confidence interval for the binomial proportion; our interval is based on the Edgeworth expansion of a logit transformation of the sample proportion. We provide theoretical justification for the proposed interval and also compare the finite-sample performance of the proposed interval with the three best existing intervals-the Wilson interval, the Agresti-Coull interval and the Jeffreys interval-in terms of their coverage probabilities and expected lengths. We illustrate the proposed method in two real clinical studies.
0 Evaluation of the possible transmission of BSE and scrapie to gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). In transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting many species, the key event in disease pathogenesis is the accumulation of an abnormal conformational isoform (PrP(Sc)) of the host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). While the precise mechanism of the PrP(C) to PrP(Sc) conversion is not understood, it is clear that host PrP(C) expression is a prerequisite for effective infectious prion propagation. Although there have been many studies on TSEs in mammalian species, little is known about TSE pathogenesis in fish. Here we show that while gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) orally challenged with brain homogenates prepared either from a BSE infected cow or from scrapie infected sheep developed no clinical prion disease, the brains of TSE-fed fish sampled two years after challenge did show signs of neurodegeneration and accumulation of deposits that reacted positively with antibodies raised against sea bream PrP. The control groups, fed with brains from uninfected animals, showed no such signs. Remarkably, the deposits developed much more rapidly and extensively in fish inoculated with BSE-infected material than in the ones challenged with the scrapie-infected brain homogenate, with numerous deposits being proteinase K-resistant. These plaque-like aggregates exhibited congophilia and birefringence in polarized light, consistent with an amyloid-like component. The neurodegeneration and abnormal deposition in the brains of fish challenged with prion, especially BSE, raises concerns about the potential risk to public health. As fish aquaculture is an economically important industry providing high protein nutrition for humans and other mammalian species, the prospect of farmed fish being contaminated with infectious mammalian PrP(Sc), or of a prion disease developing in farmed fish is alarming and requires further evaluation.
1 Structured chronic primary care and health-related quality of life in chronic heart failure. Structured care is proposed as a lever for improving care for patients with chronic conditions. The purpose of this study was to explore the associations of structured care characteristics, derived from the Chronic Care Model, with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and optimal clinical management in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients in primary care, as well as the association between optimal management and HRQOL. Cross-sectional observational study using multi-level random-coefficient analyses of a representative sample of 357 patients diagnosed with CHF from 42 primary care practices in the Netherlands. We combined individual medical record data with patient and physician questionnaires. There was large variation in the levels and presence of structured care elements. A 91% of physicians indicated that next appointments for CHF patients were made immediately after visits, while 11% indicated that reminders on CHF management were periodically received in their practice. Few associations were found between the organizational characteristics and optimal treatment or HRQOL. Optimal pharmacological treatment related to better quality of life (beta = -11.5, P < .0001). Also, more lifestyle advice was given in practices with an appointment system allowing contact with more than one professional during the encounter (beta = 1.0, P = .04). HRQOL and treatment quality in CHF patients were not consistently associated with characteristics of structured care in primary care practices.
2 Immunotherapy of distant metastatic disease. Immunotherapy of metastatic melanoma consists of various approaches leading to specific or non-specific immunomodulation. The use of FDA-approved interleukin (IL)-2 alone, in combination with interferon alpha, and/or with various chemotherapeutic agents (biochemotherapy) is associated with significant toxicity and poor efficacy that does not improve overall survival of 96% of patients. Many studies with allogeneic and autologous vaccines have demonstrated no clinical benefit, and some randomised trials even showed a detrimental effect in the vaccine arm. The ongoing effort to develop melanoma vaccines based on dendritic cells and peptides is driven by advances in understanding antigen presentation and processing, and by new techniques of vaccine preparation, stabilisation and delivery. Several agents that have shown promising activity in metastatic melanoma including IL-21 and monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or CD137 are discussed. Recent advances of intratumour gene transfer technologies and adoptive immunotherapy, which represents a promising although technically challenging direction, are also discussed.
3 Release of endogenous C3b inactivator from lymphocytes in response to triggering membrane receptors for beta 1H globulin. Human bone marrow-derived lymphocytes and cells from B lymphoblastoid lines were shown to have specific membrane receptors for beta 1H globin. Lymphocytes responded to the presence of beta 1H by releasing endogenously-synthesized C3b-inactivator. Very little spontaneous release of C3b-inactivator occurred in the absence of beta 1H. beta 1H-treated lymphocytes that either lacked complement receptor type one (CR1, the C4b-C3b receptor) or had their CR1 blocked with Fab'-anti-CR1 formed rosettes with C3b-coated sheep erythrocytes (EC3b) by adherence to complement receptor type two (CR2, the C3d-C3bi receptor). The mechanism of the beta 1H-induced EC3b rosette formation was shown to involve the release of lymphocyte C3b-inactivator that cleaved bound C3b into C3bi forming EC3bi. This lymphocytes-generated EC3bi then bound to CR2, forming rosettes. beta 1H-induced EC3b rosettes were completely inhibited by the presence of either anti-C3b-inactivator, F(ab')2-anti-CR2, Fab-anti-C3c, or Fab-anti-C3d, but were unaffected by the presence of fluid-phase concentrations of beta 1H up to 5.5 mg/ml or Fab'-anti-CR1. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography demonstrated that cell-free supernates of beta 1H-treated lymphocytes cleaved 3H-labeled C3b on EC3b into C3bi. Inhibition studies with chelating agents and sodium azide suggested that the release of C3b inactivator might involve a calcium and energy-dependent transport of this enzyme across the membranes of beta 1H-triggered cells. Because plasma beta 1H and C3b-inactivator are known to have important functions in the distinction of alternative pathway-activating substances from normal tissue, it is possible that this beta 1H receptor-C3b-inactivatory releasing system in lymphocytes may have an analogous function.
0 Phenotypic characterization of human cytolytic T lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte culture. Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)-activated T cells were analyzed according to the expression of various cell surface markers by the specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) generated in the MLR. CTL were found exclusively in a population of MLR-activated T cells that lacked detectable Fc gamma R but that expressed a surface antigen recognized by the 4F2 monoclonal antibody. In contrast, CTL were found in both the Ia-positive and Ia-negative cells after MLR activation. Thus, the specific CTL generated in the allogeneic MLR can be identified and isolated by virtue of the expression of a particular cell surface marker.
3 Expression of HLA-B27 in transgenic mice is dependent on the mouse H-2D genes. HLA-B27 transgenic mice in the context of various H-2 haplotypes were produced. A high expression of the HLA-B27 antigen was observed in mice homozygous for H-2b, H-2f, H-2s, H-2p, H-2r, and H-2k haplotypes. Mice of the H-2v haplotype expressed HLA-B27 at an intermediate level. Expression of HLA-B27 was minimal in mice of the H-2q and H-2d haplotypes. This was observed both on the B10 background and in DBA/2 or BALB/c mice. Only minimal expression of HLA-B27 could be detected in B10.PL (KuDd) or B10.RKDB (KkSkDdLb) mice, indicating that the low level of HLA-B27 expression maps to the H-2D gene or a very closely linked gene. Integration and transcription of the HLA-B27 gene does not appear to be different between high-expressing haplotypes and low-expressing haplotypes as determined by Southern and Northern blot analysis. However, expression of HLA-B27 on the cell surface correlated with the amount of HLA-B27 and beta 2M that could be immunoprecipitated with an anti-B27 antibody. Therefore, the association of the B27 heavy chain with endogenous beta 2M and subsequent expression on the cell surface are disrupted in mice with some class I H-2D genes. Possible mechanisms that might contribute to this defect in assembly, transport, and expression of class I molecules are discussed.
3 Human gamma interferon strongly upregulates its own gene expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The product of the human IFN-gamma gene was found to be a powerful upregulatory stimulus for its own gene expression in lectin-activated human PBMC. The INF-gamma autosuperinduction response was further enhanced by "priming" PBMC with IFN-gamma. Primed cells maximally upregulated their levels of IFN-gamma specific mRNA 4-fold faster and more than 20-fold higher than mock-stimulated cells. High mRNA levels persisted for several days after stimulation, and enhanced secretion of biologically active IFN-gamma paralleled the observed upregulation of gene expression. Producer cells demonstrating this response were found to be primarily localized to the rosette E- (leu 11+) fraction of PBMC and appear to be of the LGL/NK variety. Whether the autosuperinduction phenomenon occurs through direct or indirect effects of IFN-gamma on producer cells is still unclear. These results may be important both to an understanding of the pathogenesis of immune dysfunction and to the design of more effective immunotherapy.
3 Selective enrichment of major histocompatibility complex class II-specific autoreactive T cells in the thymic Thy0 subset. We show here a unique enrichment of autoreactive T cells in the CD4+ mouse thymic subset, Thy0. A single- and 10-cell AMLR (autologous mixed leukocyte reaction) assay demonstrates that more than 30% (one cell per well) and almost all (10 cells per well) Thy0 cultures from normal mice exhibit reactivity specific to autologous cells, resulting in induction of interleukin 3 secretion. In contrast, no other mature thymic or splenic CD4+ T cell subsets showed such a high frequency. The majority of this AMLR reactivity in the Thy0 subset is accounted for by reactivity with self-major histocompatibility complex class II. Furthermore, antigenic selection in generating Thy0 subset is suggested by studies with T cell hybrids from a T cell receptor (TCR) V beta transgenic mouse line, 2B4 beta EH. TCR V-gene analysis of T cell hybrids revealed that those from Thy0, half of which responded to self-class II, consisted predominantly of cells that expressed endogenous TCR V beta s alone (without the transgene), unlike hybrids generated from peripheral naive T cells. Thus, we suggest that the presence of Thy0 results from selective stimulation of cells expressing TCR with sufficient affinity for autoantigens in the thymic CD4+ T cell repertoire.
3 Molecular mechanism for feedback regulation of C4 biosynthesis in guinea pig peritoneal macrophage. Previous reports have shown that regulation of local extrahepatic production of complement may not reflect the regulation of plasma concentrations of the corresponding proteins and, further, that alteration of the tissue microenvironment can affect local macrophage protein synthesis. This report describes the molecular basis for control of the biosynthesis and secretion of a class III major histocompatibility complex gene product, the fourth component of complement (C4), from guinea pig macrophages by extracellular native C4 protein. The effect is specific for C4 synthesis, since production of C2 and total secreted protein was unaffected by fluid phase C4. C4 synthesis by extracellular C4 is regulated at a pretranslational level, without an effect on posttranslational proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, or secretion. Specific C4 and factor B cDNA probes were used to demonstrate, by dot hybridization and Northern blot analysis, a decrease in messenger RNA coding for C4 that paralleled the inhibition of C4 biosynthesis, while the amount of total RNA and mRNA specific for factor B remained constant. Inhibition of C4 biosynthesis and the disappearance of mRNA encoding C4 occurred between 4 and 6 h after exposure of the macrophages to biologically active or methylamine-inactivated C4 protein. These data demonstrate that regulation of C4 biosynthesis by guinea pig macrophages serves as a model for the study of the molecular mechanisms of macrophage activation as well as the control of production of a component of the inflammatory response.
3 The inability to process a self-peptide allows autoreactive T cells to escape tolerance. It is now clear that antigen presenting cells (APCs) do not present all the possible peptides of self-proteins to the immune system. When then, is the fate of T cells specific for those self-peptides that escape processing? In this study, the COOH-terminal peptide (residues 81-104) of self cytochrome c (cyt c) elicited strong autoimmune T cells, as well as autoantibodies specific for this immunogen. These T cells did not respond to stimulation with the whole self cyt c molecule, demonstrating that APCs cannot process and present the self 81-104 peptide. Whereas mice were unresponsive to immunization with the whole mouse cyt c molecule, the mouse 81-104 fragment together with the whole self-molecule induced and amplified the autoimmune T cell response to sites within the 1-80 peptide. T cells that never contact the relevant self-peptide are functionally ignorant. They do not become tolerized or deleted, nor do they normally participate in immune responses to the native whole self-protein, since APCs cannot present the 81-104 peptide.
0 Identification of the sequence required for expression of the 2H4 epitope on the human leukocyte common antigens. The anti-2H4 antibody, which subdivides the T4+ population of human T lymphocytes into T4+, 2H4+ suppressor-inducer cells and T4+, 2H4- helper cells, recognizes an epitope on a subset of the human leukocyte common antigens (LCAs). LCAs are a family of cell surface glycoproteins generated from a single gene by the differential usage of three exons near the NH2-terminus. Using cDNA clones corresponding to four of the different forms of LCA molecules, extracellular domains of the LCA molecules were synthesized in vitro. Immunoprecipitation of these molecules with the anti-2H4 antibody demonstrated that exon A is required for the expression of the 2H4 epitope.
0 Autoantibody-associated kappa light chain variable region gene expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia with little or no somatic mutation. Implications for etiology and immunotherapy. Recently the minor B cell subpopulation that expresses the CD5 (Leu-1) antigen has been implicated as a source of IgM autoantibodies. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in humans, represents a malignancy of small B lymphocytes that also express the CD5 antigen. However, little is known concerning the antibody variable region genes (V genes) that are used by these malignant CD5 B cells. We have found that a relatively high frequency of CLL patients have leukemic B cells with surface immunoglobulin (sIg) recognized by 17.109, a murine mAb specific for a kappa light chain associated crossreactive idiotype (CRI) associated with rheumatoid factor and other IgM autoantibodies. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the relative expression of the 17.109-CRI by circulating leukemic B cells was directly proportional to the levels of sIg kappa light chain, indicating that there exists stable idiotype expression in the leukemic population. To examine this at the molecular level, the nucleic acid sequences encoding the Ig kappa light chains of two unrelated patients with CLL bearing sIg with the 17.109-CRI were determined. Analyses of multiple independent kappa light chain cDNA clones did not reveal any evidence for sequence heterogeneity in the CLL cell population. Furthermore, the nucleic acid sequences expressed by the leukemic cells of these two patients were identical or very homologous to a germline V kappa gene isolated from placental DNA, designated Humkv 325, or "V kappa RF" because of its association with IgM autoantibodies. This study suggests; (a) that the malignant CD5+ B lymphocytes in CLL use the same V kappa gene that has been highly associated with IgM autoantibodies and (b) that the expression of V genes is stable in CLL, in contrast to other B cell malignancies examined to date. We propose that many CLL cases represent malignancies of autoreactive CD5 B cells that use a restricted set of conserved V genes. This property may render CLL particularly amenable to immunotherapy with antiidiotypic antibodies.
3 Hybridoma antibodies against protective and nonprotective antigenic determinants of a structurally defined polypeptide fragment of streptococcal M protein. Hybridoma technology was used to produce a set of monoclonal antibodies against a purified polypeptide fragment of type 24 streptococcal M protein to delineate the protective determinants of M protein exposed on the surface of the virulent streptococci. Several hybridoma antibodies were found to be opsonic against the homologous type streptococci. At least two of these antibodies (IIC3.7 and IIC4.6) protected mice against challenge infections with the homologous, but not a heterologous, serotype of bacteria. One of the hybridoma antibodies that reacted in high dilution (1:204,800) with the isolated M protein failed to react with the M protein on the surface of type 24 streptococci, and thus did not opsonize the homologous organisms or protect mice against challenge infections. Because hybridoma antibodies are directed against a single distinct immunodeterminant, these results indicate that protective immunity may be directed at any one of several distinct antigenic determinants of M protein exposed on the surface of virulent group A streptococci.
3 Anti-idiotype sera raised against surface immunoglobulin of human neoplastic lymphocytes. The idiotypic determinants of surface immunoglobulins on B-cell lymphomas and lymphocytic leukemias represent tumor-specific antigens, individually unique for each tumor. As such they have both diagnostic and therapeutic potential, particularly for those neoplasms with no serum monoclonal immunoglobulin arising from synthesis of the protein for export. We describe the raising in animals of anti-idiotype sera directed against two examples of a nonexporting neoplasm, human chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The procedure involves exposing the cells to papain so as to remove the Fab fragments (containing the idiotypic determinants) from the surface immunoglobulin, recovering the Fab on cellulose immunosorbent particles, and immunizing animals with the immunosorbent-Fab complex.
2 Adoptive transfer studies demonstrating the antiviral effect of natural killer cells in vivo. We carried out adoptive transfer studies to determine the role of natural killer (NK) cells in resistance to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We transferred leukocytes from adult mice into suckling mice 1 d before injecting them with virus. Resistance was measured by enhancement of survival and reduction of virus multiplication in the spleens of recipient mice. The phenotype of the cell population capable of mediating resistance to MCMV was that of a nylon wool-nonadherent, asialo GM1+, NK 1.2+, Ly-5+, Thy-1-, Ia-, low density lymphocyte; this is the phenotype of an NK cell. Cloned NK cells, but not cloned T cells, provided resistance to MCMV in suckling mice. Cloned NK cells also provided resistance to MCMV in irradiated adult mice, and antibody to asialo GM1, which depletes NK cell activity in vivo, enhanced the synthesis of MCMV in athymic nude mice. Neither adult leukocytes nor cloned NK cells influenced LCMV synthesis in suckling mice. We conclude that a general property of NK cells may be to provide natural resistance to virus infections, and that NK cells can protect mice from MCMV but not from LCMV.
1 Purification of human interleukin 2 to apparent homogeneity and its molecular heterogeneity. Interleukin 2 (IL-2), produced with and without co-stimulation by the Burkitt's lymphoma line Daudi, was purified 37,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from lymphocyte conditioned medium by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and chromatography on blue agarose and on Procion-red agarose. The purified IL-2 showed a 10(6) U/mg protein sp act. IL-2 produced in the absence of Daudi cells had a mol wt of 26,000 as measured by gel filtration and an isoelectric point of 6.7. This IL-2 showed a 16,000 and 17,000 mol wt in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). IL-2, produced in the presence of Daudi cells (10(6)/ml), showed a mol wt of approximately 14,000, as measured by both gel filtration and SDS-PAGE, and an isoelectric point of 8.1. The purified IL-2 lacked detectable interferon (alpha and gamma), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, B cell growth factor, T cell-replacing factor, and thymocyte-differentiating activity and was free of any contaminating proteins as judged by silver staining in SDS-PAGE. All three molecular forms of IL-2 were biologically active at concentrations of 10(-11) - 10(-10) M, supporting the growth of human and murine cytotoxic T cell lines.
1 Localization of aggregated cell surface antigens of target cells bound to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The redistribution of aggregated cell surface antigens of target cells bound to cytotoxic T lymphocytes was investigated. It was found that cap formation induced by antibody always occurred toward the site of binding. It is suggested that the polar localization of capped target cell surface determinants is a consequence of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte target cell interaction.
1 Alteration of amino acid 101 within capsid protein VP-1 changes the pathogenicity of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Chronic Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of susceptible mice is an animal model for human demyelinating diseases. Previously we described an altered and diminished pattern of central nervous system disease in immunocompetent SJL/J mice infected with a variant virus. This variant virus H7A6-2 was selected with a neutralizing mAb recognizing the capsid protein VP-1 of Theiler's virus. Here we characterize the variant virus by ELISA and neutralization assays and by sequencing selected regions of the viral RNA genome and relate the alteration to disease. The variant virus contains one single point mutation within a neutralizing epitope of VP-1. This nucleotide change lead to an amino acid replacement at amino acid 101 of VP-1, a threonine (wild type) to an isoleucine (variant). Model building based on sequence alignments and the known structure of the related Mengo virus indicates that the altered amino acid is located in an exposed loop on the surface of the virus at the periphery of a site that has been proposed to be the receptor binding site. The results of ELISA, neutralization assay, and direct RNA sequencing provide for the first time an opportunity to precisely map an important structural determinant of neurovirulence.
3 CD40 and IgE: synergism between anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody and interleukin 4 in the induction of IgE synthesis by highly purified human B cells. A novel pathway of IgE-B cell differentiation has been identified. Engagement of the B cell antigen CD40 by F(ab')2 fragments of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 626.1 in the presence of recombinant interleukin 4 (rIL-4) induced intense IgE synthesis, but modest IgG synthesis, by highly purified human B cells. Surface IgE- B cells isolated by cell sorting were induced to produce IgE by mAb 626.1 and IL-4. Thus, IgE synthesis is unlikely to result from expansion of a B cell population precommitted to IgE in vivo. A neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody strongly, but not completely, inhibited the IgE response. This indicates that autocrine production of IL-6 plays an important amplification role in IgE synthesis triggered by anti-CD40 mAb and IL-4. Although the exact role played by CD40 in IgE responses in vivo remains to be established, this T cell-independent system represents a useful model to characterize the biochemical and molecular events leading to IgE synthesis in human B cells.
0 Double isotype production by a neoplastic B cell line. II. Allelically excluded production of mu and gamma 1 heavy chains without CH gene rearrangement. In our accompanying paper, we described a switch variant (BCL1.2.58) that expresses membrane and secreted forms of IgM and IgG1. Both IgM and IgG1 share the same idiotype and use the same VDJ rearrangement. Here, a detailed Southern blot analysis of the entire constant region of the Ig heavy chain (Ig CH) locus of parental (BCL1.B1) and variants (BCL1.B2) DNA showed no detectable rearrangement. Similar analysis of the JH-C mu region led to the conclusion that two heavy chain alleles present in the IgM/IgG1-producing variants carried the same VDJ rearrangement but differed in their 3' flanking regions. One chromosome 12 did not carry any Ig CH genes, whereas, the other chromosome 12 carried one copy of CH genes. In BCL1.B1, however, each of the chromosome 12 alleles carried a full copy of CH genes. Karyotypic analysis confirmed the presence of two translocated t(12;16) chromosomes in both BCL1.2.58 and BCL1.B1 cells, with a break 5' to the VH locus at the distal region (12F2) of chromosome 12, and at the proximal region below the centromere (16B3) of chromosome 16. We conclude that double production of IgM and IgG1 in BCL1.B2 is accomplished by transcription of the corresponding CH genes in germline configuration using a single VDJ on the same chromosome 12.
3 Selective abrogation of antigen-specific human B cell responses by antigen-ricin conjugates. The feasibility of selectively eliminating human antigen-specific B cell responses by treating cells in vitro with antigen covalently linked to a cell toxin was examined. Tetanus toxoid (TT) was conjugated to the toxin ricin via a thioether linkage. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from recently immunized subjects were preincubated for 2 h with TT-ricin in the presence of lactose. Antigen was then removed, and the cells from recently immunized subjects were preincubated for 2 h with TT-ricin in the presence of lactose. Antigen was then removed, and the cells were stimulated with pokeweed mitogen to induce antibody production. TT-specific antibody production was completely abrogated by preincubation with TT-ricin but not by TT alone or a mixture of TT and ricin. In contrast, polyclonal immunoglobulin production was not diminished by TT-ricin. This selective abrogation was also seen when B cells alone were preincubated with TT-ricin and a source of T cell help was later provided. T cell blastogenic responses to TT remained intact after TT-ricin exposure. Thus, antigen-toxin conjugates are capable of selectively eliminating specific antibody-producing B cell clones, while leaving intact the remainder of the B cell repertoire.
3 Long-term erythropoietic repopulating ability of old, young, and fetal stem cells. It is possible that erythropoietic stem cells do not age. This would mean that stem cells from old donors can function as well as those from young or fetal donors. The competitive repopulation assay has been used to test long-term stem cell function by directly comparing how well competing stem cells repopulate a recipient and produce differentiated cell types. C57BL/6J (B6) mice were used as donors, while recipients and competitors were WBB6F1 hybrids with genetically distinguishable hemoglobin. Lethally irradiated young WBB6F1 recipients were given a mixture of 2.5 X 10(6) cells from B6 old marrow, young marrow, or fetal liver donors; each recipient also received a standard dose of 1 X 10(6) marrow cells from a pool of young WBB6F1 competitors. Surprisingly, the old marrow cells competed the best in repopulating the recipients. This pattern was maintained even after recovery from sublethal irradiation, a treatment that severely stresses stem cells. This stress was demonstrated when sublethal irradiation caused a 20-fold decline in repopulating ability measured using hemoglobin markers, and a 3- to 7-fold decline using chromosome markers. Stem cells from old marrow competed better than young or fetal cells in similar experiments using immunologically crippled recipients or using unirradiated W/Wv recipients that are immunologically intact. In both types of recipients, the advantage of old marrow cells again persisted after recovery from sublethal irradiation. Other genotypes were tested, and marrow cells from old B6CBAF1 donors competed better than those from young donors of that genotype. However, marrow cells from young CBA donors completed better than those from old CBA donors. These results support the hypothesis that stem cells do not age, and suggest that regulatory changes with age promote rapid stem cell repopulation in B6 and B6CBAF1 mice, but inhibit it in CBA mice.
2 H-2 restriction of virus-specific cytotoxicity across the H-2 barrier. Separate effector T-cell specificities are associated with self-H-2 and with the tolerated allogeneic H-2 in chimeras. During infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis or vaccinia virus, F1 irradiation chimeras reconstituted with bone marrow cells from or both parents generate cytotoxic T cells which can lyse targets across the H-2 barrier. However, activity of chimera T cells is H-2 restricted as shown by cold target competition experiments and selective restimulation of a secondary response in vitro; T cells of H-2k specificity which lyse tolerated infected H-2d target cells do not lyse infected H-2k or unrelated target cells and vice versa. Therefore, H-2 restriction of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells probably does not reflect need for like-like self-interactions for lysis to occur. The specificity of virus immune T cells is thus determined by the H-2K and H-2D specificities present in the infected animal and which are probably recognized unidirectionally by T cells. The results are compatible with the idea the T cells are specific for "altered alloantigen", i.e., a complex of cell surface marker and viral antigen. Alternatively, explained with a dual recognition model, T cells may possess two independently, clonally expressed receptors, a self-recognizer which is expressed for one of the syngeneic or tolerated allogeneic K or D "self" markers, and an immunologically specific receptor for viral antigen.
3 Generation of the neutrophil-activating peptide NAP-2 from platelet basic protein or connective tissue-activating peptide III through monocyte proteases. We studied the origin of the neutrophil-activating peptide NAP-2, a presumed 70 amino acid cleavage product of platelet basic protein (PBP) and connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III). Purified human blood monocytes or lymphocytes were cultured with or without stimuli (LPS or PHA) in the presence or absence of platelet-release supernatant, and the formation of NAP-2 and other neutrophil-activating peptides was monitored. NAP-2 was generated whenever monocytes and platelet release supernatant were present. When a monocyte stimulus was added, NAF/NAP-1 was also formed, and in the presence of LPS a third, less potent neutrophil-stimulating fraction, consisting of NAP-2 variants with 73, 74, and 75 residues, also appeared. Monocytes alone did not yield NAP-2 and no neutrophil-activating peptide was generated by lymphocytes. The monocyte-conditioned medium was found to cleave purified CTAP-III into NAP-2 through proteinases that were highly sensitive to PMSF, moderately sensitive to leupeptin and insensitive to EDTA.
3 A major anti-myoglobin idiotype. Influence of H-2-linked Ir genes on idiotype expression. A rabbit antiidiotypic antiserum raised against an A.SW IgG1K monoclonal anti-sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) antibody, HAL19, and extensively absorbed with normal mouse immunoglobulin and MOPC 21 (IgG1K), was found to detect a common or major anti-Mb idiotype expressed by some but not all anti-Mb monoclonal antibodies, regardless of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass, and by 40-50% of the anti-Mb antibodies in immune serum from five high responder strains of mice representing five different Igh allotypes. It did not inhibit antibodies to three unrelated protein antigens. The fraction of antibodies expressing this idiotype, denoted IdHAL19, was regulated by H-2-linked genes that correlated exactly in four independent haplotypes and an F1 with the known Mb immune response (Ir) genes and may be identical to these. Whereas less than 50% of antibodies from high responder mice were inhibitable by anti-IdHAL19, greater than 80% of antibodies from low responder mice, tested at comparable final antibody concentration, were inhibitable. This result was true for both low responder haplotypes, H-2b (B10) and H-2k (B10.BR). The idiotype was found to be present on antibodies that bound to native Mb but not fragments 1-55 or 132-153 of Mb or a denatured form, S-methyl Mb. This specificity for native Mb paralleled that of the monoclonal idiotype HAL19 itself. Therefore, the production of antibodies specific for native in contrast to denatured Mb was studied in H-2-congenic high and low responder strains. Strikingly, low responders produced antibodies that reacted almost exclusively with the native conformation, whereas a larger proportion of antibodies from high responder mice also reacted with the denatured form, S-methyl Mb. Bypassing of the Ir gene defect by immunization with Mb attached to a carrier, F gamma G, resulted in low responder antisera resembling higher responder sera in both idiotype expression and conformational specificity. The simplest explanation of these results is that H-2-linked Ir genes control antibody fine specificity, which is reflected in the idiotypes of the variable regions expressed. We suggest that low responder mice produce a more limited repertoire of antibodies consisting primarily of IdHAL19-positive antibodies specific for the native conformation of Mb. High responder mice produce a greater diversity of antibodies to Mb, so that the IdHAL19-positive, conformation-specific population represents a smaller proportion of the total. Similarly, the use of carrier-specific helper T cells in low responder mice results in a greater diversity of antibodies, which dilutes out the IdHAL19 subset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3 Impaired measles virus-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in multiple sclerosis. To assess whether an virus-specific immune defect may be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), we have examined the ability to generate measles virus-and influenza virus-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) in patients with MS, normal individuals, and other disease controls (ODC). The mean (+/- SEM) measles virus-specific CTL response for normal individuals and ODC was 26.9 +/- 2.9% (N = 17) and 26.7 +/- 2.8% (N = 13) specific lysis, respectively. In contrast, the capacity of MS patients to generate measles virus-specific CTL was markedly diminished. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from MS patients stimulated with measles virus lysed their measles virus-infected autologous B cell line at a group mean level of 6.0 +/- 1.4% (N = 16) specific lysis. MS patients had significantly lower measles virus-specific CTL responses than normal individuals (p less than 0.00001) or ODC (p less than 0.0001). Importantly, this lowered response did not reflect a generalized depressed cytolytic activity of MS patients, since influenza virus-specific CTL and NK activity from these patients were comparable to normals and ODC. Thus, in MS there is a significant depression of measles virus-specific CTL which suggests that this virus-specific immune dysfunction may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.
0 Immunocytochemical detection of interleukin 1 within stimulated human monocytes. We have used synthetic peptides coupled to KLH to raise high titer antisera to human IL-1 beta, and in the present report show the usefulness of these sera for immunocytochemical analyses of IL-1 production. Using indirect immunofluorescence, we have been able to specifically identify IL-1 within human monocytes and to monitor its accumulation with time. After indirect immunofluorescent staining of LPS- and PHA-stimulated mononuclear cell cultures, intense cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed in 93% of the monocytes, but not in lymphocytes or platelets present in the same preparation. Unstimulated monocytes did not contain immunocytochemically detectable IL-1. When put into culture, however, some of the otherwise unstimulated monocytes subsequently showed a transient accumulation of intracellular IL-1. Monocytes cultured in the presence of LPS and PHA exhibited detectable fluorescence after 2.5 h, and the fluorescent intensity of these cells continued to increase over the course of 21 h. Fluorescent staining was abolished by preincubation of the sera with relevant but not irrelevant peptide, and while preimmune or anti-KLH serum produced no staining, antisera against either the amino terminus or an internal region of IL-1 beta produced identical staining patterns. Immunoblot analyses of lysates from stimulated monocytes showed that the antisera against IL-1 recognize a single intracellular species with an apparent molecular weight (33 kD) similar to that predicted for IL-1 precursor from the nucleotide sequence of IL-1 cDNA. The ability to specifically identify and immunocytochemically localize IL-1 within producing cells should prove extremely useful for studying the in situ production of IL-1 in immune-based and inflammatory diseases.
3 Interferon enhances the susceptibility of virus-infected fibroblasts to cytotoxic T cells. Interferon (IFN) pretreatment of low-passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or vaccinia virus rendered these cells two to three times more susceptible to lysis by H-2 restricted, virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) than control, virus-infected MEF. The increased sensitivity to lysis correlated with increased expression of surface H-2 antigens, but not viral antigens. Continuous cell lines already highly sensitive to CTL-mediated lysis and already expressing high levels of surface H-2 antigens were unaffected by IFN pretreatment. These results suggest that IFN treatment, by increasing surface H-2 levels, may result in increased association of surface H-2 and virus antigens, leading to enhanced recognition and lysis by virus-specific CTL.
0 The role of DNA damage repair in aging of adult stem cells. DNA repair maintains genomic stability and the loss of DNA repair capacity results in genetic instability that may lead to a decline of cellular function. Adult stem cells are extremely important in the long-term maintenance of tissues throughout life. They regenerate and renew tissues in response to damage and replace senescent terminally differentiated cells that no longer function. Oxidative stress, toxic byproducts, reduced mitochondrial function and external exposures all damage DNA through base modification or mis-incorporation and result in DNA damage. As in most cells, this damage may limit the survival of the stem cell population affecting tissue regeneration and even longevity. This review examines the hypothesis that an age-related loss of DNA damage repair pathways poses a significant threat to stem cell survival and longevity. Normal stem cells appear to have strict control of gene expression and DNA replication whereas stem cells with loss of DNA repair may have altered patterns of proliferation, quiescence and differentiation. Furthermore, stem cells with loss of DNA repair may be susceptible to malignant transformation either directly or through the emergence of cancer-prone stem cells. Human diseases and animal models of loss of DNA repair provide longitudinal analysis of DNA repair processes in stem cell populations and may provide links to the physiology of aging.
3 Environmental tobacco smoke in hospitality venues in Greece. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a major threat to public health. Greece, having the highest smoking prevalence in the European Union is seriously affected by passive smoking. The purpose of this study was to measure environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in the non smoking areas of hospitality venues and offices in Greece and to compare the levels of exposure to levels in the US, UK and Ireland before and after the implementation of a smoking ban. Experimental measurements of particulate matter 2.5 microm (PM2.5), performed during a cross sectional study of 49 hospitality venues and offices in Athens and Crete, Greece during February - March 2006. Levels of ETS ranged from 19 microg/m3 to 612 microg/m3, differing according to the place of measurement. The average exposure in hospitality venues was 268 microg/m3 with ETS levels found to be highest in restaurants with a mean value of 298 microg/m3 followed by bars and cafes with 271 microg/m3. ETS levels were 76% lower in venues in which smoking was not observed compared to all other venues (p < 0.001). ETS levels in Greek designated non-smoking areas are similar to those found in the smoking sections of UK hospitality venues while levels in Ireland with a total smoking ban are 89% lower and smoke-free communities in the US are 91 - 96% lower than levels in Greece. Designated non-smoking areas of hospitality venues in Greece are significantly more polluted with ETS than outdoor air and similar venues in Europe and the United States. The implementation of a total indoor smoking ban in hospitality venues has been shown to have a positive effect on workers and patrons' health. The necessity of such legislation in Greece is thus warranted.
2 Interferon gamma, a mediator of lethal lipopolysaccharide-induced Shwartzman-like shock reactions in mice. The involvement of cytokines in the pathogenesis of a generalized, Shwartzman-like lethal inflammatory response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) was studied by testing the ability of cytokines or neutralizing anticytokine antibodies to modify the course of the syndrome. The reaction was elicitable in non-SPF NMRI mice by two consecutive injections of S. marcescens LPS: a first injection in the footpad, followed after 24 h by an intravenous dose; the size and route of the preparatory LPS dose were found to be critical. Treatment with mAbs against IFN-gamma was found to completely prevent the reaction. Treatment with IFN-gamma on the other hand, rendered the mice more sensitive to elicitation of the reaction. In contrast, systemic administration of IFN-alpha/beta exerted a desensitizing effect. The role of endogenous cytokines in the pathogenesis of this generalized Shwartzman reaction was also documented by a study of the cytokine levels in the serum of the mice. In comparisons between mice given lethal and nonlethal induction schedules, a good correlation was found between mortality rates and height of IFN or TNF levels, but no correlation was seen with IL-6 levels. Also, in mice that were protected by anti-IFN-gamma antibody, serum IFN and TNF were undetectable, whereas IL-6 levels were as high as in unprotected mice. These data provide evidence that among the cytokines that govern the inflammatory response to LPS, endogenous IFN-gamma occupies a key position. These findings therefore also open perspectives for clinical application of IFN-gamma antagonists.
3 Intrathymic differentiation of V gamma 3 T cells. Whereas there is considerable information on the phenotypic and functional maturation of T cell receptor (TCR) alpha/beta thymocytes, comparatively little is known of the maturational processes that affect development of TCR-gamma/delta thymocytes. One class of gamma/delta T cells, those bearing the V gamma 3 gene product, are generated only during the early fetal stages of thymic development, and then migrate to the skin. Here we examine the intrathymic differentiation of these V gamma 3+ cells. The earliest V gamma 3 cells to appear in the thymus expressed low levels of TCR (V gamma 3low) and high levels of heat stable antigen (HSA). Over the next few days, V gamma 3+ thymocytes appeared which expressed high levels of TCR (V gamma 3high) and very low levels of HSA. The antigens CD5, CD45RB, and MEL14 were also differentially expressed on V gamma 3low versus V gamma 3high thymocytes, but the shift in expression was the opposite as compared with immature and mature TCR-alpha/beta thymocytes. Transfer experiments of sorted V gamma 3low/HSAhigh thymocytes to SCID thymic lobes showed that these cells were indeed the precursors of V gamma 3high/HSAlow thymocytes. The phenotype of the V gamma 3high thymocytes was similar to that of the postthymic V gamma 3+ cells found in the skin of adult mice. The differentiation of V gamma 3low in V gamma 3high thymocytes was also observed in fetal thymic organ culture. Addition of cyclosporin A (CsA) to these cultures had little effect on the appearance of V gamma 3low/HSAhigh cells, but blocked the appearance of V gamma 3high/HSAlow cells. These results show that, like alpha/beta T cells, V gamma 3+ thymocytes differentiate from TCRlow precursors to cells with a mature phenotype and that CsA inhibits this transition.
2 Distinct fates of self-specific T cells developing in irradiation bone marrow chimeras: clonal deletion, clonal anergy, or in vitro responsiveness to self-Mls-1a controlled by hemopoietic cells in the thymus. Elimination of potentially self-reactive T lymphocytes during their maturation in the thymus has been shown to be a major mechanism in accomplishing self-tolerance. Previous reports demonstrated that clonal deletion of self-Mls-1a-specific V beta 6+ T lymphocyte is controlled by a radiosensitive I-E+ thymic component. Irradiation chimeras reconstituted with I-E- bone marrow showed substantial numbers of mature V beta 6+ T cells despite host Mls-1a expression. Analysis of the functional properties of such chimeric T cells revealed a surprising variability in their in vitro reactivity to host Mls-1a, depending on the H-2 haplotype of stem cells used for reconstitution. In chimeras reconstituted with B10.S (H-2s) stem cells, mature V beta 6+ lymphocytes were present but functionally anergic to host-type Mls-1a in vitro. In contrast, in chimeras reconstituted with B10.G (H-2q) bone marrow, nondeleted V beta 6+ cells were highly responsive to Mls-1a in vitro. These findings suggest that clonal anergy of V beta 6+ cells to self-Mls-1a may be controlled by the affinity/avidity of T cell receptor interactions with bone marrow-derived cells in the thymus depending on the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules involved. Furthermore, chimeras bearing host (Mls-1a)-reactive V beta 6+ cells did not differ clinically from those with anergic or deleted V beta 6+ cells and survived more than one year without signs of autoimmune disease. Interestingly, their spleen cells had no Mls-1a stimulatory capacity in vitro. Therefore, regulation at the level of antigen presentation may be an alternative mechanism for maintenance of tolerance to certain self-antigens such as Mls-1a.
3 Functional subclasses of T lymphocytes bearing different Ly antigens. II. Cooperation between subclasses of Ly+ cells in the generation of killer activity. Lymphocytes from BALB/c or C57B6/6 mice that develop killer activity to alloantigens belong to the numerically small Ly-23 subclass of peripheral T cells, distinguished by selective expression of Ly-23 determinants on their surfaces. The maturation of these cells to killer cells can be amplified by Ly-1+ cells, which do not themselves contribute to the killer cell pool. This amplification was abolished by escluding Ia("Beta")+ cells from the stimulator population during mixed lymphocyte culture (MCL), suggesting that amplification is due to selective recognition of I region antigens by L-1+ cells, a conclusion already drawn from our previous evidence that Ia differences activate Ly-1+ cells but not Ly-23+ cells. These and other experiments indicate that amplification of killer cell production in vitro by Ly-1+ cells is not due to their conversion to Ly-23+ cells during MLC, but to their ability to recognize major histocompatibility complex determinants not recognized by Ly-23+ cells.
3 IR gene regulation of the response to trinitrophenyl-polysaccharides. Two independent genes are required for antibody production. The primary in vitro antibody response to TNP-Ficoll was found to be under H-2-restricted Ir gene control. Strains B10(H-2b), B10.A(H-2a), and B10.S(9R) (H-2t4) were consistently low responders while strains D2.GD(H-2g2), B10.GD(H-2g2), and B10.S(H-2s) were high responders. The in vitro TNP-Ficoll response in congenic recombinant and F1 hybrid mice demonstrated the requirement for complementation of two independent Ir genes. One Ir gene mapped in or to the left of the I-A subregion with high responder alleles being s or d. The second Ir gene mapped to the right of the I-E subregion and required b or s alleles for complementation. These results were further supported by the ability to block the TNP-Ficoll response by appropriate anti-Ia serum pretreatment of the antigen-presenting macrophages. When a structurally different polysaccharide antigen TNP-dextran was used, an identical pattern of restriction was observed.
3 Induction of specific nonresponsiveness in unprimed human T cells by anti-CD3 antibody and alloantigen. Fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to alloantigen for 3-8 d in the presence of anti-CD3 antibodies showed no response after restimulation with cells from the original donor but remained capable of responding to third-party donors. Antigen-specific nonresponsiveness was induced by both nonmitogenic and mitogenic anti-CD3 antibodies but not by antibodies against CD2, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD18, or CD28. Nonresponsiveness induced by anti-CD3 antibody in mixed leukocyte culture was sustained for at least 34 d from initiation of the culture and 26 d after removal of the antibody. Anti-CD3 antibody also induced antigen-specific nonresponsiveness in cytotoxic T cell generation assays. Anti-CD3 antibody did not induce nonresponsiveness in previously primed cells. Nonresponsiveness induced by anti-CD3 did not appear to be associated with suppressor cell activation. Thus, co-stimulation of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex on unprimed T cells with a fluid phase anti-CD3 antibody and allogenic major histocompatibility complex antigens can induce either clonal anergy or clonal deletion. These results suggest novel approaches for achieving transplantation tolerance.
3 Evolutionary conservation of major histocompatibility complex-DR/peptide/T cell interactions in primates. Many major histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphisms originate from ancient structures that predate speciation. As a consequence, members of the Mhc-DRB1*03 allelic lineage are not only present in humans but in chimpanzees and rhesus macaques as well. This emphasizes that Mhc-DRB1*03 members must have been present in a common ancestor of these primate species that lived about 30 million years ago. Due to the accumulation of genetic variation, however, alleles of the Mhc-DRB1*03 lineage exhibit species-unique sequences. To investigate the biological importance of such conservation and variation, we have studied both the binding and antigen presentation capacity of various trans-species Mhc-DRB1*03 lineage members. Here we show that p3-13 of the 65-kD heat-shock protein (hsp65) of Mycobacterium leprae and M. tuberculosis binds not only to HLA-DR17(3) but also to some chimpanzee and rhesus macaque class II-positive cells. Comparison of the corresponding human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque Mhc-DRB1*03 lineage members revealed the presence of uniquely shared amino acid residues, at positions 9-13 and 26-31, of the antigen-binding site that are critical for p3-13 binding. In addition it is shown that several nonhuman primate antigen-presenting cells that bind p3-13 can activate HLA-DR17-restricted T cells. Certain amino acid replacements, however, in Mhc-DRB1*03 lineage members did not influence peptide binding or T cell recognition. Therefore, these studies demonstrate that some polymorphic amino acid residues (motifs) within the antigen-binding site of MHC class II molecules that are crucial for peptide binding and recognition by the T cell receptor have been conserved for over 30 million years.
0 In vitro induction of T-lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity by infectious murine type C oncornaviruses. We have developed a system to induce oncornavirus-specific secondary cytotoxic response in vitro. When Moloney strain of murine sarcoma virus-immune spleen cells were cultivated with purified infectious Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) or with supernates of tissue culture cells containing infectious virus, a virus-specific secondary cytotoxic response directed against type-specific determinant(s) of M-MuLV was generated in vitro, as determined by a 4-h 51Cr-release assay. The effector cells were susceptible to the treatment with anti-Thyl.2 plus complement, but were unrelated to natural killer cells (NK), because they could not lyse some target cells specific for M-MuLV in both the induction phase and the interaction between effector cells and target cells. Furthermore, a product of the env gene of M-MuLV, perhaps gp70, appeared to be responsible for this response, because viruses with recombinations in the env gene between ecotropic M-MuLV and a xenotropic virus failed to induce a response. When infectious M-MuLV was exposed to UV-light at different doses, the ability of UV-treated M-MuLV to induce a secondary cytotoxic response decreased in parallel with infectivity, indicating that infectivity was necessary for the induction of this response.
3 Age-related changes in cell surface antigens of preleukemic AKR thymocytes. Thymocytes from preleukemic AKR mice aged 5-6 mo have an altered pattern of cell surface antigens. The expression of four MuLV-related antigens on the cell surface (GIX, GCSA, gp70, p30) is markedly increased in comparison to 2-mo-old AKR mice and approximates the heightened levels of these antigens found on thymic leukemia cells. H-2 and Thy-1 alloantigens also show characteristic modifications in relation to age and leukemia development. In contrast to the high Thy-1/low H-2 levels on 2-mo-old AKR thymocytes, thymocytes from 6-mo-old mice and thymic leukemia cells frequently show a low Thy-1/high H-2 surface phenotype. As thymocytes from mouse strains with a low incidence of leukemia do not show these changes, they appear to represent a stage in the conversion of normal cells to leukemia cells.
3 Cyclical changes in seroprevalence of leptospirosis in California sea lions: endemic and epidemic disease in one host species? Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease infecting a broad range of mammalian hosts, and is re-emerging globally. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) have experienced recurrent outbreaks of leptospirosis since 1970, but it is unknown whether the pathogen persists in the sea lion population or is introduced repeatedly from external reservoirs. We analyzed serum samples collected over an 11-year period from 1344 California sea lions that stranded alive on the California coast, using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for antibodies to Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona. We evaluated seroprevalence among yearlings as a measure of incidence in the population, and characterized antibody persistence times based on temporal changes in the distribution of titer scores. We conducted multinomial logistic regression to determine individual risk factors for seropositivity with high and low titers. The serosurvey revealed cyclical patterns in seroprevalence to L. interrogans serovar Pomona, with 4-5 year periodicity and peak seroprevalence above 50%. Seroprevalence in yearling sea lions was an accurate index of exposure among all age classses, and indicated on-going exposure to leptospires in non-outbreak years. Analysis of titer decay rates showed that some individuals probably maintain high titers for more than a year following exposure. This study presents results of an unprecedented long-term serosurveillance program in marine mammals. Our results suggest that leptospirosis is endemic in California sea lions, but also causes periodic epidemics of acute disease. The findings call into question the classical dichotomy between maintenance hosts of leptospirosis, which experience chronic but largely asymptomatic infections, and accidental hosts, which suffer acute illness or death as a result of disease spillover from reservoir species.
2 T cell dysfunction in the diabetes-prone BB rat. A role for thymic migrants that are not T cell precursors. Diabetes-prone BB (BB-DP) rats express several T cell dysfunctions which include poor proliferative and cytotoxic responses to alloantigen. The goal of this study was to determine the origin of these T cell dysfunctions. When BB-DP rats were thymectomized, T cell depleted, and transplanted with neonatal thymus tissue from diabetes-resistant and otherwise normal DA/BB F1 rats, the early restoration of T cell function proceeded normally on a cell-for-cell basis; i.e., peripheral T cells functioned like those from the thymus donor. Because the thymus in these experiments was subjected to gamma irradiation before transplantation and there was no evidence of F1 chimerism in the transplanted BB-DP rats, it appeared that the BB-DP T cell precursors could mature into normally functioning T cells if the maturation process occurred in a normal thymus. If the F1 thymus tissue was treated with dGua before transplantation, the T cells of these animals functioned poorly like those from untreated BB-DP rats. dGua poisons bone marrow-derived cells, including gamma radiation-resistant cells of the macrophage/dendritic cell lineages, while sparing the thymic epithelium. Therefore, the reversal of the T cell dysfunction depends on the presence in the F1 thymus of gamma radiation-resistant, dGua-sensitive F1 cells. Conversely, thymectomized and T cell-depleted F1 rats expressed T cell dysfunction when transplanted with gamma-irradiated BB thymus grafts. T cell responses were normal in animals transplanted with dGua-treated BB thymus grafts. With increasing time after thymus transplantation, T cells from all animals gradually expressed the functional phenotype of the bone marrow donor. Taken together these results suggest that BB-DP bone marrow-derived cells that are not T cell precursors influence the maturation environment in the thymus of otherwise normal BB-DP T cell precursors.
2 Induction of IgG in young nude mice by lipid A or thymus grafts. Postnatal serum concentrations of IgG2a of paternal allotype, measured in congenitally thymusless nude mice, increase with kinetics and titers comparable to their normal congeneic counterparts. Lipid A, the mitogenic part of LPS, stimulates IgG synthesis in nude mice when it is given 7 days after birth. IgG concentrations at 15 days of age are 6- to 8-fold higher than in untreated control nudes; this is considerably lower, however, than in normal mice, which show up to 45-fold higher IgG2ab levels after lipid A treatment. A thymus graft from nearly congeneic donors of the same age, transplanted at 4 days after birth, also stimulates long-lasting IgG synthesis in the nude recipients. If the grafted nudes are injected with lipid A 3 days later, IgG synthesis is further stimulated 8- to 16-fold. The data are discussed in relation to the thymus dependency of IgG production and the conditions for lipid A stimulation.
3 Release of endogenous pyrogen-activating factor from concanavalin A-stimulated human lymphocytes. Evidence is presented that the mitogen concanavalin A stimulates human lymphocytes to produce a nonpyrogenic lymphokine (LK) that is capable of activating human monocytes but not granulocytes to produce endogenous pyrogen (EP) in vitro. The potency of this preparation should facilitate further studies to purify and characterize this agent and determine its relation to other know LK. It seems likely that this factor, which we have called EP-activating factor (EPAF), plays a significant role in the development of fever in states of delayed hypersensitivity in man.
3 Identification of viral molecules recognized by influenza-specific human cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Human cytotoxic T cells specific for influenza A virus were tested for recognition of each of the ten influenza A virus proteins expressed in target cells using recombinant vaccinia viruses. They recognized the matrix M1, polymerase PB2, and nucleoproteins of influenza virus in association with MHC class I antigens. These internal viral proteins were seen by CTL in conjunction with one or more of the available dependent HLA gene products. There was no detectable recognition of influenza virus surface glycoproteins in target cells.
3 Activation and desensitization of platelets by platelet-activating factor (PAF) derived from IgE-sensitized basophils. I. Characteristics of the secretory response. The secretion of vasoactive amines from rabbit platelets induced by the platelet-activating factor (PAF) derived from IgE-sensitized rabbit basophils, was examined. The secretion required calcium has previously been shown to be noncytotoxic and was optimal in both rate and extent at 37 degrees C and pH 7.2. Different temperature-sensitive steps were rate limiting for secretion above or below 20 degrees C. The rate of secretion was dependent upon the concentration of PAF and also of platelets. Maximal rates were observed with relatively low concentrations of platelets (2.5 X 10(8)/ml), sharply contrasting with other platelet stimuli such as C3 or thrombin. The extent of secretion was dependent upon PAF concentration until a maximum of 50 or 60% of the serotonin was released and then declined with increasing amounts of PAF. This was interpreted to result from the platelets becoming desensitized to the PAF, a process that shuts off the secretion. Such a desensitization was demonstrated and was shown to be stimulus specific, i.e., other stimuli could still induce secretion from PAF-desensitized platelets. PAF extracted with ethanol from the albumin to which it is usually bound during preparation, exhibited similar characteristics, except that secretion of up to 90% of the serotonin was induced. The extracted PAF thus seemed less able to induce the desensitization. Its use did provide important evidence that populations of rabbit platelets are relatively homogenous in their ability to respond to PAF.
1 The human mannose-binding protein gene. Exon structure reveals its evolutionary relationship to a human pulmonary surfactant gene and localization to chromosome 10. The human mannose-binding protein (MBP) plays a role in first line host defense against certain pathogens. It is an acute phase protein that exists in serum as a multimer of a 32-kD subunit. The NH2 terminus is rich in cysteines that mediate interchain disulphide bonds and stabilize the second collagen-like region. This is followed by a short intervening region, and the carbohydrate recognition domain is found in the COOH-terminal region. Analysis of the human MBP gene reveals that the coding region is interrupted by three introns, and all four exons appear to encode a distinct domain of the protein. It appears that the human MBP gene has evolved by recombination of an ancestral nonfibrillar collagen gene with a gene that encodes carbohydrate recognition, and is therefore similar to the human surfactant SP-A gene and the rat MBP gene. The gene for MBP is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 at 10q11.2-q21, a region that is included in the assignment for the gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A.
3 The functional relationship of the interleukins. The mechanism of the lymphoproliferative effect of the macrophage product lymphocyte-activating factor [LAF(IL1] appears to be mediated by the stimulation of the release of T cell growth factor [TCGF(IL2)] by T cells. The magnitude of the resultant T cell proliferative clonal expansion is thus dependent upon the quantity of both LAF(IL1) and TCGF(IL2) induced by antigen or lectin stimulation. These observations, coupled with the ability to measure the production and actions of these hormone-like lymphokines, should allow for increased insight into the mode of action of immunoenhancing and immunosuppressive agents, as well as for new therapeutic approaches to disease states involving T lymphocytes.
3 The cortical protein Num1p is essential for dynein-dependent interactions of microtubules with the cortex. In budding yeast, the mitotic spindle moves into the neck between the mother and bud via dynein-dependent sliding of cytoplasmic microtubules along the cortex of the bud. How dynein and microtubules interact with the cortex is unknown. We found that cells lacking Num1p failed to exhibit dynein-dependent microtubule sliding in the bud, resulting in defective mitotic spindle movement and nuclear segregation. Num1p localized to the bud cortex, and that localization was independent of microtubules, dynein, or dynactin. These data are consistent with Num1p being an essential element of the cortical attachment mechanism for dynein-dependent sliding of microtubules in the bud.
2 Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis mediated by cartilage. Capillary proliferation induced by tumor is shown to be inhibited by neonatal scapular cartilage. Using the rabbit cornea as an assay, the cartilage implant decreased the rate of capillary growth, induced by tumor, by an average of 75%. Vascularization was prevented completely in 28% of tumors. The inhibitory effect of small cartilage implants operates over distances of up to 2.0 mm and displays a gradient from the cartilage source. The experiments suggest that the cartilage inhibitor does not antagonize tumor angiogenesis factor, but appears to inhibit capillary proliferation directly. The inhibitory material does not elicit an inflammatory response in either the rabbit cornea or in the chick chorioallantoic membrane. Thus with further purification, it may prove useful as a means of maintining tumor dormancy by "antiangiogenesis."
3 Characterization of a membrane pore-forming protein from Entamoeba histolytica. We describe the partial purification and characterization of a pore-forming material (PEM) from Entamoeba histolytica. The formation of ion channels by PFM was examined in three systems. (a) PFM depolarizes J774 macrophages and mouse spleen lymphocytes as measured by [3H]TPP+ uptake. (b) PFM induces rapid monovalent cation flux across the membrane of phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol vesicles. (c) PFM confers a voltage-dependent conductance to artificial planar bilayers, which is resolved as a summation of opening of individually conducting steps of 67 pS in 0.1 M KCl. Monomers of PFM are functional; however, a preferential aggregation occurs in the planar bilayer. Activity is pronase, trypsin, and heat sensitive and is stable between pH 5-8. PFM is not secreted by unstimulated amoebae but after exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187, concanavalin A, and E. coli lipopolysaccharide, 5-10% of the total cell content of PFM is released into the medium within 5-10 min. High-performance gel filtration results in an approximately 1,000-fold purification of PFM and gives an Mr of 30,000. This protein may play a role in the cytotoxicity mediated by E. histolytica.
3 Freezing adhesion molecules in a state of high-avidity binding blocks eosinophil migration. Leukocyte extravasation is mediated by multiple interactions of adhesive surface structures with ligands on endothelial cells and matrix components. The functional role of beta 1 (CD29) integrins (or very late antigen [VLA] proteins) in eosinophil migration across polycarbonate filters was examined under several in vitro conditions. Eosinophil migration induced by the chemoattractant C5a or platelet-activating factor was fully inhibited by monoclonal antibody (mAb) 8A2, a recently characterized "activating" CD29 mAb. However, inhibition by mAb 8A2 was observed only under filter conditions that best reflected the in vivo situation, i.e., when the eosinophils migrated over filters preincubated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibronectin (FN), or when the filters were covered with confluent monolayers of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). When bare untreated filters were used, mAb 8A2 had no effect, whereas the C5a-directed movement was prevented by CD18 mAb. Studies with alpha-subunit (CD49)-specific mAbs indicated that the integrins VLA-4 and -5 mediated migration across FN-preincubated filters, and VLA-2, -4, -5, and -6 were involved in eosinophil migration through filters covered with HUVEC. In contrast with the activating CD29 mAb 8A2, a combination of blocking CD49 mAbs or the nonactivating but blocking CD29 mAb AIIB2 failed to inhibit completely eosinophil migration over FN-preincubated or HUVEC-covered filters. mAb 8A2 stimulated binding to FN but not to HUVEC. Moreover, eosinophil migration over FN-preincubated or HUVEC-covered filters was significantly inhibited by anti-connecting segment 1 (CS-1) mAbs, as well as the soluble CS-1 peptide (unlike migration across bare untreated filters). Thus, inhibition of eosinophil migration by mAb 8A2 depended upon the presence of ECM proteins and not upon the presence of HUVEC per se. In conclusion, "freezing" adhesion receptors of the beta 1 integrin family into their high-avidity binding state by the activating CD29 mAb 8A2 results in a complete inhibition of eosinophil migration under physiological conditions. Hence, activation of beta 1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion may represent a new approach to prevent influx of inflammatory cells.
3 Fever and immunoregulation. III. Hyperthermia augments the primary in vitro humoral immune response. We have examined the possibility that hyperthermia, such as that occurring during fever, may benefit the immune response. The effect of temperature on the in vitro immune response of unprimed murine spleen cells against the antigen sheep erythrocytes was tested. Hyperthermia potently augmented the plaque-forming cell response. Temperature-sensitive events occurred early in the culture period. Subsets of lymphocytes were independently assessed for effects of temperature on their activation and function. We showed that the beneficial effect of elevated temperature on the plaque-forming cell response probably occurs during the priming stage of T helper cells, and neither improves the delivery of help or the activation of B cells, nor impairs suppressor T cell generation or function. We propose that this powerful immunopotentiating effect of hyperthermia may account for the selective value of the fever response. This suggests taht the monokine interleukin 1, which is the endogenous mediator of fever, may promote immune responses both through a direct action on lymphocytes, and indirectly by an action on the central nervous system resulting in fever.
3 Analysis of the response of B cells from CBA/N-defective mice to nonspecific T cell help. We have investigated the induction of antibody responses to erythrocyte (RBC)-bound antigens in the (CBA/N x B10)F1 mouse. Male B cells, which express the CBA/N defect, were shown to be unresponsive to RBC antigens when the delivered T cell helper activity was solely nonspecific. Thus we demonstrated that defective B cells did not respond to concanavalin A supernatants or bystander helper activity, in spite of the fact that CBA/N-defective mice could produce these T cell activities. The defective B cell did not respond to RBC-bound antigen in the presence of RBC-primed T cells, although the magnitude of this response was usually twofold less than normal controls. The insensitivity of CBA/N defective B cells to nonspecific T cell helper activities seemed to involve at least the inability of RBC antigens to activate defective B cells in the absence of antigen-specific T cell help.
3 Interleukin 4 causes isotype switching to IgE in T cell-stimulated clonal B cell cultures. Although it has been established that IL-4 enhances both IgG1 and IgE secretion in LPS-stimulated B cell cultures, these studies failed to determine whether IL-4 preferentially induces isotype switching or preferentially allows for the maturation of precommitted precursor cells. To distinguish between these possibilities, it is necessary to ascertain the effect of IL-4 on the isotypes secreted by individual precursor cells during clonal expansion. Therefore, clonal cultures of B cells stimulated with a Th2 helper cell line specific for rabbit Ig and rabbit anti-mouse IgM were established. The majority of B cells are capable of undergoing clonal expansion under these conditions. To vary the level of IL-4 present, either IL-4 or anti-IL-4 was added to cultures. In the presence of IL-4 there was an increase in the proportion of clones that secreted IgE and a decrease in the proportion of clones that secreted IgM. The addition of IL-4 to cultures also increased the amount of IgE secreted by individual clones. Thus, these experiments definitively prove that IL-4 causes specific heavy chain class switching to IgE in Th2-stimulated B cell cultures. In contrast, IL-4 does not affect the proportion of clones secreting IgG1, suggesting that other consequences of Th cell-B cell interactions play a role in the generation of an IgG1 response.
3 Interleukin 3 perfusion prevents death due to acute anemia induced by monoclonal antierythrocyte autoantibody. We have evaluated the therapeutic activity of rIL-3, in comparison with recombinant granulocyte-macrophage CSF (rGM-CSF) and recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo), on a lethal form of acute anemia induced by a single injection of a monoclonal IgG1 anti-mouse RBC (MRBC) autoantibody. Continuous perfusion of rIL-3 before the administration of anti-MRBC mAb prevented animals from the death due to anemia with a rapid recovery in greater than 90% of the cases, while only partial protection (one third of the cases) was obtained by rEpo perfusion, and no protection by rGM-CSF. Since the anti-MRBC mAb induced a marked agglutination of RBC in spleens and livers, and subsequent hemodynamic failure may be an additional contributing factor to the animals' death, the activation of Fc gamma receptor-dependent phagocytosis by rIL-3, as well as the increased number of monocytes/macrophages resulting from rIL-3 perfusion, may also facilitate rapid elimination of these agglutinated RBC, resulting in the further amelioration of the animals' survival. Our results suggest that the therapeutic effect of rIL-3 on anti-MRBC autoantibody-induced anemia is achieved by: (a) its activity to promote the growth and differentiation of erythroid progenitors responsive to Epo and of monocyte/macrophage lineage; and (b) its activity to enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages to efficiently eliminate agglutinated RBC in spleens and livers.
3 Multiple activities of a cloned cell line mediating natural killer cell function. A special class of immunologic cells can lyse or damage a variety of target cells, notably malignant cells in vitro. These cells have been called natural killer (NK) cells because lysis does not require deliberate immunization by tumor cells. Although these cells can be distinguished from conventional T cells, B cells, and phagocytic cells, they have been difficult to define. We describe a representative cloned cell line that was obtained by cloning Ig -Ly-5+ cells from spleen. This clone, Cl.Ly-1-2-NK-1+/11, displays Thy-1, Ly-5, Qat-4, Qat-5 and NK-1 cell surface antigens and lyses the NK-sensitive YAC-1 lymphoma cells, but does not lyse RL-12 cells, an NK-resistant lymphoma. In addition, this clone lysed the P815 mastocytoma, EL4 lymphoma, and lipopolysaccharide-activated B lymphocyte targets. This cloned population therefore combined information for a unique display of cell surface antigens and specialized function similar to "activated" NK cells. Because this cloned population forms conjugates with susceptible but not resistant target cells, it may prove useful to identify the structure of cell surface molecules that recognize foreign cells. Finally, cells of this clone also specificity lysed target cells coated by antibodies to determinants on the target cell surface, demonstrating that a single cloned cell population can mediate two specialized immunologic functions: antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and NK cell lysis.
3 TGF-beta/Smad3 signals repress chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation and are required for maintaining articular cartilage. Endochondral ossification begins from the condensation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells into cartilage. The cartilage then goes through a program of cell proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation, calcification, apoptosis, and eventually is replaced by bone. Unlike most cartilage, articular cartilage is arrested before terminal hypertrophic differentiation. In this study, we showed that TGF-beta/Smad3 signals inhibit terminal hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocyte and are essential for maintaining articular cartilage. Mutant mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of Smad3 exon 8 (Smad3(ex8/ex8)) developed degenerative joint disease resembling human osteoarthritis, as characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage, formation of large osteophytes, decreased production of proteoglycans, and abnormally increased number of type X collagen-expressing chondrocytes in synovial joints. Enhanced terminal differentiation of epiphyseal growth plate chondrocytes was also observed in mutant mice shortly after weaning. In an in vitro embryonic metatarsal rudiment culture system, we found that TGF-beta1 significantly inhibits chondrocyte differentiation of wild-type metatarsal rudiments. However, this inhibition is diminished in metatarsal bones isolated from Smad3(ex8/ex8) mice. These data suggest that TGF-beta/Smad3 signals are essential for repressing articular chondrocyte differentiation. Without these inhibition signals, chondrocytes break quiescent state and undergo abnormal terminal differentiation, ultimately leading to osteoarthritis.
0 Detection of alloantigens during preimplantation development and early trophoblast differentiation in the mouse by immunoperoxidase labeling. An immunoperoxidase-labeling technique allowing visualization of antibody binding to the cell surface at the electron microscopical level has been employed an an analysis of H-2 and non-H-2 alloantigen expression on the early mouse embryo. The presence of non-H-2 antigenic determinants has been confirmed on eight-cell, morula, and blastocyst stages of development. Contrary to previous reports, however, low levels of H-2 antigen have also been detected on the blastocyst. This is the earliest stage at which H-2 has been shown to be expressed on the fertilized mouse egg and may reflect the greater resolution of the immunoperoxidase technique. Using two different models to study the critical peri-implantation stages, those of experimentally induced blastocyst activation and blastocyst outgrowth in vitro, it has been demonstrated that antigen loss occurs on the trophectoderm at the time of implantation, and that this is not necessarily dependent upon maternal influence. It is suggested that the loss may be an important factor in the prevention of maternal immune rejection during the establishment of the fetal allograft. The two major components of the early postimplantation conceptus display a striking differential in antigenic status. The embryonic sac shows a high degree of peroxidase labeling, while the ectoplacental cone trophoblast is unlabeled. These findings add support to the concept of antigenic neutrality of the early trophoblast and its role in the maintenance of a normal fetomaternal immunological equilibrium.
3 Induction of Ia antigen in rat epidermal cells and gut epithelium by immunological stimuli. The expression of Ia antigen in rat keratinocytes and gut epithelium was found to be inducible by a variety of immunological stimuli. Graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) was accompanied by the appearance of Ia antigen in both sites, whereas local immunological stimuli, such as a contact-sensitizing agent applied to the skin and Trichinella spiralis infection of the gut, caused the expression of Ia antigen confined to the sites of contact of these stimuli with the tissues involved. Both T helper and T cytotoxic/suppressor subsets of parental lymphocytes, used to produce GvHD in F1 hybrid recipients, induce Ia expression in the skin and gut of these hosts, but simultaneous removal of both subsets from the donor inocula prevented induction. The Ia antigen expression associated with GvHD was shown to be of host origin but was not acquired from bone marrow-derived cells. Attempts to detect Ia antigen in serum or lymph of rats with GvHD gave negative results, and it was shown that Ia+ cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine did not take up detectable amounts of Ia antigen from the Ia+ intestinal epithelium. It appears that the local recognition of antigen by T lymphocytes can result in the induction of Ia antigen in keratinocytes and in the epithelial cells of the intestine. This antigen is synthesized by the cells in which it is found, and the observation that immunological stimuli are responsible for its appearance suggests that its role is an immunological one. Failure to find evidence that the gut epithelium Ia antigen was transferred to lymph or taken up by other Ia+ cells in the intestinal villi supports the view that this Ia (and, by analogy, that found in keratinocytes) serves a local function, and the possibility that it is involved in antigen presentation to T cells is discussed.
3 A novel surface antigen expressed by a subset of human CD3- CD16+ natural killer cells. Role in cell activation and regulation of cytolytic function. The GL183 mAb was obtained by immunizing BALB/c mice with the E57 clone (CD7+CD2+CD3-CD16+CD56+) derived from human peripheral blood NK cells. In human peripheral blood, GL183-reactive cells ranged between 2 and 12% (mean 6.5%) in 10 different donors. Double fluorescence and FACS analysis showed that GL183+ cells were consistently included in the CD56+ or CD16+ cell populations. Moreover, since only a fraction of CD56+ or CD16+ cells (approximately 40%) coexpressed GL183 surface antigen, reactivity with GL183 mAb appears to define two subsets within the CD3- lymphocyte population expressing NK cell markers. Although, the majority of GL183+ cells were CD3-, approximately 1% expressed CD3 surface antigens. As shown by clonal analysis, these infrequent CD3+GL183+ cells coexpressed CD56 and CD16 antigens. Cloning of CD3-GL183+ or CD3-GL183- cell populations under limiting dilution conditions yielded clonal progenies that maintained their original surface phenotype. Therefore, expression or lack of expression of GL183 surface antigens represents a stable phenotypic property of a subset of human CD3- NK cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments and two-dimensional PAGE analysis indicated that GL183-reactive molecules were represented in different clones either by a single 58-kD chain or, more frequently, by two chains of approximately 55 and approximately 58 kD, respectively. Analysis of GL183+ or GL183- NK clones for their ability to lyse human (IGROV I) or murine (P815) tumor target cells indicated that GL183- clones were, on average, fivefold more efficient in inducing target cell lysis. GL183+ and GL183- clones produced comparable levels of TNF-alpha in response to PHA plus PMA or anti-CD16 mAb plus PMA. Importantly, production of TNF-alpha was also induced by stimulation of GL183+ clones with GL183 mAb plus PMA. These data indicated that GL183 antigen could mediate cell triggering. This concept was confirmed by the analysis of Ca2+ mobilization, as GL183 mAb induced (in GL183+ clones) increments of [Ca2+]i comparable with those induced by PHA. Moreover, GL183 mAb, or its F(ab')2 fragments, strongly enhanced the cytolytic activity of GL183+ clones against a panel of human tumor target cells, including U937, Raji, IGROV I, M14, and A549. In contrast, GL183 mAb, but not the F(ab')2 fragments, sharply inhibited the cytolytic activity of the same clones against P815, M12, and P3U1 murine target cells. In this case, the effect of GL183 mAb (inhibition) was opposite that of PHA or of stimulatory anti-CD2 or anti-CD16 mAbs, which consistently enhanced the target cell lysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3 J chain biosynthesis in pre-B cells and other possible precursor B cells. Human cell lines that resemble precursors in the B cell lineage have been found to synthesize J chain. In vivo pulse labeling, together with in vitro translation of total cellular RNA in a wheat germ cell-free system, detected the synthesis of J chain in immunoglobulin-secreting cell lines, in a cell line with only surface IgM, as well as in the pre-B-like cell line Josh 4 and the round cell lines Josh 7 and KLM 2. The primary translation products of J chain from all of these cell lines were found to be indistinguishable from one another by serologic criteria, by relative mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, by charge as judged by alkaline-urea gel electrophoresis, and by peptide mapping. These findings suggest that the onset of J chain biosynthesis represents a relatively early event in B cell ontogeny, occurring before the development of immunoglobulin polymer-secreting cells. Its role may, consequently, be fundamental to the biosynthesis of all immunoglobulins, at different stages of B cell differentiation.
1 Molecular basis for a polymorphism of human Fc gamma receptor II (CD32). The IgG Fc receptor II on human monocytes is polymorphic in its ability to bind mIgG1, and its isoelectric focusing pattern. To study the molecular basis of this polymorphism, a cDNA library from cell line K562, expressing two different allelic forms (high responder [HR] and low responder [LR]) of Fc gamma RII, was used for cDNA cloning. We report the isolation and identification of different Fc gamma RII cDNA clones, comprising the LR form of Fc gamma RII, as was evident from studies using a new HR-specific anti-Fc gamma RII mAb 41H16, and from rosetting experiments. Sequence analysis revealed that HR and LR forms differ by two amino acids, both located in the external domain. In the cloned LR form, a glutamine is substituted by a tryptophan residue at aa position 27, located in the first Ig-like domain, and an arginine residue by a histidine residue at aa position 131 in the second Ig-like domain. Furthermore, an Fc gamma RII cDNA clone was isolated with a deletion of 123 bp, overlapping the predicted transmembrane segment. Data showing the presence of an alternatively spliced mRNA detected by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) might suggest the existence of a soluble form of the human Fc gamma RII, in addition to the membrane-bound forms.
3 The receptor specificity of alloreactive T cells. Distinction between stimulator K, I, and D region products and degeneracy of third-party H-2 recognition by low-affinity T cells. The specificity of binding of stimulator-derived H-2 antigens by mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC)-activated T blasts was investigated under conditions of antigen excess. We have shown that the detectable proportion of alloantigen-binding blasts from primary MLC is a function of antigen concentration, and can represent up to more than 90 percent of total blasts, when the antigen is presented in the appropriate form (on mitomycin-treated viable stimulator cells, or membrane vesicles prepared from lipopolysaccharide blasts), and at nonlimiting concentration. Thus stimulator alloantigen-binding directly parallels the proliferative response and is not restricted to a subpopulation of T blasts. However, the marked dependence of the binding on antigen concentration indicates that cells with a wide range of receptor affinities for the stimulating determinants are involved. In view of this possibility, the specificity of binding by these cells was studied. We have demonstrated that stimulator K, I, and D region products are bound by nonoverlapping subpopulations of blasts, the sum of which may represent 93 percent of total blasts. Thus, specific distinction by these cells between different H-2 region products is not affected by the putative heterogeneity in terms of receptor affinities. However, specificity with respect to unrelated H-2 haplotypes is strictly dependent on antigen concentration. A preferential binding of stimulator membrane vesicles occurs at limiting concentrations; whereas the majority of blasts bind stimulator and third- party vesicles equally well at high vesicle concentrations. The binding of both vesicle types is specific in that it can be inhibited with the relevant anti-H-2 sera. Furthermore, stimulator and third-party vesicles seem to compete for binding sites on the same cells, as shown by cold antigen inhibition. From these results, we propose that there is an imperfect distinction between stimulator and third-party H-2 antigens by the majority of primary MLC blasts. In contrast, highly selected long-term MLC blasts do not bind third-party H-2 antigens at any concentration, and seem to have high affinity for the stimulating antigens. We conclude that large numbers of clones with low-affinity (cross- reactive) receptors are generated in primary MLC, most of which become eliminated during long-term selection. This implies that the frequency of cells strictly specific for nonshared stimulating determinants must be minute.
2 An examination of the temporal and geographical patterns of psychiatric emergency service use by multiple visit patients as a means for their early detection. Frequent users of the psychiatric emergency service (PES) place a heavy burden upon the mental health care delivery system. The aim of this study was to identify distinct temporal or geographical patterns of PES use by these patients as potential markers for their early detection. Diagnostic profiles were obtained for patients making an intermediate (4 to 10) or a high (11 or more) number of visits to a general hospital PES in Montreal (Canada) between 1985 and 2004. Between-group comparisons were made with regards to several parameters. These included the time intervals between consecutive visits, visit clustering (single, repeating, and the time interval to the first cluster) and visits made to three other services where data was similarly acquired from 2002 to 2004. The two multiple visit groups differed with regards to diagnostic profiles and actual time between consecutive visits (significantly shorter in patients with 11 or more visits). Patients with 11 or more visits were more likely to have a single cluster (3 or more visits/3 months) or repeating clusters (4 visits/3 months) in their patterns of use. Personality disorders were more prevalent in patients with single clusters as they were, along with schizophrenia, in those with repeating clusters. In addition, clusters were found to occur sufficiently early so as to be potentially useful as markers for early detection. Ten percent of those with 11 or more visits and 16% of those with an intermediate number of visits frequented at least one other PES. A small number of patients, primarily those with substance abuse, made over 50% of their visits to other services. Temporal and geographical patterns of use differed significantly between the multiple visit groups. These patterns, combined with distinct diagnostic profiles, could potentially lead to the more rapid identification and treatment of specific sub-groups of multiple visit patients.
2 Peptide-specific prevention of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Neonatal tolerance induced to the dominant T cell determinant of myelin basic protein. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a model of antigen-specific T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. The alpha-acetylated, NH2-terminal nine amino acids (1-9NAc) of myelin basic protein (MBP) represents the dominant T cell epitope for the induction of EAE in the B10.PL (H-2u) strain. We tolerized neonatal B10.PL mice to 1-9NAc and studied the proliferative responses to this peptide and to whole MBP. Mice exposed to 1-9NAc in the neonatal period were tolerant to subsequent challenge at the proliferative T cell level. Similarly, in the 1-9NAc-tolerant group, both the incidence and severity of 1-9NAc induced EAE were greatly reduced. The fact that we were able to tolerize mice normally responsive to MBP suggests that this self antigen is sequestered (within the central nervous system) and hence tolerance to it is not normally induced. No significant difference in disease incidence was seen in response to rat MBP between control animals and 1-9NAc-tolerized mice (50% in both groups), demonstrating the presence of at least one additional encephalitogenic determinant elsewhere on the molecule. We have successfully prevented disease induction by peptide-induced tolerization. Tolerance induction by peptides provides a new and specific strategy in the prevention of autoimmunity. However, it will be clearly necessary to fully define all epitopes potentially capable of inducing pathogenic T cells to ensure complete and effective therapy of T cell-mediated autoimmune disease.
3 Polyclonal activation of human peripheral blood B lymphocytes by formaldehyde-fixed Salmonella paratyphi B. I. Immunoglobulin production without DNA synthesis. A "new" polyclonal activator of human peripheral blood B cells, formaldehyde-fixed Salmonella paratyphi B, is described. This bacterium does not stimulate cell proliferation as measured by incorporation of tritiated thymidine but does stimulate a subpopulation of B cells to secrete large amounts of IgM, IgG, and IgA in 7-day cell cultures. The immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by cells responding to S. paratyphi B are not specific antibodies against the bacterial antigens. In comparison with other B cell activators (pokeweed mitogen, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I, and lipopolysaccharide), S. paratyphi B stimulation produced greater amounts of IgM but less IgG than pokeweed mitogen (PWM) or S. aureus Cowan I; lipopolysaccharide failed to stimulate significant Ig production on day 7 in most cases. In addition, the response to S. paratyphi apparently did not require T cell collaboration. These results suggest that the B cell subpopulation(s) responding to S. paratyphi B may be more differentiated B cells than those responding to either PWM or S. aureus Cowan I. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from five patients with common variable immunodeficiency without evidence of abnormal suppressor T cells or monocytes failed to respond to S. paratyphi B, whereas cells from two of the same patients responded well to S. aureus Cowan I and partially to PWM. Thus, S. paratyphi B appears to be superior to other B cell activators for studies of B cell function in normal and abnormal states.
3 Developing health science students into integrated health professionals: a practical tool for learning. An integrated sense of professionalism enables health professionals to draw on relevant knowledge in context and to apply a set of professional responsibilities and ethical principles in the midst of changing work environments 12. Inculcating professionalism is therefore a critical goal of health professional education. Two multi-professional courses for first year Health Science students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa aim to lay the foundation for becoming an integrated health professional 3. In these courses a diagram depicting the domains of the integrated health professional is used to focus the content of small group experiential exercises towards an appreciation of professionalism. The diagram serves as an organising framework for conceptualising an emerging professional identity and for directing learning towards the domains of 'self as professional' 45. This paper describes how a diagrammatic representation of the core elements of an integrated health professional is used as a template for framing course content and for organising student learning. Based on the assumption that all health care professionals should be knowledgeable, empathic and reflective, the diagram provides students and educators with a visual tool for investigating the subjective and objective dimensions of professionalism. The use of the diagram as an integrating point of reference for individual and small group learning is described and substantiated with relevant literature. The authors have applied the diagram with positive impact for the past six years with students and educators reporting that "it just makes sense". The article includes plans for formal evaluation. Evaluation to date is based on preliminary, informal feedback on the value of the diagram as a tool for capturing the domains of professionalism at an early stage in the undergraduate education of health professional students.
2 A regulatory role for the memory B cell as suppressor-inducer of feedback control. A regulatory role is proposed for the antigen-responsive B cell, as suppressor-inducer of feedback control during the secondary response in vivo. In a double adoptive transfer of memory cells primed to a thymus-dependent antigen from one irradiated host to another, antigen-specific suppressors are generated after a critical time in the primary recipient, able to entirely ablate a secondary anti-hapten response. Positive cell selection in the fluorescence-activated cell sorter confirmed that suppression was mediated by an Lyt-2+ T cell; however, positively selected B cells were also inhibitory and able to induce suppressors in a carrier-specific manner: Bhapten induced suppressors in a carrier-primed population, and Bcarrier induced suppressors in a hapten-carrier population. At the peak of the antibody response in the primary host, memory B cells and their progeny were unable to differentiate further to plasma cells due to their intrinsic suppressor-inducer activity, but this autoregulatory circuit could be severed by adoptive transfer to carrier-primed, X-irradiated recipients.
2 Hybrid resistance to EL-4 lymphoma cells. I. Characterization of natural killer cells that lyse EL-4 cells and their distinction from marrow-dependent natural killer cells. Natural killer (NK) cells from nonimmunized mice capable of lysing EL-4 (C57BL/6 strain H-2b) tissue culture-adapted lymphoma cells have been analyzed and compared with NK cells which lyse YAC-1 (A-strain, H-2a) lymphoma cells. A correlation was seen in the ability of inbred and B6D2F1 mice to reject C57BL/6 (B6) bone-marrow grafts and the ability of their spleen cells to lyse EL-4 cells in vitro. This suggests that hybrid or hemopoietic histocompatibility antigens, (Hh-1b), relevant in the rejection of B6 stem cells may also be the relevant target structures for the anti-EL-4 NK cells. Certain features of these NK cells are similar to the NK cells reactive against YAC-1 cells. Both types of NK cells are present in athymic nude mice, are not affected by treatment with anti-immunoglobulin plus complement, and are not depleted by techniques that remove macrophages. NK activity against both targets is stimulated 3 d after injection of Corynebacterium parvum, and 24 h after challenge with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid. Hydrocortisone acetate and cyclophosphamide lead to reduction of NK activity within 2-3 d after administration. However, the anti-YAC and anti-EL-4 NK reactivities differed in several important respects. Treatment of mice with 89Sr, the bone-seeking isotope, to deplete marrow-dependent cells, depleted the anti-YAC-1 but not anti-EL-4 cell functions. Anti-EL-4 NK cells were unaffected by silica particles in vivo or in vitro; the NK cells reactive to EL-4 cells matured functionally much earlier in life (5 d of age) and the function did not decline with age. Irradiated mice reconstituted with syngeneic marrow or spleen cells developed functional NK cells against EL-4 targets before they developed anti-YAC-1 NK cells in their spleen. Thus anti-EL-4 NK cells that express hybrid resistance in vitro appear to differ from anti-YAC-1 NK cells and do not require an intact marrow microenvironment for functional differentiation. Despite differences in the NK-cell types involved in the lysis of YAC-1 and EL-4 cells, these two tumor cells share certain common determinants. This was ascertained both by cold competition and by utilization of YAC-1 and EL-4 cell monolayers as immunoadsorbents. We conclude that Hh-1b is the common antigen present in EL-4 and YAC-1 cells, because B6D2F1 anti-B6 (anti-Hh-1b) cytotoxic T lymphocytes lysed both the tumor cells. Our data suggest that Hh-1b antigen is recognized by both types of NK cells, but that additional determinants must be present on YAC-1 cells. Two models of NK cell lysis compatible with the data are presented.
2 Synthesis and degradation of ribosomal RNA in regenerating liver. A simple double-isotope method is described which permits precise determination of both synthetic and degradative rates of liver cell constituents during the course of regeneration after partial hepatectomy. By employing animals which have previously received both tritiated thymidine and an appropriate 14C-labeled precursor it is possible to obtain precise turnover data in individual animals by comparing the concentration and the total isotope content of the 14C-labeled component in the initially excised and regenerating portions of liver. The presence of a 3H marker in the liver DNA makes it possible in addition to calculate the exact size of the initial liver remnant and hence to interpret the observed 14C turnover data in terms of specific rates of synthesis and degradation. As an illustration of its usefulness this method has been employed to study changes in cell proliferation rate after partial hepatectomy, and to determine the day-to-day rates of synthesis and degradation of ribosomal RNA, the major component of rat liver RNA. It is shown that during the first 24 h after a 70% hepatectomy ribosomal RNA synthesis undergoes a nearly fourfold stimulation to a rate of approximately 53% per unit mass per day. This accelerated rate of synthesis is sustained for an additional 2 days and is accompanied by exponential DNA synthesis until the hepatic remnant has more than tripled its initial DNA and ribosomal RNA content to attain values identical to those in the initial intact liver; the rates of DNA and RNA synthesis then fall abruptly. In striking contrast to the marked fluctuations in its rate of synthesis, ribosomal RNA continues to be degraded throughout the course of regeneration at a constant rate of 12% per day, a rate virtually identical to that observed in normal liver. The approach described here permits the accurate determination of turnover rates over intervals considerably shorter than even one half-life, and should be applicable to the study of the specific rates of synthesis and degradation of other cell components as well.
3 Two peaks of interleukin 1 expression in human leukocytes cultured with tobacco glycoprotein. We have previously shown that tobacco glycoprotein (TGP), a polyphenol-rich glycoprotein isolated from tobacco or from cigarette smoke, affects the immune system. In this study we show that TGP induces human PBL and adherent cells to produce IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Two peaks of IL-1 activity were observed; one at 18-24 h, the second at 4-6 d after initiation of culture. A similar pattern was observed for the steady state level of IL-1 mRNA. These data suggest that the production of IL-1 by cells stimulated with TGP might be a factor in cardiovascular disease associated with cigarette smoking.
3 Presence of plasma cells binding autologous antibody during an immune response. Spleen and other lymphoid tissues of rabbits immunized with human serum albumin (HSA) and human lactoferrin (LF) were examined for the presence of cells forming anti-idiotype antibodies. To detect these cells, IgG, F(ab')2, or Fab' of specific antibodies were isolated, fluorochrome-tagged with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate, and used as an idiotypic marker to detect splenic plasma cells that are producing anti-idiotypic antibody. By this procedure, we were able to demonstrate anti-idiotypic cells in surprisingly high numbers. For example, in six rabbits immunized with HSA for periods ranging from 36 to 542 d, the percentage of Ig-positive cells that stained with autologous idiotype ranged from 0.7 to 44; furthermore, cross-reactivity was observed among seven different anti-HSA preparations and two anti-LF antisera. The isotype of anti-idiotypic cells, determined by costaining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat Fc-specific anti-rabbit Ig, was shown to be predominantly IgG. These findings provide evidence of the presence of plasma cells producing antibody to autologous idiotype during a vigorous immune response.
3 Heterogeneity of natural killer cells in the mouse. Mice were treated with the bone-seeking isotope, 89Sr, cyclophosphamide, and short-term lethal irradiation in vivo, and murine spleen cells are treated with anti-Nk-1.2 plus complement (C) in vitro. Fresh spleen cell suspensions from the above groups and from beige and neonatal mice were subsequently tested for natural killer (NK) cell activity against a panel of lymphoid and nonlymphoid tumor cell target. NK cell reactivities against YAC-1, MPC-11, and Cl.18 tumors were markedly and consistently reduced in (a) mice treated with 89Sr, (b) spleen cells treated with anti-Nk-1.2 plus C, and (c) C57BL/6 bg/bg mice. In contrast, NK activities against FLD-3 and WEHI-164.1 tumors were usually normal in mice treated with 89Sr, in beige mutant mice, and in spleen cells after treatment with anti-Nk-1.2 antibody and C. It appears, therefore, that two major groups of NK cells exist in fresh mouse spleen cells suspensions. NK-A cells are marrow dependent, Nk antigen positive, and deficient in beige mice; these lyse YAC-1, MPC-11, and Cl.18 tumors. NK-B cells, which are responsible for the lysis of WEHI-164.1 and FLD-3, are Nk antigen negative, marrow independent, and unaffected by the bg/bg mutation. Other features of NK-B cells, suggest that these NK cells, although they share the characteristics mentioned above, differ among themselves especially with respect to age of maturation and susceptibility to cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. The NK-B group may therefore induce subsets that remain to be defined.
3 Tumor necrosis factor plays a protective role in experimental murine cutaneous leishmaniasis. The ability of mice to resist infection with L. major correlated directly with the capacity of their LNC to produce TNF in response to in vitro parasite challenge. Blocking TNF in vivo by passively administering anti-TNF antibodies exacerbated the course of L. major infection, resulting in substantially larger cutaneous lesions and elevated numbers of parasites within those lesions. In addition, treatment of infected mice with exogenous rHuTNF afforded host protection as evidenced by smaller lesion size and decreased parasite counts. Taken together, these results suggest a central role for TNF in resistance to L. major.
1 The organization of the mouse Igh-V locus. Dispersion, interspersion, and the evolution of VH gene family clusters. We have constructed a panel of Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cells to study the organization of the mouse VH gene families. Based on the analyses of VH gene deletions on 51 chromosomes with VH gene rearrangements, we have inferred a map order of the Igh locus that holds for both the Igha and Ighb haplotypes. We show that members of each VH gene family are generally clustered, although three family clusters (VHS107, VH36-60, VGAM3.8) are dispersed in two or three subregions of the locus. Members of two VH gene families, VHQ52 and VH7183, are extensively interspersed and map within the same subregion. An examination of the distribution of VH group members (VH II, I, and III) within the locus suggests that two major duplications may, in part, explain the dispersed pattern of VH family clusters. The relationship of VH organization and functional expression is discussed in terms of position-dependent and complexity-driven models.
3 Chédiak-Higashi gene in humans. II. The selectivity of the defect in natural-killer and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity function. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytolysis (ADCC) of human tumor cells by FcR(+) nonadherent effector lymphocytes as well as natural killer (NK) activity was markedly impaired in Chediak-Steinbrinck-Higashi Syndrome (C-HS) patients. Compared to a more than 400-fold defect in NK activity in terms of lytic units, the abnormal ADCC response in C-HS donors was 24-fold below normal suggesting a partial but not complete overlap of lymphocytes or lytic mechanisms responsible for ADCC and NK. The ADCC mechanism against erythrocyte targets, however, was normal, thereby suggesting a qualitative difference in these two forms of ADCC. Other effector-cell functions against tumor-cell targets were normal as measured by (a) spontaneous cytolysis mediated by monocytes, (b) spontaneous cytostasis mediated by neutrophils, and (c) lectin-dependent cytolysis mediated by neutrophils. Although one C-HS patient was low in lectin-dependent cytolysis mediated by lymphocytes, the other C-HS patient was normal, thereby suggesting that cytolytic T function was not linked to the NK-ADCC defect. In addition, the proliferative response to T-dependent mitogens was also relatively normal. These results, combined with other studies showing normal cell-mediated and humoral immunity in these same patients, suggest that patients with C-HS have an immunodeficiency which is selective for NK and ADCC activity.
1 Recombinant interleukin 4 suppresses the production of interferon gamma by human mononuclear cells. rIL-4 inhibits the production of IFN-gamma by PBMC stimulated with mitogens or allogeneic cells. The suppression is observed at the protein and at the mRNA level; it is dose and time dependent, and it is abolished by a neutralizing mAb to IL-4. It is suggested that the balance between the production of IL-4 and IFN-gamma may be significantly influenced by the chronological order of activation of their respective gene.
3 Ir gene function in an I-A subregion mutant B6.C-H-2bm12. The B6.C-H2bm12 (bm 12) strain has a mutation in the I-A subregion of the murine H-2 complex and is characterized by a loss of serologically detected Ia antigens and a strong graft rejection and mixed lymphocyte response between parent and mutant. It was presumed that the mutation affected the Ia-1 gene and to determine the relationship of Ia antigens and Ir genes, the immune responses of mutant and parent were compared. The immune responses to poly(L-Tyr,LGlu)-poly(DLAla)--poly(LLys), poly(Phe,Glu)-poly(DLAla)--poly(LLys), and poly(His,Glu)-poly(DLAla)--poly(LLys) in parent and mutant were same, indicating the Ia-1 and the Ir genes for these antigens are not identical. By contrast, although C57BL/6 gave a good response, the mutant strain was unable to generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes to the male-specific H-Y antigen--a response under I-A subregion Ir gene control, which now must be considered to be the Ia-1 gene. In addition, complementary Ir genes in the H-2b haplotype for the H-Y immune response could be detected when the bm12 mutant was used.
3 Characterization of interleukin 5 receptors on eosinophilic sublines from human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. The T cell product interleukin 5 (IL-5) has been shown to be a key factor in the development and the maturation of the eosinophilic cell lineage. We report here on the detection of human IL-5 receptors on eosinophilic sublines of the promyelocytic leukemia HL-60. Sodium butyrate, which initiates differentiation to mature eosinophils, also induces the appearance of high affinity (Kd 1-5 X 10(-11) M) IL-5 binding sites on these cells. The receptors are specific for IL-5, since binding of radiolabeled ligand can only be inhibited with homologous or murine IL-5 and not by other cytokines. We further show that the receptors are functional, since IL-5 can stimulate the proliferation of these cells. Affinity crosslinking of surface-bound 125I human IL-5 or 35S mouse IL-5 identified two membrane polypeptides of approximately 60 and approximately 130 kD to which IL-5 is closely associated. The presence of granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor or tumor necrosis factor during butyrate induction decreased the expression of IL-5 binding sites compared with control cultures. The identification and characterization of human IL-5 receptors on HL-60 sublines should provide new insight into the role of this cytokine in eosinophil differentiation.
1 Guinea pig immune response-related histocompatibility antigens. Partial characterization and distribution. We have previously demonstrated that guinea pig alloantisera directed at strain 2 and strain 13 membrane antigens block specific lymphocyte activation in immune response gene-controlled systems. In this communication we describe the partial characterization of the antigens against which these antisera are directed (the 2 and 13 antigens) and, in addition, that of the B antigen which by distribution resembles the human HL-A and mouse H-2 major histocompatibility antigens. Lymphoid cells from strain 2 and strain 13 guinea pigs were surface labeled with 125I by the lactoperoxidase technique. Nonidet P-40 extracts of these labeled cells were precipitated by sandwiches of strain 2 antistrain 13, strain 13 antistrain 2, or outbred anti-B antisera, followed by rabbit antiguinea pig immunoglobulin antisera. Precipitates were dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive peaks representing the 2 and B-cell membrane antigens were obtained from strain 2 lymph node cells, as well as from a B-lymphoid cell population (L2C leukemia cells) and a T-lymphocyte population (STRAIN 2 PERITONEAL EXUDATE LYMPHOCYTES [PELs]). Radioactive peaks representing the 13 and B-cell membrane antigens were obtained from strain 13 lymph node cells and strain 13 PELs. All anti-B precipitates produced two peaks when electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gels; one representing an antigen with a mol wt of approximately 45,000, and one representing an antigen with a mol wt of about 12,000. Both may be components of a single protein. All anti-2 and anti-13 precipitates produced a single peak when electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gels. Both the 2 and 13 antigens were found by this technique to have mol wt of approximately 25,000. By molecular weight criteria, as well as by previously investigated distributional criteria, the B antigen is similar to the human LA and Four antigens, and to the mouse D and K antigens, and the 2 and 13 antigens are similar to the mouse Ia antigens.
3 Immune human lymphocytes produce an acid-labile alpha-interferon. We have described in this paper a novel human interferon (IFN) with antigenic and cross-species reactivity of alpha-IFN and physicochemical properties of gamma-IFN. This IFN is produced by normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells during an immune response but has also been associated with autoimmune disease (10). The system described here will be useful in elucidating the biological significance and cell of origin of this IFN.
3 Distinct recognition phenotypes exist for T cell clones specific for small peptide regions of proteins. Implications for the mechanisms underlying major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen recognition and clonal deletion models of immune response gene defects. Using synthetic peptides as antigens, it was found that T cell clones of a given haplotype specific for 13-16 amino acid peptides could be clearly distinguished by the varied influence of amino acid substitutions on recognition. This was true for different antigenic determinants within peptides 81-96 and 74-86 of hen egg-white lysozyme, recognized in the context of the I-Ab and I-Ak molecules, respectively. Considerable complexity was demonstrated in the induced T cell repertoire specific for apparently single determinants, which implies that diversity of T cell recognition approaches that for B cells. The implications of the degeneracy of T cell recognition are discussed in the context of mechanisms through which Ia molecules restrict recognition and theories of Ir gene defects.
3 Idiotypes of anti-Ia antibodies. I. Expression of the 14-4-4S idiotype in humoral immune responses. The idiotype of a mouse monoclonal anti-I-E antibody, 14-4-4S, has been studied using a heterologous anti-idiotypic reagent. This antibody recognizes Ia. 7, an antigenic specificity present in all strains expressing a product of the I-E subregion. Expression of the 14-4-4S idiotype in humoral immune responses was analyzed by an idiotype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. The idiotype was readily detectable in C3H.SW anti-C3H alloantisera, the same immunization combination from which the hybridoma was derived. Absorption analysis demonstrated the anti-I-E specificity of the idiotype-positive molecules in these alloantisera. Penetrance of idiotype expression was high among individual C3H.SW immune mice (9 of 10 tested). To examine genetic requirements for idiotype expression, an immunization was performed using as responders CWB mice, congenic with C3H.SW but differing at the heavy chain allotype loci. Immune sera of individual CWB mice contained very little or no idiotype, demonstrating that levels of idiotype expression are influenced by allotype-linked genes, although the influence of other genes has not been ruled. The 14-4-4S idiotype therefore represents a shared idiotype of anti-Ia antibodies and provides opportunities for analysis of the idiotypes of cellular receptors for the corresponding Ia antigen.
2 Widespread intradermal accumulation of mononuclear leukocytes in lepromatous leprosy patients treated systemically with recombinant interferon gamma. Intradermal administration of recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma) to lepromatous leprosy patients has converted the local histology toward a tuberculoid pattern. However, such changes have been confined to the site of injection. In contrast, in the present study, marked, intradermal accumulation of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD1a+ T cells and Leu-M5+ mononuclear phagocytes was induced at a distance from the sites of administration, in a dose-dependent manner, by 10 daily intramuscular injections of 10-30 micrograms rIFN-gamma/m2. Mononuclear cell infiltration began within 3 d of onset of rIFN-gamma therapy and persisted at least 8 wk. Intramuscular administration of rIFN-gamma to lepromatous patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy can safely induce widespread histologic features of an upgrading reaction.
3 Correlation between CD8 dependency and determinant density using peptide-induced, Ld-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We have taken advantage of some unique properties of H-2Ld to investigate the determinant density requirements for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) priming versus effector function and to correlate the determinant density requirements with CD8 dependency. In a previous study (Lie, W.-R., N. B. Myers, J. Gorka, R. J. Rubocki, J. M. Connolly, and T. H. Hansen. 1990. Nature [Lond.]. 344:439), we demonstrated that culturing normal cells with peptides known to be restricted by H-2Ld led to a two- to fourfold increase in surface Ld expression. In the present study, we demonstrate the generation of Ld-restricted, peptide-specific in vitro primary CTL by culturing spleen cells with murine cytomegalovirus or tum- peptide at concentrations previously shown to result in maximum induction of Ld expression. Target cells can be sensitized for recognition by these CTL with lower dose of peptide than are required for the primary sensitization. This demonstrates differences in the determinant density requirements for priming versus effector function. The in vitro primary CTL generated with peptide can weakly lyse target cells that express the determinant endogenously, and CTL lines and clones capable of strong lysis of endogenous expressors are easily obtained. In both cases, target cells treated with exogenous peptide are lysed better than target cells expressing antigen endogenously. This suggested that there are differences in the determinant density of peptide-fed versus endogenous targets. This interpretation was substantiated when it was observed that the level of lysis of target cells expressing endogenous determinants correlated inversely with the amount of peptide required to sensitize targets for recognition by various tum- -specific CTL clones. Furthermore, simultaneous titration of both the peptide used to treat target cells and the antibody to CD8 revealed that the various CTL clones analyzed displayed widely disparate CD8 dependencies. In each case, the CD8 dependency correlated inversely with the determinant density requirement. Therefore, CD8 dependency of CTL is relative, but shows an absolute and quantitative correlation with their dependency on determinant density. These findings suggest that under physiologic conditions, where only low determinant densities are likely to be encountered, all CTL clones will show at least partial CD8 dependency.
1 In vitro and in vivo effects of rat kidney vascular endothelial cells on osteogenesis of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells growing on polylactide-glycoli acid (PLGA) scaffolds. It is well established that vascularization is critical for osteogenesis. However, adequate vascularization also remains one of the major challenges in tissue engineering of bone. This problem is further accentuated in regeneration of large volume of tissue. Although a complex process, vascularization involves reciprocal regulation and functional interaction between endothelial and osteoblast-like cells during osteogenesis. This prompted us to investigate the possibility of producing bone tissue both in vitro and ectopically in vivo using vascular endothelial cells because we hypothesized that the direct contact or interaction between vascular endothelial cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are of benefit to osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo. For that purpose we co-cultured rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and kidney vascular endothelial cells (VEC) with polylactide-glycolic acid scaffolds. In vitro experiments using alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin assays demonstrated the proliferation and differentiation of MSC into osteoblast-like cells, especially the direct contact between VEC and MSC. In addition, histochemical analysis with CD31 and von-Willebrand factor staining showed that VEC retained their endothelial characteristics. In vivo implantation of MSC and VEC co-cultures into rat's muscle resulted in pre-vascular network-like structure established by the VEC in the PLGA. These structures developed into vascularized tissue, and increased the amount and size of the new bone compared to the control group (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the vascular endothelial cells could efficiently stimulate the in vitro proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast-like cells and promote osteogenesis in vivo by the direct contact or interaction with the MSC. This technique for optimal regeneration of bone should be further investigated.
0 Immune response genes controlling responsiveness to major transplantation antigens. Specific major histocompatibility complex-linked defect for antibody responses to class I alloantigens. We have identified two major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked Ir genes that control the antibody response made by rats against class I major alloantigens. We have named these genes Ir-RT1Aa and Ir-RT1Ac. These Ir genes determine responsiveness of the immunized animal in a typical codominant fashion. There is no evidence so far for trans-complementation between low-responder haplotypes. Detailed studies of Ir-RT1Aa indicate that it controls the antibody response to at least two distinct alloantigenic determinants on RT1Aa molecules. These class I molecules thus behave like hapten-carrier conjugates when the response against the carrier is under Ir gene control. Analysis of the origin of alloantibody-forming cells in tetraparental radiation chimeras indicates that Ir-RT1Aa must control the provision of effective help to B cells. In many respects therefore, the properties of Ir-RT1Aa are broadly similar to those described for Ir genes controlling antibody responses to conventional antigens. The existence of apparently conventional Ir genes controlling the antibody response to major alloantigens strongly suggest that the processing of these transmembrane molecules by host antigen-presenting cells is a prerequisite for immune induction, and that it is the MHC of the responder rather than that of the allograft to which T helper cells are restricted in alloimmune responses in vivo.
1 Analysis of a human V beta gene subfamily. We have isolated and sequenced five germline V beta gene segments that are homologous to the V region of the YT35 cDNA encoding the beta chain of the T cell antigen receptor from the tumor MOLT-3. One of these gene segments is identical to the YT35 V segment, and therefore is the corresponding germline V beta gene segment encoding the YT35 cDNA. The other four V beta members exhibit 77-98% homology to the YT35 V gene segment. Two of these V beta gene segments are pseudogenes. Analyses of the coding region sequences reveal that, although the V beta segments are very diverse, they are mutating at a rate comparable to that observed in most eukaryotic genes. Analyses of the genomic clones show that the spacing distance between germline V beta gene segments ranges from 3 kb to greater than 30 kb, and the entire V beta 8 subfamily appears to be linked by a total of no more than 110 kb of DNA.
3 Voltage-gated potassium channels are required for human T lymphocyte activation. The calcium channel blockers, verapamil and diltiazem, inhibit phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced mitogenesis at concentrations that block the T lymphocyte K channel currents. K channel blockers also inhibit the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte response in a dose-dependent manner with the same potency sequence as for block of K currents. K channel blockers inhibit PHA-stimulated mitogenesis only if added during the first 20-30 h after PHA addition, but not later, indicating a requirement for functional K channels during this period. We investigated the effect of K channel blockers on various aspects of protein synthesis for two reasons: first, protein synthesis appears to be necessary for the events leading to DNA synthesis, and second, the increase in the protein synthetic rate commences during the first 24-48 h after PHA addition. PHA-induced total protein synthesis was reduced to the level in unstimulated T lymphocytes by K channel blockers in a dose-dependent manner with the same potency sequence as for the block of K currents and inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated that although the synthesis of the majority of proteins was reduced by K channel blockers to the level in unstimulated T cells, some proteins continued to be synthesized at an enhanced rate compared with resting cells. Two proteins, S and T, detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in unstimulated T lymphocytes, appeared to be reduced in intensity in gels of PHA-treated T lymphocytes, in contrast to the increased synthesis of the remaining proteins. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP), at concentrations that inhibit protein synthesis, prevented the apparent PHA-induced reduction of proteins S and T. These proteins may play a role in maintaining the T lymphocyte in a resting state and may be related to the translation inhibitory factors reported to be present at a higher specific activity in quiescent T lymphocytes than in PHA-activated T cells. The expression of the IL-2 receptor (Tac) during T lymphocyte activation was not altered by K channel blockers, whereas the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2) was reduced to the level in unstimulated T lymphocytes. Exogenous IL-2 partially relieved the inhibition of mitogenesis by low, but not by high, concentrations of 4-AP. These experiments clarify the role of K channels in T lymphocyte activation and suggest that functional K channels are required either for protein synthesis or for events leading to protein synthesis.
1 Antibodies to interleukin 2. Effects on immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Antibodies to highly purified mouse interleukin 2 (IL-2) were raised in rabbits; a 1:500 dilution of antiserum completely blocked the in vitro mitogenic effect of 10(-9) M IL-2. The antisera functioned effectively to immunoprecipitate biosynthetically labeled IL-2 and the purified immunoglobulins were useful in the construction of affinity columns for the adsorption and one-step immunopurification of IL-2. The antibodies were apparently specific for IL-2 among the lymphokines, they did not block the biological effects of IL-1, IL-3, gamma-IFN, B cell stimulating factor(s), and cytotoxic T cell differentiation factor(s). When anti-IL-2 was added to the in vitro reactions, it blocked mixed leukocyte reactions (MLR) and associated lymphocyte proliferation, the in vitro generation of cytotoxic T cells, and antibody formation as assessed by erythrocyte-specific plaque-forming cells (PFC). When injected into mice, anti-IL-2 antibodies also reduced the formation of cytotoxic lymphocytes in response to allogeneic cells, suggesting that endogenous IL-2 participates in such reactions in vivo. Taken together, the results indicate that these IL-2 antibodies will be useful adjuncts in the analysis of immune response both in vivo and in vitro.
2 Inheritance of antibody specificity. II. Anti-(4-hydroxy-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl in the mouse. Mice of 17 inbred strains produced anti-(4-hydroxy-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)-acetyl (NBrP) of three different fine specificity types. Anti-NBrP antibodies of all allotype b mice (five strains tested) had a high relative affinity for (4-hydroxy-3.5-dinitrophenyl) acetyl (NNP) but low for (4-hydroxy-5-cloro-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl (NCP). Another category was characterized by high relative affinity for NCP but low for NNP. This category included most of the tested strains. The third category (CBA and C3H strains) had an intermediate fine specificity. Associated with fine specificity characteristics were anti-NBrP titers, mice of allotype b had lower titers than the other mice. Studies of congenic, recombinant inbred, F1 and backcross mice showed that both fine specificity and the magnitude of the anti-NBrP response of tbalb/C MICE WERE CONTROLLED BY AN ALLOTYPE-LINKED GENE. This gene was dominant over the C57BL/6 ALLELE. Lack of recombinant mice in the backcross generatioterns on the other suggest close linkage between the two genes.
1 The V gamma locus of the human T cell receptor gamma gene. Repertoire polymorphism of the first variable gene segment subgroup. Southern blot analysis using a genomic probe of the human TCR-gamma chain first variable gene subgroup (V gamma I) was performed on DNA samples from both parents of 36 healthy Caucasian families. Two types of polymorphisms were found in these 72 unrelated DNA samples: three repertoire polymorphisms and two restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). In all cases, Mendelian inheritance of these polymorphisms was demonstrated. The most frequent repertoire polymorphism consists in the lack of the V gamma 4 and V gamma 5 segments. In 16% of chromosomes, the Eco RI and Taq I restriction fragments corresponding to V gamma 4 and V gamma 5 were lacking, with no additional bands. In these cases, a decrease of 10 kb was observed in the Bam HI fragment containing all V gamma I segments as compared with samples containing V gamma 4-V gamma 5 segments. To better understand this polymorphism, which takes place in a previously incompletely defined region, the central part of the V gamma I region, including the polymorphic V gamma 4-V gamma 5 segments, was cloned. This allowed us to localize precisely the V gamma 5 segment and thus complete the description of the V gamma I region. A striking homology of DNA and deduced amino acid sequences is present between V gamma 2 and V gamma 4 and between V gamma 3 and V gamma 5, much higher than that observed between V gamma 2 and V gamma 3 and between V gamma 4 and V gamma 5. The differences in nucleotide sequence occur mainly in the intron and three hypervariable regions. These results strongly suggest a gene duplication relationship between the segments V gamma 2-V gamma 3 and the segments V gamma 4-V gamma 5. The most frequent RFLP documented in this study is due to the combined absence of the Eco RI and the Taq I sites located in the noncoding region between V gamma 3 and V gamma 4. The haplotypic frequence of this RFLP is 6.9% of the general population. As the gamma/delta receptor may play an important role in immunological response, the biological relevance of the high degree of polymorphism occurring in the V gamma I region, as well as its possible association with some immune disturbances, should be further explored.
3 Human complement in the arachidonic acid transformation pathway in platelets. Arachidonate-mediated release of 14C serotonin and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) is significantly enhanced in the presence of complement. Only purified complement components C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9 are required for this reactivity. No known activating mechanism of the classical or alternative pathway is required, nor is C3. In the absence of exogenously added complement, platelet membrane-bound complement components play an essential role in modulating arachidonate-mediated serotonin release. Incubation of platelet membranes with arachidonate and C5--C9 led to the production of dimers of the membrane attack complex (C5b--9) on the platelet surface. These macromolecular complexes were eluted from the platelet membrane and were identified physicochemically and morphologically. The possibility arises that C3 in association with C5--C9 is required for mobilization of the arachidonic acid from the phospholipid of the platelet membrane. Once the arachidonic acid is mobilized, C3 is no longer required, C5--C9 being sufficient to modulate this pathway leading to enhanced production of TXB2.
3 Thymocyte clones from 14-day mouse embryos. I. State of T cell receptor genes, surface markers, and growth requirements. We have established in culture 13 clones from the thymus of a 14-d B10.BR mouse embryo and characterized 8 of them. All eight FT clones have the TCR-gamma and -beta genes in germline configuration. They express mRNA for the gamma, but not for the beta nor the alpha genes. All eight FT clones are Thy-1+, Ly-1+, LFA-1+, Pgp-1+, H-2K+, and T3-. Three phenotypes could be distinguished on the basis of Lyt-2, L3T4, and IL-2-R expression: Lyt-2+, L3T4-, IL-2-R+ (I); Lyt-2+, L3T4-, IL-2-R- (II); and Lyt-2+, L3T4+, IL-2-R+ (III) cells. All eight clones grow in rIL-4 and six clones also proliferate in rIL-2. Antibodies specific for IL-2-R inhibit their response to rIL-2 but not to rIL-4. The eight FT clones synthesize mRNA for IL-4 after stimulation in vitro and none of them exhibit cytolytic activity or helper function for B lymphocytes. We conclude that the FT clones are at a very early stage of T cell development, that the expression of Lyt-2 and L3T4 surface molecules can precede that of the antigen receptor, and that the same fetal thymocyte can use both IL-4 and IL-2 as growth factor.
0 Detection of the human T cell lymphoma virus p19 in cells of some patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma and leukemia using a monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody specific for the internal p19 protein of a type-C retrovirus (HTLV) isolated from human neoplastic T cells has been developed. Its specificity has been shown by radioimmune precipitation and by affinity chromatography of iodinated HTLV proteins. By indirect immune fluorescence this antibody recognizes only HTLV-producing cells. Examination of cells from patients with cutaneous T cell lymphomas and leukemias and with other types of lymphomas and leukemias indicated that HTLV p19 expression is rare. The monoclonal antibody will be useful in determining the natural reservoir of HTLV, possibly in a subset of mature T cell neoplasias.
3 Three T cell hybridomas do not contain detectable heavy chain variable gene transcripts. We attempted to determine whether T cells express any VH gene segments. cDNA libraries were constructed from one suppressor and two helper T cell hybridomas. Both the library construction and screening were designed to maximize detection of a wide range of VH gene segments. One screening method should detect about half of the sequenced VH genes, while the second should detect most of these genes. The probability of detecting a VH gene homologous to the probes and present at 10 copies per cell was 77% for one helper cell cDNA library, 88% for the second helper cell library, and greater than 99% for the suppressor cell library. No cDNA clones with VH gene segments were detected. From this result, we conclude that VH gene segments are not likely to encode the antigen-specific receptor in the cells we tested.
3 Induction of plasminogen activator synthesis by antibodies. We have purified the immunoglobulins (IgG) from rabbit antisera raised against two cell lines--LLC-PK1 derived from pig kidney and from Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed BALB/3T3--and have studied the effects of IgG on cultures of the respective target cells. The following observations were made with both cell types: (a) The addition of purified IgG produced a rapid change in morphology within 2 h. This consisted of cell rounding, agglutination, and detachment from the surface of the dish. (b) Beginning approximately 2 h after IgG addition there was a progressive rise in plasminogen activator production for 24--36 h. (c) Both the morphological change and the induction of plasminogen activator (PA) synthesis were reversible and required the continued presence of IgG for their maintenance. The increase in PA production, but not morphological change, depended on genetic transcription and translation, being inhibited by actinomycin and/or cycloheximide. (d). These effects of IgG were specific: they were not observed with preimmune or indifferent IgG and occurred only after interaction between an IgG preparation from antisera and the cells used to generate the particular antiserum. The divalent IgG fragments F(ab')2 retained fully the activities of the native IgG molecules from which they were derived.
3 Virus-induced diabetes mellitus. VI. Genetically determined host differences in the replicating of encephalomyocarditis virus in pancreatic beta cells. Beta cells were isolated from strains of mice that were susceptible and resistant to encephalomyocarditis (EMC) viral-induced diabetes mellitus. Beta cells from susceptible mice that were infected in vivo with EMC virus showed higher viral titers, more severe degranulation, and lower concentrations of immunoreactive insulin than beta cells from resistant mice. Immunofluorescence and infectious center assays revealed that pancreas from susceptible mice contained at least 10 times more infected cells than pancreas from resistant mice. Beta cell cultures prepared from susceptible mice and infected in vitro also showed higher viral titers and more severe cytopathologic changes than beta cell cultures from resistant mice. In contrast to beta cell cultures, virus replicated equally well in primary embryo and kidney cell cultures from susceptible and resistant strains of mice. It is concluded that the development of EMC virus-induced diabetes is related to genetically determined host differences in the capacity of the virus to infect beta cells.
0 Human rheumatoid factor crossidiotypes. I. WA and BLA are heat-labile conformational antigens requiring both heavy and light chains. Evidence was obtained that both the WA and BLA crossidiotype (XId) groups are conformational antigens requiring both L and H chains and that with heat denaturation the antigens that define the XIds and antigen-binding activity are lost in parallel. In contrast, the primary structure-dependent crossreactive idiotype (CRI), PSL2, which is only weakly detected on native Wa and Bla monoclonal rheumatoid factors (mRFs), became prominently detected on the heated Wa and Bla mRFs. Heat denaturation may provide a simple method for distinguishing Ids determined by conformational antigen from primary structure-dependent Ids. In addition to heat denaturation, some acid conditions commonly used for preparation of RFs were also found to cause marked loss of Id antigen. The finding of PSL2-CRI on Bla mRF indicates that this Id is not unique to the WA XId.
2 Physiology of IgD. VI. Transfer of the immunoaugmenting effect of IgD with T delta-containing helper cell populations. We show that the IgD-induced augmentation of the immune response to trinitrophenylated keyhole limpet hemocyanin can be transferred to syngeneic mice with spleen cells from IgD-injected donors. The augmenting activity is present in the Lyt-1+2-, L3T4+ T cell population and is absent from B cells. The ability of transferred T cells to augment the immune response correlates with the presence of a high frequency of Lyt-1+2- T cells that form rosettes with IgD-coated sheep erythrocytes (T delta cells). Such rosette-forming cells can also be induced by incubation of spleen cells from normal donors in IgD-coated petri dishes. Injection of normal spleen cells exposed to IgD-coated petri dishes together with antigen also augments the immune response of recipients. The existence of a regulatory circuit based upon interactions between T delta cells, antigen, B cell surface IgD, and serum IgD, is proposed.
2 Genetic and temporal control of neonatal antibody expression. Two hybridoma cell lines were established with B cells derived from neonatal BALB/c spleen cells. The anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) antibodies derived from these lines were characterized with respect to their isotype, affinity, and isoelectric point. Antiidiotypic reagents were prepared that permit an analysis of the representation of antibodies sharing idiotype with these two hybridomas in the developing and mature B cell pool of BALB/c mice (Igha) and other murine strains. One of the two antibodies, TF2-36, was found to be indistinguishable from 14% of anti-DNP monoclonal antibodies derived in fragment culture from spleen cells of 1-4-d-old BALB/c donors. B cells expressing this idiotype were found to represent approximately 2% of the anti-DNP-specific repertoire after the 1st wk of neonatal development and into adulthood. The second hybridoma antibody, TF2-76, was found to be expressed at very low levels during the first several days of neonatal development; however, B cells expressing this idiotype increased in frequency during the 2nd wk of neonatal development representing 7% of all DNP-responsive B cells 12-13 d after birth. The proportion of B cells expressing this idiotype also decreased to approximately 2% in adults. The relatively late appearance of B cells bearing this idiotype was confirmed by their susceptibility to tolerance induction after the 1st wk of neonatal development. Both the early neonatal clonotype, TF2-36, and the late neonatal antibody clonotype, TF2-76, were found to be expressed in a similar fashion in F1 mice constructed between Igha and Ighb parentals, but both were expressed at very low levels during the development of Ighb mice. Thus, the control of the magnitude of expression of these neonatal clonotypes appears to be associated with the Igh locus.
2 Inflammatory properties of recombinant tumor necrosis factor in rabbit skin in vivo. We have investigated the ability of recombinant TNF (mouse and human) to produce acute inflammatory lesions in an established experimental model of inflammation. Upon intradermal injection in rabbit skin, TNF, in amounts as low as 3 x 10(-14) mol/site, was found to be very potent at inducing local neutrophil accumulation and neutrophil-dependent oedema formation, thereby fulfilling two important criteria to be considered as an inflammatory mediator. Our findings further indicate that the pro-inflammatory properties of TNF are probably more related to its immediate stimulatory effects on neutrophils rather than to its slow (protein biosynthesis-dependent effects on endothelial cells. Our data thus show that very low amounts of mouse and human recombinant TNF can initiate an acute inflammatory reaction in vivo in rabbit skin and that TNF is able to evoke two of the four cardinal signs of inflammation.
1 Population response to habitat fragmentation in a stream-dwelling brook trout population. Fragmentation can strongly influence population persistence and expression of life-history strategies in spatially-structured populations. In this study, we directly estimated size-specific dispersal, growth, and survival of stream-dwelling brook trout in a stream network with connected and naturally-isolated tributaries. We used multiple-generation, individual-based data to develop and parameterize a size-class and location-based population projection model, allowing us to test effects of fragmentation on population dynamics at local (i.e., subpopulation) and system-wide (i.e., metapopulation) scales, and to identify demographic rates which influence the persistence of isolated and fragmented populations. In the naturally-isolated tributary, persistence was associated with higher early juvenile survival ( approximately 45% greater), shorter generation time (one-half) and strong selection against large body size compared to the open system, resulting in a stage-distribution skewed towards younger, smaller fish. Simulating barriers to upstream migration into two currently-connected tributary populations caused rapid (2-6 generations) local extinction. These local extinctions in turn increased the likelihood of system-wide extinction, as tributaries could no longer function as population sources. Extinction could be prevented in the open system if sufficient immigrants from downstream areas were available, but the influx of individuals necessary to counteract fragmentation effects was high (7-46% of the total population annually). In the absence of sufficient immigration, a demographic change (higher early survival characteristic of the isolated tributary) was also sufficient to rescue the population from fragmentation, suggesting that the observed differences in size distributions between the naturally-isolated and open system may reflect an evolutionary response to isolation. Combined with strong genetic divergence between the isolated tributary and open system, these results suggest that local adaptation can 'rescue' isolated populations, particularly in one-dimensional stream networks where both natural and anthropogenically-mediated isolation is common. However, whether rescue will occur before extinction depends critically on the race between adaptation and reduced survival in response to fragmentation.
3 Idiotype-like molecules on cells of a human T cell leukemia. Two monoclonal antibodies were obtained that showed unique specificities for the leukemic T cells used for immunization. One antibody, S160, was totally specific for the antigen. The other antibody, S511, also reacted with a small population of normal T cells. This was made especially evident by concentrating these normal T cells with the antibody. Considerable evidence was obtained that both antibodies reacted with the same membrane molecules. In the unreduced state a major component of approximately 80 kdaltons was observed; after reduction this split into two components of approximately 43 and approximately 38 kdaltons. The reaction of the two antibodies with different antigenic sites on the same molecule, one representing a private site and the other a more cross-reactive site, strongly suggests an antibodylike molecule, but composed of polypeptide chains differing from immunoglobulins.
1 STRALCP--structure alignment-based clustering of proteins. Protein structural annotation and classification is an important and challenging problem in bioinformatics. Research towards analysis of sequence-structure correspondences is critical for better understanding of a protein's structure, function, and its interaction with other molecules. Clustering of protein domains based on their structural similarities provides valuable information for protein classification schemes. In this article, we attempt to determine whether structure information alone is sufficient to adequately classify protein structures. We present an algorithm that identifies regions of structural similarity within a given set of protein structures, and uses those regions for clustering. In our approach, called STRALCP (STRucture ALignment-based Clustering of Proteins), we generate detailed information about global and local similarities between pairs of protein structures, identify fragments (spans) that are structurally conserved among proteins, and use these spans to group the structures accordingly. We also provide a web server at http://as2ts.llnl.gov/AS2TS/STRALCP/ for selecting protein structures, calculating structurally conserved regions and performing automated clustering.
2 Immunoregulatory circuits that modulate responsiveness to suppressor cell signal. Failure of B10 mice to respond to suppressor factors can be overcome by quenching the contrasuppressor circuit. The in vitro antibody response of spleen cells from B10 strain mice is not suppressed by factor preparations made by primed Ly-2 T cells, although these preparations can suppress the in vitro antibody response of spleen cells from other mouse strains (1-3)2. The factor preparations from Ly-2 cells contain at least two separable activities: one that acts as a suppressor moiety (Ly-2 T cell suppressor factor [Ly-2 TsF]) and a second factor that acts as an inducer of contrasuppression (Ly-2 TcsiF); the latter initiates a series of cellular interactions that leads to the inhibition of suppression that we refer to as contrasuppression. Removal of components (either cellular or humoral) of the contrasuppressor circuit makes spleen cells from B10 strain mice as easily suppressible as are those of other mouse strains. Thus, removal of the contrasuppressor inducer cell and/or its biologically active product with the use of an anit-J serum, or removal of the functional acceptor of the inducer cell with the same or other (Ly-2; Qa-1) antisera breaks the B10 suppressor barrier. Contrasuppressive activity. but not helper activity can be eluted from anit-I-J immunoabsorbents. The addition of B10 T cells to either B6 or B10 spleen cell culture deprived of acceptor cells for the TcsiF reconstitutes contrasuppression more efficiently than does the addition of C57BL/6 T cells. Ly-2 TcsiF is more cross-reactive than is Ly-2 TsF so that absorption of factor preparations from sheep erythrocyte-primed Ly-2 cells with horse erythrocytes also breaks the B10 suppressor barrier. The hyperresponsiveness of splenic T cells from B10 strains to Ly-2 TcsiF may be an in vitro exaggeration of a normal in vivo process. Thus it is possible that one can take advantage of this unusual situation to help dissect out the cellular and subcellular components of T cell circuits that moldulate sensitivity to immunoregulatory signals.
0 Functional characterization of synthetic leukotriene B and its stereochemical isomers. Leukotriene B (LTB), a potent lipid chemotactic factor for neutrophils, is 5S,12R-dihydroxy-6,14-cis,8,10-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid (Fig 1), based upon direct comparison of natural LTB with synthetic 5S,12R-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,12-di-HETE) stereoisomers in three biological assays. Of the six synthetic stereoisomers evaluated, only the 5S,12R,6,14-cis,8,10-trans compound had chemotactic potency for human neutrophils in vitro that was comparable to that of natural LTB, with a concentration of 3 X 10(9-9) M eliciting a one-half maximum response. In contrast, the racemic mixture of 5R,12R- and 5S,12S-6,10-trans,8,14-cis, the racemic mixture of 5S,12R- and 5R,12S-6,10-trans,8,14-cis, the 5S,12R-6,8-trans,10,14-cis, the 5S,12R-6,8,10-trans,14-cis, and the 5S,12S-6,8,10-trans,14-cis stereoisomers required concentrations of 3 X 10(-7) to 1 X 10(-6) M to elicit comparable responses. Only natural LTB and its synthetic counterpart elicited a local neutrophil infiltration when injected into the skin of the rhesus monkey at 10 ng and 100 ng per site. Natural and synthetic LTB at a concentration of 3 X 10(-8) M each provoked an EC25 contractile response of guinea pig pulmonary parenchymal strips in vitro, whereas the other four tested stereoisomers of 5,12-di-HETE were inactive at this concentration. Structure-function analyses suggest that the neutrophil chemotactic activity depends critically upon the C-1 to C-12 domain, including the stereochemistry of the 6-,8-,and 10-olefinic bonds and the presence of both hydroxyl groups.
3 Evidence for human T cell lymphoma-leukemia virus infection of family members of human T cell lymphoma-leukemia virus positive T cell leukemia-lymphoma patients. Sera of family members of patients from the United States, the Caribbean, and Japan, with human T cell lymphoma-leukemia virus (HTLV) associated T cell malignancies, possess HTLV-specific antibodies directed against internal structural components of HTLV, p24 and p19. The prevalence of antibodies to HTLV is greater in family members than in random healthy donors, which supports the infectious nature of HTLV and its association with particular aggressive T cell malignancies. Expression of HTLV p24 and p19 has also been observed in cultured T cells of some healthy relatives, and intact virus particles have been released from cells of one possibly pre-leukemic family member.
3 Streptococcal cell walls and synovial cell activation. Stimulation of synovial fibroblast plasminogen activator activity by monocytes treated with group A streptococcal cell wall sonicates and muramyl dipeptide. Group A streptococcal peptidoglycan has previously been shown to be arthritogenic in rats and has been implicated as a structure present in a class of possible etiologic agents for rheumatoid arthritis. The present study reports that conditioned medium from human monocytes, after interaction with cell wall sonicates of four group A streptococcal strains, stimulates the plasminogen activator (PA) activity of nonrheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. Low concentrations of N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D isoglutamine (muramyl dipeptide) can also generate this synovial activator (SA) activity from human monocytes. Preliminary biochemical data suggest that the SA activity is distinct from interferon-gamma, interleukin 1, and interleukin 2. These results indicate that agents that are arthritogenic in rats can modulate human synovial fibroblast functions via monocytes. The findings are proposed to have possible significance for an understanding of the cellular interactions involved in the formation and function of the rheumatoid pannus, because PA has been invoked as possibly being generally important for the processes of cell migration, tissue remodeling, and inflammation.
3 Characteristics of Epstein-Barr virus activation of human B lymphocytes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will infect at least every third cell if exposed in vitro to an extensively purified B cell population from human peripheral blood. About 10% of such infected cells will be driven into immunoglobulin synthesis and secretion, as judged by the indirect protein A plaque assay. The appearance of EB nuclear antigen, de novo DNA synthesis, and immunoglobulin secretion are linked phenomena accompanying infection as judged by viral dilution experiments, which yield kinetics of a one-hit order. Induction of immunoglobulin secretion in B cells by EBV requires de novo synthesis of DNA, and consequently, nontransforming EBV (P3HR1) will not induce immunoglobulin secretion and will also specifically block such induction from subsequently added EBV. The termination of immunoglobulin induction by EBV in short-term cultures appears to be T cell dependent.
3 Analysis of T cell hybridomas. I. Characterization of H-2 and Igh-restricted monoclonal suppressor factors. Five hybridoma T cell lines were prepared by fusion of second order suppressor T cells (Ts2) with the BW5147 thymoma. The culture supernates from these T cell hybrids contained a factor, TsF2, which specifically suppressed 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl hapten (NP)-induced cutaneous sensitivity responses. TsF2 activity was observed when the factor was administered during the effector phases of the immune response. TsF2 bears I-J determinants and has binding specificity for NPb idiotypic determinants. TsF2 suppressor activity could be absorbed on antigen-primed H-2-incompatible T cells but cannot suppress H-2-incompatible mice. In addition to this H-2 restriction, which maps to the I-J subregion, monoclonal TsF2 also has an Igh genetic restriction. The present results are combined with previous data to describe the cellular interactions leading to immune suppression.
0 Role of arginase in killing of schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni. Nonspecific resistance to the multicellular organism Schistosoma mansoni can be induced in mice by several infectious agents. We utilized the observed genetic restriction of such acquired resistance to study the mediators of killing of the larval stage of S. mansoni in vitro. Adherent peritoneal cell monolayers from Corynebacterium parvum-treated C57BL/6J but not from C. parvum-treated BALB/cJ mice killed an increased proportion of schistosomula in 24 h. Activated macrophages (Mphi) from both strains exhibited enhanced H(2)0(2) production after incubation with the parasites or phorbol myristate acetate. Thus H(2)0(2) production was not associated with schistosomula killing. Moreover, schistosomula killing was unaffected by catalase or superoxide dismutase. In contrast, activated C57BL/6J (but not BALB/cJ) Mphi released fourfold more arginase into supernates than control Mphi. Schistosomula killing by these Mphi correlated with arginase content of the supernates, was exaggerated in arginine-poor medium, and could be blocked by the addition of arginine. Exogenous bovine arginase added to Fischer's medium without macrophages produced comparable parasite mortality. Our data suggest that arginase is a critical mediator of in vitro killing of this multicellular organism by activated macrophages.
2 Role of prethymic cells in acquisition of self-tolerance. The sequential character of T-lymphocyte development as it pertains to the stage at which self-tolerance is acquired was investigated. Three phases were studied, defined here as prethymic, intrathymic, and postthymic as determined by the timing of thymus implantation. The model utilized was the temporal pattern of skin graft rejection in thymusless BALB/c nude mice implanted with allogeneic, C57BL/6J, or syngeneic thymuses before or after skin grafting; in some instances, F(1) hybrid spleen cells were also given to newborns or young adults. These experiments in nude mice showed that, (a) self-tolerance could be established despite the absence of the host's own haplotype in the implanted thymus; (b) recently emigrated postthymic cells could already discriminate self from non-self; (c) specific neonatal tolerance could be induced in nudes by inoculation of F(1) hybrid cells; (d) nudes showed a higher capacity for induction of neonatal tolerance than did normal littermates. These findings indicate that the process of self-tolerance in the T cell's lineage begins during the prethymic state early in ontogeny.
3 Chemotactic activity generated from the fifth component of complement by plasma kallikrein of the rabbit. Rabbit plasma kallikrein incubated with rabbit C5 resulted in the generation of chemotactic and secretagogue activity for rabbit neutrophils. This effect on C5 appeared to be due to kallikrein itself and not to a contaminating enzyme, because it could be inhibited by anti-kallikrein IgG or by soybean trypsin inhibitor to the same extent the kinin generation by the same kallikrein preparation was inhibited by these agents. The chemotactic response was consistent with the generation of a C5a-like peptide from C5 because the effect could be partially inhibited by carboxypeptidase N and was related to the generation of a small (approximately 14,000 mol wt) fragment of C5. No direct chemotactic response was detectable for kallikrein, activated Hageman factor, high-molecular weight kininogen, or intact C5. Incubation of Kallikrein, high-molecular weight kininogen, and Hageman factor together, so that activation of all three proteins occurred, did not results in the generation of detectable chemotactic activity.
1 Properties of monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) purified from a human fibrosarcoma cell line. A monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) has been purified from TNF-stimulated 8387 human fibrosarcoma cell line-conditioned media. The purified MCAF showed microheterogeneity yielding two bands on SDS-PAGE analysis. Fibrosarcoma-derived MCAF specifically competed with THP-1 (a human monocytic cell line)-derived 125I-labeled MCAF in binding to human PBMC, whereas a similar basic heparin-binding leukocyte chemoattractant, IL-8, did not. The purified MCAF stimulated superoxide anion and N-acetyl beta-D glucosaminidase-releasing activity in human monocytes, as well as monocyte cytostatic augmenting activity against tumor cells and chemotactic activity for monocytes. When injected subcutaneously into Lewis rat ears, the purified human MCAF also induced considerable in vivo local monocyte infiltration beginning at 3 h and becoming maximal at 18 h. In conclusion, the data presented in this paper indicate that MCAF is a potent activator of monocytes as well as a monocyte recruitment factor that acts through receptors that are specific for this novel molecule. This novel cytokine might have an important role in tumor growth control due to its ability to attract and activate monocytes.
3 Differential requirements for the induction of interleukin 2 responsiveness in L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ T cell subsets. Minimal requirements for the induction of interleukin 2 (IL-2) responsiveness in purified subsets of murine T lymphocytes have been investigated. Whereas Lyt-2+ cells could be induced to IL-2-dependent growth by lectin, phorbol ester, or calcium ionophore, none of these stimuli was by itself sufficient for L3T4+ cells. The latter cells could, however, be induced to respond to IL-2 by combinations of lectin plus phorbol ester or ionophore plus phorbol ester (but not lectin plus ionophore). Under optimal conditions, growth of L3T4+ cells (like Lyt-2+ cells) was independent of accessory cells and cell-cell contact.
2 The nature of antiidiotype molecules induced by antiallotype. Presence of both latent allotype and allotypic internal images. Previously (9), I found that immunization of rabbits with antibody directed against variable region heavy chain VH polypeptides of a1 allotype induced the production of antiidiotype (anti-Id) molecules that appeared to bear images of the original a1 allotype. I now show that these anti-Id molecules can be fractionated into two populations: one population (a2a3- anti-Id) that lacks the nominal VH a2 or a3 allotype of the rabbit from which it was derived, and another population (a2a3+ anti-Id) that expresses these allotypes. Both anti-Id populations display epitopes that resemble a1 since: (a) they were capable of inhibiting 125I-a1 Ig binding to rabbit anti-a1, goat anti-a1, and mouse anti-a1 mAb; and (b) immunization of normal a2a3 rabbits with either anti-Id fraction led to the formation of specific anti-a1 antibody. Reductive cleavage of the anti-Id molecules showed that the a1 determinants in the a2a3- population were fully displayed on isolated H chains, consistent with the presence of latent a1 Ig. On the other hand, as expected for internal images encoded by the antigen-combining site, the a2a3+ anti-Id population required intact H and L chains for maximal a1 expression. The a1-like images within the a2a3+ anti-Id population do not appear to be identical to nominal or latent a1, however, since a2a3- anti-Id was invariably a more efficient inhibitor of a 1 Ig-anti-a1 binding than a a2a3+ anti-Id. These results indicate that immunization with antiallotype can result in the simultaneous production of both latent allotypes and allotypic internal images.
0 Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in mammalian ageing. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) catalyze the post-translational modification of proteins with poly(ADP-ribose). Two PARP isoforms, PARP-1 and PARP-2, display catalytic activity by contact with DNA-strand breaks and are involved in DNA base-excision repair and other repair pathways. A body of correlative data suggests a link between DNA damage-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and mammalian longevity. Recent research on PARPs and poly(ADP-ribose) yielded several candidate mechanisms through which poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation might act as a factor that limits the rate of ageing.
3 Clonal analysis of functionally distinct human CD4+ T cell subsets. A large number of CD4+ T cell clones, obtained from peripheral blood T lymphocytes by direct limiting dilution, allowed us to address the question whether functional heterogeneity exists within the human CD4+ T cell subset. Cytotoxic capacity of cloned T cells was analyzed with the use of anti-CD3 antibodies and target cells bearing FcR for murine IgG. 6 of 12 CD4+ clones obtained were able to lyse Daudi or P815 cells in the presence of anti-CD3 antibodies. The remaining six CD4+ T cell clones tested did not display anti-CD3-mediated cytotoxic activity and did not acquire this cytotoxic capacity during a culture period of 20 wk. In the absence of anti-CD3 mAb, no lytic activity against Daudi, P815, and K562 target cells was observed under normal culture conditions. Phenotypic analysis of these two distinct types of CD4+ T cells did not reveal differences with regard to reactivity with CDw29 (4B4) and CD45R (2H4) mAbs that have been described to recognize antigens associated with helper suppressor/inducer (respectively) CD4+ cells. The CD4+ clones without anti-CD3-mediated cytotoxic activities (Th2) consistently showed a high expression level of CD28 antigens, whereas the cytotoxic clones (Th1) expressed low amounts of CD28. Th1 CD4+ clones did produce IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha/beta, whereas the Th2 T cell clones produced minimal amounts of IL-2 and only low levels of INF-gamma and TNF-alpha/beta in response to anti-CD3 mAbs and PMA. Although not all CD4+ clones did release IL-4, there was no correlation with cytotoxic activity. Moreover, as compared with the Th1 CD4+ clones, Th2 CD4+ T cell clones proliferated moderately in response to immobilized anti-CD3 mAbs. However, proliferation reached the level of the cytotoxic clones when anti-CD28 mABs were present during culture. Both CD4+ subsets provided help for B cell differentiation upon stimulation with anti-CD3 mAbs. Our data suggest that the human CD4+ subset, in analogy to the murine system, comprises two functionally distinct T cell subpopulations, both of which are able to exert helper activity for polyclonal B cell differentiation, but which differ in cytotoxic capacity, lymphokine production, and requirements for proliferation. A function for these two types of T cells in the immune response is discussed.
3 Lipid IVA inhibits synthesis and release of tumor necrosis factor induced by lipopolysaccharide in human whole blood ex vivo. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) released by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mononuclear phagocytes is a critical mediator of sepsis. We examined the capacities of rough mutant Salmonella typhimurium LPS (Rc) and LPS partial structures lipid A, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), lipid IVA, and lipid X to induce production of TNF in whole blood. Rc LPS (0.0001-10 ng/ml) produced a dose-dependent release of TNF as determined by cytotoxicity of actinomycin D-sensitized L929 murine fibroblasts. Lipid A, MPLA, lipid IVA, and lipid X exhibited decreasing capacities to stimulate production of TNF in whole blood, respectively. Fractional deacylation of LPS by incubation with acyloxyacyl hydrolase isolated from human leukocytes produced a reduction in the capacity of LPS to induce TNF release in whole blood. Maximal enzymatic deacylation reduced activity of LPS by greater than 100-fold. Coincubation with lipid IVA inhibited TNF release induced by Rc LPS or lipid A, but not by phorbol ester. In contrast, MPLA, lipid X, and deacylated LPS failed to inhibit LPS-stimulated release of TNF. Corresponding to the inhibition of the release of TNF protein, lipid IVA also inhibited the accumulation of TNF mRNA in LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells. These results suggest that lipid IVA may act as a competitive antagonist of LPS, perhaps at the receptor level.
3 Antibody-dependent antitumor cytotoxicity by human monocytes cultured with recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Induction of efficient antibody-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity not detected by isotope release assays. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is known to stimulate proliferation of monocyte/macrophage progenitors and enhance in vitro antitumor cytotoxicity by murine macrophages. In this paper we have shown that recombinant human M-CSF causes human peripheral blood monocytes to differentiate in culture into metabolically active macrophage-like cells. These cells mediate very efficient antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against human melanoma and neuroblastoma cell lines in the presence of two murine IgG3 mAbs (3F8 and R24). They also mediate antibody-independent cytotoxicity (or cytostasis) to a lesser extent. Human serum had an inconsistent effect on ADCC, but often induced similar high levels of ADCC. Cytotoxicity was measured using a novel ELISA to detect surviving tumor cells after ADCC. Two conventional isotope-release assays (51Cr and [3H]TdR) underestimated or entirely failed to detect ADCC by M-CSF-activated monocytes. Optimal activation occurred with 100-300 U/ml of M-CSF, and required 9-11 d for completion. Most of the M-CSF cultured monocytes expressed the low-affinity Fc receptor (CD16). ADCC by cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage using murine IgG3 mAbs may have significance for the immunotherapy of human malignancies.
3 Regulation by the H-2 gene complex of macrophage-lymphoid cell interactions in secondary antibody responses in vitro. The ability of antigen-bearing syngeneic and allogeneic peptone-induced peritoneal exudate macrophages to support development of primary and secondary antibody responses by murine lymphoid or spleen cells in vitro has been investigated. The antigen used was the terpolymer of L-glutamic acid60-L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10 (GAT). Syngeneic and allogeneic macrophages supported development of comparable primary antibody responses to GAT, indicating that genetic restrictions do not limit efficient macrophage-lymphocyte interactions in primary responses. By contrast, immunized spleen or lymphoid cells developed secondary antibody responses preferentially when stimulated in vitro with GAT on macrophages syngeneic to the macrophages used to present GAT during in vivo immunization. Thus, genetic restrictions regulate efficient macrophage-lymphocyte interactions in secondary antibody responses. These restrictions have been demonstrated from 2 to 8 wk after a single immunization with limiting quantities of GAT and are controlled by the H-2 gene complex. The implications that immune lymphocytes selectively recognize and respond to antigen presented in the context of the macrophage membrane-antigen complex which sensitized the lymphocytes initially are considered.
2 Antibody raised against soluble CD4-rgp120 complex recognizes the CD4 moiety and blocks membrane fusion without inhibiting CD4-gp120 binding. We studied the humoral response of mice immunized with soluble CD4-rgp120 complex, testing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the aim of identifying molecular changes that take place after the first interaction between human immunodeficiency virus and the cell surface. The antisera had a paradoxically high syncytia-blocking titer associated with anti-CD4 specificity, while their capacity to inhibit CD4-gp120 binding was relatively modest. One of the mAbs produced from these responders blocks syncytia formation but does not inhibit CD4 interaction with gp120. Apparently, this mAb interacts with the CD4 moiety of CD4-gp120 complex and prevents a post-binding event necessary for membrane fusion and viral infection.
3 Membrane distribution and adsorptive endocytosis by C3b receptors on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. C3b receptors on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were nonrandomly distributed in small clusters on the plasma membranes of these cells when assessed by indirect immunofluorescence at 0 degree C using monospecific rabbit Fab' or F(ab')2 anti-C3b receptor and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat IgG anti-F(ab')2. When PMN were incubated with the bivalent anti-C3b receptor at 37 rather than at 0 degree C, almost no immunofluorescence was observed, which indicates that the C3b receptor-F(ab')2 complexes had been rendered inaccessible to TRITC-IgG anti-F(ab')2. Endocytosis of the anti-C3b receptor ligand was quantitated by measuring the binding 131I-IgG anti-F(ab')2 by PMN that had previously taken up 125I-F(ab')2 anti-C3b receptor at 0 and at 37 degree C, respectively. There was a constant 2: 1 molar ratio of anti-F(ab')2 to anti-C3b receptor with PMN that had been incubated with the first antibody at 0 degree C. In contrast, when increments of F(ab')2 anti-C3b receptor were taken up by the cells at 37 degree C, there was a dose-related decline in this molar ratio to a minimum of 0.2 molecules of anti-F(ab')2 anti-F(ab')2 bound per molecule of PMN-associated anti-C3b receptor. 125I-F(ab')2 anti-C3b receptor taken up by PMN at 37 degree C was also inaccessible to release by proteolytic treatment of the cells with pronase. The rate of endocytosis of 125I-F(ab')2 anti-C3b receptor was rapid as the PMN-bound antibody fragment became inaccessible to 131I-IgG anti-F(ab')2 within 10 min during incubation of the cells at 37 degree C. In contrast to these findings, 125I-Fab' anti-C3b receptor that was taken up by PMN at 37 degree C remained accessible to both 131I-IgG anti-F(ab')2 and to proteolytic release by pronase, which suggests that monovalent interaction of ligand with C3b receptors was not sufficient for induction of endocytosis. The requirement for multivalency was also demonstrated using the C3b-OR, the normal ligand for the C3b receptor. 125I-C3b-OR was specifically bound by PMN but remained on the cell receptor. 125I-C3b-OR was specifically bound by PMN but remained on the cell surface, as determined by its accessibility to pronase, unless it was cross-linked with F(ab')2 anti-C3. Although C3b receptors on PMN do not mediate internalization of adsorptive pinocytosis of soluble ligand indicates their potential for the clearance of C3b-bearing immune complexes without recruitment of other cell surface receptors.
3 Soluble factor requirements for the autostimulatory growth of B lymphoblasts immortalized by Epstein-Barr virus. B lymphoblasts immortalized by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) exhibit autocrine growth stimulation--that is they release a soluble activity to which they respond by growth. A minimally supplemented serum-free medium conditioned by lymphoblastoid cells in their log phase of growth (LCL-CM) was found to contain autostimulatory activity allowing us to explore the mechanism of autocrine growth for these cell-types in defined conditions. Below cell densities capable of supporting autonomous growth, continued proliferation in serum-free medium was dependent on both added LCL-CM and transferrin. Neither activity alone was capable of sustaining growth. At higher cell densities, transferrin by itself was sufficient to maintain the autocrine loop. The action of the autostimulatory factor appeared to reside in its ability to prime cells continually for a proliferative response to transferrin by enhancing the expression of transferrin receptors at the lymphoblast surfaces. The implications of these findings for normal B cell physiology and their possible relation to oncogenesis are discussed.
2 Histocompatibility studies in a closely bred colony of dogs. V. Mechanisms of cellular adaptation in long-term DL-A identical radiation chimeras. 20 Cooperstown beagles of known DL-A genotypes (B" dogs) were exposed to supralethal total body irradiation and received a bone marrow allograft from a DL-A identical donor (A" dog); the resulting chimeras have survived uneventfully for 882, 1466 days, with no evidence of secondary disease, and have been tolerant to kidney and skin allografts obtained from the donor of marrow. Treatment of "A" dogs with serum obtained from their long-term "B" chimeras had no significant effect upon the ability of the recipients to reject "B" skin allografts...
3 Phenotypic changes of bone marrow-derived mast cells after intraperitoneal transfer into W/Wv mice that are genetically deficient in mast cells. The ability of mouse IL-3-dependent, bone marrow culture-derived mast cells (BMMC) to generate serosal mast cells (SMC) in vivo after adoptive transfer to mast cell-deficient mice has been defined by chemical and immunochemical criteria. BMMC differentiated and grown from WBB6F1-+/+ mouse progenitor cells in medium containing PWM/splenocyte-conditioned medium synthesized a approximately 350,000 Mr protease-resistant proteoglycan bearing approximately 55,000 Mr glycosaminoglycans, as defined by gel filtration of each. Approximately 85% of the glycosaminoglycans bound to the cell-associated BMMC proteoglycans were chondroitin sulfates based upon their susceptibility to chondroitinase ABC digestion; HPLC of the chondroitinase ABC-generated unsaturated disaccharides revealed these glycosaminoglycans to be chondroitin sulfate E. As determined by heparinase and nitrous acid degradations, approximately 10% of the glycosaminoglycans bound to BMMC proteoglycans were heparin. In contrast, mast cells recovered from the peritoneal cavity of congenitally mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice 15 wk after intraperitoneal injection of BMMC synthesized approximately 650,000 Mr protease-resistant proteoglycans that contained approximately 80% heparin glycosaminoglycans of approximately 105,000 Mr. Thus, after adoptive transfer, the SMC of the previously mast cell-deficient mice were like those recovered from the normal WBB6F1-+/+ mice that were shown to synthesize approximately 600,000 Mr proteoglycans that contained approximately 80% heparin glycosaminoglycans of approximately 115,000 Mr. As assessed by indirect immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry using the B1.1 rat mAb (an antibody that recognizes an epitope located on the neutral glycosphingolipid globopentaosylceramide), approximately 5% of BMMC bound the antibody detectably, whereas approximately 72% of the SMC that were harvested from mast cell-deficient mice 15 wk after adoptive transfer of BMMC were B1.1-positive; approximately 82% of SMC from WBB6F1-+/+ mice bound the antibody. These biochemical and immunochemical data are consistent with the results of previous adoptive transfer studies that characterized mast cells primarily on the basis of morphologic and histochemical criteria. Thus, IL-3-dependent BMMC developed in vitro, cells that resemble mucosal mast cells, can give rise in vivo to SMC that express phenotypic characteristics of connective tissue mast cells.
3 Fetal antigens on the surface of human lymphoid cells. Human B-lymphoblastoid cells established in long-term culture from healthy adults carry surface components that are normally found in human fetal tissues at about 10 wk of age. These antigens are strongly expressed on neoplastic B lymphocytes but not on thymocytes or a cultured T-cell line. They are carried by a small subpopulation of normal adult peripheral blood lymphocytes as well.
1 Normal mouse peritoneum contains a large population of Ly-1+ (CD5) B cells that recognize phosphatidyl choline. Relationship to cells that secrete hemolytic antibody specific for autologous erythrocytes. We have found that, in the peritoneums of normal adult mice, 5-15% of lymphocytes bind a fluorescent liposome probe. In ontogeny, cells with this specificity were shown to appear by 8 d after birth, and increase to the adult frequency by 2-3 wk. Some older mice contain an expanded population of these cells. We have shown that liposome binding occurs by cell surface IgM recognizing the common membrane phospholipid, phosphatidyl choline (PtC). Virtually all of these PtC-specific cells bear the cell surface marker Ly-1. Our results indicate that roughly 1 in 10 peritoneal Ly-1+ B cells has this single specificity. We have found that the precursors to all the cells that form plaques on protease-treated autologous erythrocytes (BrMRBC) are included in the PtC-specific population and can be isolated by FACS. We believe this is the first report of sorting large numbers of B cells with a single antigen specificity from normal, unimmunized animals. This method will allow for in vitro and in vivo studies of differentiative and proliferative properties of Ly-1+ B cells, which may help define their role in development and disease.
2 Antigenic variation of Borrelia hermsii. At least 24 different serotypes were detected in populations of Borrelia hermsii that originated from a single organism. These serotypes were identified by staining with specific fluoresceinated antisera prepared against cloned populations of living organisms of each type. In the order of decreasing frequency, the 10 types more often encountered were 7, which was clearly dominant, and 2, 17, 24, 13, 2, 1, 21, 11, and 12. Each of the 24 types were shown to change to 7 or more other serotypes. Spirochetemia in mice was persistent, and relapses occurred when the concentration of organisms was sufficient for detection by visual means. After mice were inoculated with a single organism, peak spirochetemia usually occurred on day 4, after which clearance of organisms occurred, and an apparently pure population was replaced by a mixed population consisting of as many as seven variants. These types persisted for 2-3 d before being replaced by other types. Conversions occurred constantly and were independent of relapses. The rate of conversion in mice treated with cyclophosphamide to delay antibody production was comparable to that of controls. Spontaneous conversion was clearly demonstrated in tubes of fortified Kelly's medium inoculated with a single organism of type 7 or 21. 11 different variants appeared in eight cultures of type 21 by the time growth had reached 4 X 10(6)-10(7) organisms/ml. The rate of spontaneous change was estimated to be or approximately 10(-4)-10(-3) per cell per generation.
3 B cell stimulating factor 2/interleukin 6 is a costimulant for human thymocytes and T lymphocytes. Growth and differentiation of thymocytes and mature T lymphocytes is regulated by cellular interactions that are in part mediated by soluble factors. We identify IL-6, formerly called B cell stimulating factor (BSF-2). IFN-beta 2, or hybridoma-plasmacytoma growth factor (HPGF) as a novel T cell costimulant rIL-6 induced a six-to seven-fold increase in proliferation of human thymocytes stimulated with suboptimal doses of PHA. A similar effect with added IL-6 could be observed using peripheral blood T lymphocytes, but only if the cultures were first rigorously depleted of monocytes that release high levels of IL-6. Analysis of the mechanism of the IL-6 effect on thymocytes and T lymphocytes showed that IL-6 did not lead to an increase in IL-2-R expression. Concentrations of antibody to IL-2-R inhibiting IL-2 effects did not block the IL-6-induced proliferation, indicating that the IL-6 effect was relatively IL-2 independent. These results identify IL-6 as a novel costimulant of human thymocytes and mature T lymphocytes, and suggest that IL-6 is also an important regulatory of cellular immunity.
3 Negative regulation of the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway by presenilin 1. Presenilin 1 (PS1) plays a pivotal role in Notch signaling and the intracellular metabolism of the amyloid beta-protein. To understand intracellular signaling events downstream of PS1, we investigated in this study the action of PS1 on mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Overexpressed PS1 suppressed the stress-induced stimulation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Interestingly, two functionally inactive PS1 mutants, PS1(D257A) and PS1(D385A), failed to inhibit UV-stimulated SAPK/JNK. Furthermore, H(2)O(2-) or UV-stimulated SAPK activity was higher in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells from PS1-null mice than in MEF cells from PS(+/+) mice. MEF(PS1(-/-)) cells were more sensitive to the H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis than MEF(PS1(+/+)) cells. Ectopic expression of PS1 in MEF(PS1(-/-)) cells suppressed H(2)O(2)-stimulated SAPK/JNK activity and apoptotic cell death. Together, our data suggest that PS1 inhibits the stress-activated signaling by suppressing the SAPK/JNK pathway.
3 Subcellular localization of the PGE2 synthesis activity in mouse resident peritoneal macrophages. The aim of this work was to establish, on a quantitative basis, the subcellular distribution of the enzyme system that converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandin (PG) E2 in mouse resident peritoneal (MRP) macrophages. Kinetic studies were conducted on cell-free extracts derived from cells cultivated for 1 d, using [1-14C]arachidonic acid as substrate and measuring the label in PGE2 after extraction and thin layer chromatography. The activity was synergistically enhanced by L-adrenaline and reduced glutathione, inhibited by indomethacin, and linearly related to the concentration of the cell-free extract. It was labile at 0 degrees C in the medium used for homogenization and fractionation of the cells (half-life less than 2 h). Addition of catalase (0.15 mg/ml) to the suspension medium increased the initial activity (by congruent to 70%) and the stability (half-life congruent to 6 h) of the enzyme in cytoplasmic extracts. It enabled us to establish the density distribution after isopycnic centrifugation in a linear gradient of sucrose. The sample centrifuged consisted of untreated cytoplasmic extracts, or cytoplasmic extracts treated with digitonin and Na pyrophosphate. Comparison of the centrifugation behavior of PGE2 synthesis activity with that of various enzymes used as reference for the major subcellular entities has revealed that PGE2 synthesis fairly fits the density profile of sulfatase C in each case. The conclusion is that at least the rate-limiting reaction in the conversion of arachidonic acid into PGE2 is catalyzed by an enzyme associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.
3 Interleukin 4 promotes the growth of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes cytotoxic for human autologous melanoma. Addition of IL-4 (1,000 U/ml) to either high or low concentrations of IL-2 augmented tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) growth from human melanoma. Weekly restimulation with irradiated tumor cells in conjunction with IL-4 allowed enhanced growth of TIL. With low-dose IL-2 (10 U/ml) and IL-4, expanded TIL had little cytolytic activity against Daudi or allogeneic tumors. Further, IL-4 augmented the total lytic activity against autologous tumors in most cases. With high-dose IL-2 (1,000 U/ml), IL-4 addition decreased nonspecific killing activity against Daudi or allogeneic melanomas in many cases, and reciprocally augmented cytolytic activity against the autologous melanoma in many cases. This suggests the possible use of IL-4 in cancer therapy, especially in adoptive cellular immunotherapy using TIL or in conjunction with IL-2 administration.
0 Restricted immunoglobulin junctional diversity in neonatal B cells results from developmental selection rather than homology-based V(D)J joining. The mechanism by which coding ends are joined during immunoglobulin (Ig) recombination is poorly understood. Recently, short sequence similarities (2-6 bp) observed at the ends of certain variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments of Ig have been correlated with limited junctional diversity observed in coding exons assembled from these elements. However, it is unclear whether these sequence homologies play any direct role in favoring coding joint formation by influencing the V(D)J recombination process. In this report, we demonstrate that coding sequence similarities do not influence the position of coding joints during V(D)J recombination in vivo. Instead, during embryonic development, B cells with certain joining products undergo progressive selection. Developmental selection is completed before exposure to external antigens and appears to be determined by the amino acid sequence encoded by the coding joint. We conclude that the nucleotide sequences of the coding regions do not play a major role in directing V(D)J recombination. Instead, we propose that limited Ig junctional diversity results from prenatal developmental selection of B cells based on the protein sequence of their surface Ig antigen-binding site. Sequence identities at the ends of coding segments may have evolved because they increase the likelihood that a selectable antigen-binding site is created during a random recombination process.
3 Thymic hormone-containing cells. Characterization and localization of serum thymic factor in young mouse thymus studied by monoclonal antibodies. The characterization and distribution of cells containing the serum thymic factor (FTS) in the thymus of young mice was studied by immunofluorescence using monoclonal anti-FTS antibodies. FTS+ cells were distributed throughout the thymic parenchyma but were more frequent in the medullary region than in the cortex. FTS-containing cells presented a stellate or globular aspect, and some of them exhibited fluorescent cytoplasmic granules. The epithelial nature of FTS+ cells was confirmed by double-labeling experiments using an anti-keratin antiserum (as an epithelial cell marker). Nevertheless, only a minority of keratin-positive epithelial reticular cells contained FTS. All controls, including the incubation of sections from nonthymic tissues with the anti-FTS antibodies, were negative. Taken together, these results confirm the exclusive localization of FTS-containing cells within the mouse thymus.
3 Interleukin 4 (B cell stimulatory factor 1) can mediate the induction of lymphokine-activated killer cell activity directed against fresh tumor cells. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) expresses multiple biologic activities, including B cell, mast cell, and T cell stimulation. We showed that the incubation of resting splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice solely in purified native or recombinant mouse IL-4 results in the generation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity directed against fresh, syngeneic sarcoma cells. The precursor activated by IL-4 expresses surface asialo-GM1. In addition, IL-4 is capable of amplifying the splenic LAK activity induced by recombinant IL-2. The generation, by IL-4, of killer cells with broad antitumor reactivity raises the possibility of using IL-4 alone or in combination with IL-2 in the immunotherapy of cancer in animal models.
1 Differentiation-stage specific self-peptides bound by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. We have tested the hypothesis that phenotypic changes of development are accompanied by expression of differentiation-stage specific peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The U937 cell line, when cultured in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), undergoes differentiation from monoblasts to macrophage-like cells. The high-performance liquid chromatography profile of peptides eluted from purified human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen class I molecules expressed by U937 treated with PMA differs from that obtained from control, untreated U937 cells. Chemical sequencing of eluted peptides identified a peptide derived from cytomegalovirus in both treated and untreated cells. PMA-treated, but not untreated cells, displayed an additional peptide derived from interleukin 1 beta. Hence, differentiation-induction of U937 is accompanied by the presentation of at least one differentiation-stage specific peptide. Our results indicate that, similar to viral infection, cellular development and transformation is accompanied by the de novo synthesis of proteins which are processed and presented on MHC class I molecules.
2 Linkage between the frequency of muscular weakness and loci that regulate immune responsiveness in murine experimental myasthenia gravis. Mice immunized with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) purified from Torpedo californica form anti-AChR antibodies and often develop muscular weakness and flaccid paralysis closely resembling the human disease myasthenia gravis. This condition, termed experimental myasthenia gravis (EMG), is strain dependent in that the frequency of paralysis is much greater in some strains than in others. Differences in the frequency of EMG might result from differences in the immune system or the neuromuscular junction. In these studies, we have identified two loci, the major histocompatibility complex (H-2) region on chromosome 17 and the region that contains the structural genes for the constant region of immunoglobulin heavy chains (IgCH region) on chromosome 12, which significantly effect the probability with which a mouse immunized with T. californica AChR can be expected to become paralyzed. One genotype (H-2b, Ig-1b) correlated with high susceptibility to EMG in four strains with three dissimilar backgrounds. These studies demonstrate that susceptibility to EMG is a heritable trait determined by at least two distinct loci that are linked to regions of the mouse genome that regulate immune responsiveness.
0 Restricted replication of lentiviruses. Visna viruses induce a unique interferon during interaction between lymphocytes and infected macrophages. Lentivirus infections are characterized by a persistent, restricted type of virus replication in tissues. Using sheep and goat lentiviruses, whose target cells in vivo are macrophages, we explored virus-host cell interactions to determine whether an interferon (IFN) is produced during virus replication in vivo which causes restricted replication. We show that the lentiviruses were incapable of inducing IFN directly in any infected cell, including macrophages and lymphocytes. However, after infection with these viruses, sheep and goat macrophages acquired a factor that triggered IFN production by T lymphocytes. Only sheep/goat lentiviruses were capable of inducing the factor and, although these viruses replicated productively in various cell cultures of the natural host animal, only infected macrophages developed the IFN-inducing factor. The factor was produced continuously and was strictly cell associated, requiring direct contact with lymphocytes. The lymphocytes responded with a single, sudden release of IFN beginning 7 h after cocultivation and reaching peak values at 48 h, after which they ceased production and became refractory. IFN production was not immunologically specific and did not require histocompatibility between donors of the two cell types. The IFN is a nonglycosylated protein of molecular weight 54,000-64,000, and is stable to heat and acid treatments. These findings identify a unique IFN and a new method for virus induction of IFN. The novel two-stage process of induction provides a mechanism for local amplification and continuity of production of IFN in vivo. This is compatible with infection in the animal whose lentivirus-induced pathologic lesions consist of accumulations of lymphocytes and infected macrophages in target tissues.
3 Age-dependent deficiency of B lymphocyte lineage precursors in NZB mice. Adult NZB mice (greater than 15 wk old) have very few bone marrow cells that can give rise to sIg+ clonable B cells during liquid culture. This deficiency corresponds to extremely low numbers of cells with cytoplasmic but not surface mu chains of IgM and reduced numbers of cells bearing a high molecular weight B-lineage antigen. Depletion of Thy-1-bearing cells and appropriate mixing experiments did not provide evidence either that suppressor cells are responsible for this phenomenon or that accessory cells are defective in NZB mice. Nor did it seem that B cells were being produced in extramedullary sites. B cell precursors were detectable in very young NZB mice, exceeded control values at 4-5 wk of age, and then declined rapidly. In contrast, these persisted for greater than 1 yr in normal BALB/c, DBA/2, and CBA/H mice. It appears possible that intermediate stages in B-lineage differentiation become prematurely exhausted through an accelerated aging process in NZB mice. These chronological changes have implications for understanding the sequence of events that lead to B lymphocyte formation and the processes that normally regulate it.
3 Tumor necrosis factor-mediated release of platelet-derived growth factor from cultured endothelial cells. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a 30,000-Mr glycoprotein that is chemotactic and mitogenic for vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). It is also a potent vasoconstrictor. In the present study, we found that the macrophage-derived polypeptide, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), releases a factor from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) that is mitogenic for SMC. Postculture medium from TNF-stimulated EC induced a 90% increase in mitogenesis is compared with controls. This effect was half-maximal at a TNF dose of 114 pM, reflected a 2.5-fold increase in PDGF-specific mRNA synthesis, and peaked at 15 h of TNF stimulation. Mitogenic activity was completely abrogated by preincubation of postculture medium with antibody to platelet PDGF. Stimulation of EC with IL-1 (60-240 pM) led to the release of similar mitogenic activity. Thus, in addition to its effects on the hemostatic and adhesive properties of EC, TNF also promotes release of PDGF, which may serve to modulate proliferation of vascular SMC during wound healing, inflammation, and atherogenesis.
3 Rearrangement of immune complexes in glomeruli leads to persistence and development of electron-dense deposits. Covalently, cross-linked immune complexes were prepared with multivalent 2-nitro-4-azidophenyl X human serum albumin (NAP X HSA) and antibodies to NAP at five times antigen excess. After purification with gel filtration, affinity chromatography with antigen-agarose column, and addition of the hapten, 9.5% of the antibodies dissociated from the complexes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. After injection of these cross-linked immune complexes into mice, glomeruli stained for the complexes by immunofluorescence microscopy for only a few hours and electron-dense deposits were not detected. In contrast, when the same immune complexes with comparable lattice but without covalent cross-linking were administered to a second group of mice, the initial deposition by immunofluorescence was comparable and then increased to extensive deposits that persisted to 96 h. In this second group of mice extensive electron-dense deposits evolved. These observations supported the conclusion that the immune complexes initially deposited from circulation must undergo rearrangement to persist and to form electron-dense deposits in glomeruli. The covalently cross-linked immune complexes existed in glomeruli only for a short period of time since these complexes could not rearrange.
3 Preferential nuclear compartmentalization of endogenous mink cell focus-forming-related retroviral transcripts. Endogenous mink cell focus-forming (MCF)-like retroviral sequences in the murine genome are stable, inherited sequences analogous to other chromosomal genes. As such, it is thought that they are transcribed and translated in a manner analogous to other genes. However, when the SL12.4 CD4-, CD8- thymoma cell line was studied for nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of endogenous MCF-related transcripts, there was a nuclear predominance. The great majority of full-length 8.4-kb endogenous MCF-related transcripts were nuclear. Even the smaller, spliced 3.0-kb transcripts were at least as prominent in the nucleus as the cytoplasm, whereas cellular RNA was 80% cytoplasmic and other cellular transcripts were represented in the cytoplasm to a much greater extent than the nucleus. Size cannot fully account for the nuclear presence of MCF-related endogenous transcripts, because the 3.0-kb MCF transcripts occurred in the nucleus to a much greater relative extent than 3.8-kb c-myb transcripts. These studies point to retroviral-like structures of these transcripts as influencing their intracellular compartmentalization.
3 T and B cell in hapten-specific carrier-determined tolerance. BDF1 mice were made tolerant by a single i.v. injection of 1 mg of DNAP-gamma1 or by weekly i.v. injections of 0.2 mg of DNP-gamma1 given for a month. In both instances, spleen cells of tolerant animals were fractionated to obtain pure populations of T cells (nonimmunoglobulin-bearing cells), referred to as tolerant T cells, and B cells (immunoglobulin-bearing cells) referred to as tolerant B cells (immunoglobulin-bearing cells) referred to as tolerant B cells. The control cells were similarly fractionated to obtain normal T and B cells. Mixtures of tolerant T cells and normal B cells, or conversely, normal T cells and tolerant B cells were used to repopulate lethally irradiated recipients. These recipients were then immunized with dinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet haemocyanin and in certain instances with other antigen horse red blood cells. The immune response to both antigens was measured using the direct hemolytic plaque assay. It was found that both T and B cells were tolerant and that tolerance was hapten specific at both T- and B-cell levels. While B-cell tolerance was demonstrated at a 1/1 T/B ratio, a 4/1 T/B ratio was necessary to show T-cell tolerance. Thus, the hapten-specific carrier-determined tolerance involves not only B cells but also T cells. The implication of this finding for the cellular mechanism of tolerance in an experimental model closely related to self tolerance is discussed.
2 Tracing of cells of the avian thymus through embryonic life in interspecific chimeras. Differences in the structure of the interphase nucleus between two species of birds, the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and the chick (Gallus gallus) has been used to distinguish cells from different origins in interspecies combinations. This biological cell marking technique was applied to thymus histogenesis. Using various combinations between components of quail and chick thymic rudiments, the respective contribution of endodermal epithelium, mesenchyme, and blood-borne extrinsic elements to the histogenesis of thymus was analyzed. It was demonstrated that the whole lymphoid population of the thymus is derived from immigrant blood-borne stem cells which are chemically attracted by the endoderm of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouch. The latter is determined to differentiate into thymic epithelial reticulum as soon as the 15-somite stage, and is able to attract blood stem cells even when transplanted in an heterotopic position such as the ventral body wall of the embryo. It was shown that the thymic mesenchyme originates from the neural crest mesectoderm which colonizes early the 3rd and 4th branchial arches. It participates in the formation of perivascular mesenchyme, but does not give rise to lymphocytes. From heterospecific transplantations of quail thymuses into chick embryo (and inversely) at various stages of development is appeared that the thymic rudiment becomes attractive for lymphoid stem cells at a precise stage of its evolution for each species. The attractivity period lasts about 24 h for the quail and 36 h for the chick. Then, the inflow of stem cells becomes very low until the end of the incubation period. At this time, a second wave of lymphocytoblasts invades the thymus and the primitive embryonic lymphoid population is completely renewed around the hatching time. Competent thymic stem cells are present in the blood before and after the period of physiological thymic attractivity. The identity of basophilic cells appearing in the thymus during its histogenesis and lymphoid stem cells has been demonstrated from the analysis of quail-chick chimeric thymuses.
1 Epstein-Barr virus transformation induces B lymphocytes to produce human interleukin 10. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic factor that enhances proliferation of activated human B lymphocytes and induces them to secrete high amounts of immunoglobulins. Here we show that several human B cell lines were able to constitutively secrete human (h)IL-10. Whereas none of the pre-B nor the plasmocytic cell lines tested produced hIL-10, 25 of the 36 tested mature B cell lines (lymphoblastoid and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines) secreted hIL-10. Moreover, 24 of these 25 hIL-10-producing B cell lines contained the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome, suggesting a relationship between hIL-10 production by human B cell lines and EBV expression. Accordingly, whereas polyclonal activation via triggering of surface immunoglobulins or CD40 antigen induced highly purified normal human B lymphocytes to produce only low (0.3-0.4 ng/ml) but significant amounts of hIL-10, EBV infection induced them to secrete high amounts of hIL-10 (4-9 ng/ml). Furthermore, addition of exogenous hIL-10, simultaneously to EBV infection, potentiated cell proliferation, whereas a blocking anti-IL-10 antiserum inhibited it. Thus, hIL-10 produced by infected human B lymphocytes appears to be involved in the mechanisms of EBV-induced B cell proliferation.
3 Aggresomes resemble sites specialized for virus assembly. The large cytoplasmic DNA viruses such as poxviruses, iridoviruses, and African swine fever virus (ASFV) assemble in discrete perinuclear foci called viral factories. Factories exclude host proteins, suggesting that they are novel subcellular structures induced by viruses. Novel perinuclear structures, called aggresomes are also formed by cells in response to misfolded protein (Johnston, J.A., C.L. Ward, and R.R. Kopito. 1998. J. Cell Biol. 143:1883--1898; García-Mata, R., Z. Bebök, E.J. Sorscher, and E.S. Sztul. 1999. J. Cell Biol. 146:1239--1254). In this study, we have investigated whether aggresomes and viral factories are related structures. Aggresomes were compared with viral factories produced by ASFV. Aggresomes and viral factories were located close to the microtubule organizing center and required an intact microtubular network for assembly. Both structures caused rearrangement of intermediate filaments and the collapse of vimentin into characteristic cages, and both recruited mitochondria and cellular chaperones. Given that ASFV factories resemble aggresomes, it is possible that a cellular response originally designed to reduce the toxicity of misfolded proteins is exploited by cytoplasmic DNA viruses to concentrate structural proteins at virus assembly sites.
3 Adenosine promotes neutrophil chemotaxis. We have previously (1-4) demonstrated that adenosine, by engaging specific receptors on the surface of neutrophils, inhibits generation of toxic oxygen metabolites by activated neutrophils and prevents these activated neutrophils from injuring endothelial cells. We now report the surprising observation that engagement of these same neutrophil adenosine receptors promotes chemotaxis to C5 fragments (as zymosan-activated plasma [ZAP]) or to the bacterial chemoattractant FMLP. When chemotaxis was studied in a modified Boyden chamber, physiologic concentrations of adenosine promoted chemotaxis by as much as 60%. Adenosine receptor analogues, 5'N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA), also promoted chemotaxis; the order of agonist potency was consistent with that of an A2 adenosine receptor (NECA greater than PIA greater than or equal to adenosine). A potent antagonist at adenosine receptors, 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline (10 microM), completely reversed NECA enhancement of chemotaxis but did not affect chemotaxis by itself. Neither NECA nor 2-chloroadenosine, a nonselective adenosine receptor agonist, alone was chemotactic or chemokinetic by checkerboard analysis. NECA also promoted chemotaxis quantitated by a different technique, chemotaxis under agarose, to the surrogate bacterial chemoattractant FMLP. These data suggest that engagement of adenosine A2 receptors uniquely modulates neutrophil function so as to promote migration of neutrophils to sites of tissue damage while preventing the neutrophils from injuring healthy tissues en route.
2 Epidermal proliferation of nude mouse skin, pig skin, and pig skin grafts. Failure of nude mouse skin to respond to the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate. Human skin transplanted to nude mice offers a possible experimental system for the study of normal epidermal proliferation and differentiation, and for their pathological counterparts. Crucial to the development of such a system is the demonstration that such grafts retain the responsive features of donor skin. To document that donor proliferative characteristics are maintained in the grafts, a comparative analysis of agents that induce proliferation was made on skin of mice homozygous and heterozygous for nude, on pig skin, and on pig skin transplanted onto nude mice. A wave of epidermal proliferation could be induced in pig skin and pig skin grafted onto nude mice, but not in nude mouse skin after the topical application of 10 ng 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). A 10-fold greater concentration of TPA or 5% croton oil induced proliferation in all species of epidermis studied. Mice, heterozygous for nude, showed a normal response to 10 ng TPA, suggesting that the ability to respond to TPA may be related, in part, to a recessive genetic trait. Nude mouse skin transplanted to a heterozygous littermate capable of responding to 10 ng TPA does not respond. These observations argue that: the graft retains its donor proliferative characteristics when transplanted to the nude, and the inability of the nude mouse to respond to lower doses of TPA may be related to absorption, the nude gene(s), or an inherent threshold to response. The lack of response to the promoter TPA provides a plausible explanation for the decreased incidence of tumors arising in nude mice during two-stage carcinogenesis experiments.
3 Actin bound to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hrp36 is associated with Balbiani ring mRNA from the gene to polysomes. In the salivary glands of the dipteran Chironomus tentans, a specific messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particle, the Balbiani ring (BR) granule, can be visualized during its assembly on the gene and during its nucleocytoplasmic transport. We now show with immunoelectron microscopy that actin becomes associated with the BR particle concomitantly with transcription and is present in the particle in the nucleoplasm. DNase I affinity chromatography experiments with extracts from tissue culture cells indicate that both nuclear and cytoplasmic actin are bound to the heterogeneous RNP (hnRNP) protein hrp36, but not to the hnRNP proteins hrp23 and hrp45. The interaction is likely to be direct as purified actin binds to recombinant hrp36 in vitro. Furthermore, it is demonstrated by cross linking that nuclear as well as cytoplasmic actin are bound to hrp36 in vivo. It is known that hrp36 is added cotranscriptionally along the BR mRNA molecule and accompanies the RNA through the nuclear pores and into polysomes. We conclude that actin is likely to be bound to the BR transcript via hrp36 during the transfer of the mRNA from the gene all the way into polysomes.
3 Cytolysis by Ca-permeable transmembrane channels. Pore formation causes extensive DNA degradation and cell lysis. This study investigates the effect of the purified membrane pore formers, staphylococcal alpha-toxin and CTL perforin, on target cell lysis as measured by 51Cr release and on nuclear damage as measured by DNA degradation and 125IUdR release. Both pore formers cause dose-dependent cell lysis, which is accompanied by DNA release. The ratio of DNA/Cr release depends on the nature of target cell and shows the same pattern as the ratio of release of the two markers reported for CTL-mediated lysis of the same targets. DNA degradation is dependent on the presence of intracellular Ca in the target cell and is totally blocked if Ca is chelated by Quin 2 intracellularly and EGTA extracellularly. DNA degradation, in addition, is inhibited by the lysosomotropic agents NH4Cl, chloroquine, and monensin. rTNF doubles the degree of DNA degradation mediated by alpha-toxin in 3-h assays. We conclude that pore formers alone can mediate DNA degradation. In addition, they may promote the uptake of other factors and thereby accelerate their time course of action. DNA degradation by pore formers requires active target participation in a pathway that is dependent on intracellular Ca and lysosomes. These aspects of target lysis resemble CTL- and NK cell-mediated cytolysis.
3 Localization of a molecule immunochemically similar to eosinophil major basic protein in human placenta. We have recently reported that human pregnancy is characterized by a 10- to 20-fold elevation of eosinophil major basic protein (MBP) immunoreactivity in maternal blood. Here we show, by immunofluorescence, that placental tissue specifically binds antibody to MBP in and around the placental X cells and placental-site giant cells and, using thin plastic sections, that placenta has no infiltrating eosinophils. The X cells line the inner aspects of placental septal cysts, and the cyst fluid, obtained by aspiration, contains immunoreactive MBP at concentrations of 100 micrograms/ml, a sixfold greater concentration than the highest levels measured in maternal blood. The soluble MBP immunoreactivities in placental homogenates and in maternal serum chromatograph identically on Sephadex G-50, and both these gestational MBP molecules migrate as though substantially larger than the MBP found in serum from patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome or purified from the eosinophil granule. Our inability to demonstrate eosinophils in maternal blood or placental tissue, coupled with the large quantities of immunoreactive MBP highly localized in placental cysts and the chromatographic behavior of this molecule, suggest that the MBP detected in human gestation is produced by placenta.
2 Systemic tolerance and secretory immunity after oral immunization. Diminished systemic immune reaction after ingestion of antigen has been reported in several animal models. Conversely, it has been reported recently that oral immunization may lead to the production of secretory antibodies. To determine whether these events could occur concurrently, CBA/J mice were immunized intragastrically with varying doses of ovalbumin (OVA) and Streptococcus mutans. After 7 d, the animals were challenged systemically with antigen in complete adjuvant and 8 d later serum and saliva taken, and the draining lymph nodes assayed for a proliferative response. Intragastric doses of 1 mg OVA or 10(9) S. mutans led to significant suppression of the proliferative response, and intragastric doses of 10 mg OVA or 2.5 X 10(9) S. mutans led to the production of detectable salivary antibodies using hemagglutination. Serum antibodies were not detected after intragastric administration of OVA or S. mutans. Suppression of the proliferative response could be detected from 2-60 d after intragastric administration of OVA, and 2-21 d after S. mutans. Prior intragastric immunization with heterologous antigens did not suppress the response to OVA or S. mutans. Transfer of 40 X 10(6) mesenteric lymph node cells from mice given 20 mg OVA or 10(9) S. mutans led to suppression of the proliferative response in syngeneic recipients. Salivary antibodies wer removed by absorption with anti-IgA, but not anti-IgG or IgM, indicating that they were of the IgA class. It appears that intragastric administration of soluble or particulate antigens in mice may lead to the concurrent induction of salivary antibodies and systemic suppression.
0 Consistent breakage between consensus recombinase heptamers of chromosome 9 DNA in a recurrent chromosomal translocation of human T cell leukemia. Chromosomal translocations in lymphoid tumors frequently result from recombination between a normally rearranging antigen receptor gene and a normally non-rearranging second locus. The possibility that the lymphocyte recombinase apparatus plays a role in determining the position of breakage at the second locus has been a matter of controversy because of the inconsistent presence of heptamer-like recognition sequences adjoining breakpoints at this site. To further investigate this issue, sites of DNA recombination were analyzed in both the der(9) and der(7) products of t(7;9)(q34;q32), a recurrent translocation of human acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL). In each of three separate cases, the translocation has divided the TCR-beta locus, juxtaposing chromosome 9 DNA 5' to a J-region in the der(9) product and 3' to a D-region in the der(7) product, with variably sized N-insertions and small deletions detectable at the junctions. All three cases contain breakpoints in chromosome 9 DNA tightly clustered between two closely spaced, and oppositely oriented heptamer sequences, CAC(A/T)GTG, which perfectly match the consensus heptamer sequence recognized by the lymphocyte recombinase apparatus in normal antigen receptor gene rearrangement. In no case was there evidence of directly duplicated sequences in the two reciprocal products, as is often associated with recombination involving random staggered breakage of DNA. Taken together, these results support a mechanism for this particular translocation proceeding by recombinase-mediated breakage of both participating chromosomes.
3 Developmentally regulated and strain-specific expression of murine VH gene families. We have devised a simple assay that provides an instantaneous representation of VH family usage in primary and peripheral lymphoid tissues. This assay lacks complex manipulations out of the animal and thus minimizes the risk of in vitro artifacts. We have used this assay to demonstrate a dramatic preference for utilization of the most JH-proximal VH segments in the newborn liver of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, we find that VH segments from across the entire VH locus are utilized early in development, but at frequencies directly related to their JH proximity. A major shift away from the position-dependent VH repertoire of the neonate is seen in unprimed or polyclonally-activated adult spleen cells, in which relative utilization of the various VH families is related to family size. We also report consistent strain-specific differences in the expression of certain VH families. Our data indicate that a position-dependent VH repertoire is generated in differentiating pre-B lymphocytes (probably reflecting constraints imposed by the immunoglobulin gene assembly process), and that mechanisms that operate subsequent to rearrangement then randomize this position-dependent repertoire in a strain-specific manner.
3 Histamine production during the anti-allograft response. Demonstration of a new lymphokine enhancing histamine synthesis. Histamine production is greatly increased during culture of allograft recipient spleen cells in the presence of immunizing cells (secondary mixed leukocyte cultures [MLC]) as compared to that found in primary MLC (i.e., without previous allograft). This phenomenon appears after 24 h of culture and reaches its maximum at 48 h. Optimal increased histamine production is observed when MLC is performed with spleen cells removed from mice during rejection. This increased production of histamine during secondary MLC results from the action of a lymphokine: the histamine-producing cell stimulating factor (HCSF). This factor is released by T lymphocytes. Its production requires specific stimulation of the recipient lymphocytes because increase in histamine production during secondary MLC can be only observed when recipient cells are cultured with stimulating cells bearing at least one homology at K or D loci with immunizing cells. HCSF acts on a cell which is present in bone marrow, spleen, blood, and peritoneal cells but absent in thymus or lymph node cells. This target cell is found in the less-dense layer of a discontinuous Ficoll-gradient of bone marrow cells. HCSF is heat stable, destroyed by trypsin treatment, and has a molecular weight between 50,000 and 100,000. It acts on its target cells by increasing histidine decarboxylase activity.
3 Size variation of the M protein in group A streptococci. In addition to the type-specific antigenic variation that is a well-known characteristic for the group A streptococcal M protein, we have now found that the M molecules vary with respect to their molecular size, both between M types and within an M type. By the use of an M6 monoclonal antibody, which crossreacts with 20 different M protein types, and antibodies to the N-acetyl glucosamine determinant of the cell wall, we have been able to identify the M protein molecules released from the streptococcal cell wall with muralytic enzymes, particularly group C phage-associated lysin. Immunoblot analysis of the cell extract identified M protein molecules bound to various cell wall fragments, suggesting a peptidoglycan linkage for the M molecule. M protein extracted from 20 different streptococcal serotypes revealed size variations from 41,000 to 80,000 in molecular weight. This extreme variation is unusual for related proteins. Similar size variations in the M molecule were also found in random clinical isolates of type 6 streptococci. No size change was seen in M6 protein isolated from: (a) strains within a limited epidemic, (b) a strain passaged in mice 192 times, and (c) a strain passaged in the laboratory for 156 generations, suggesting that the observed variation is not a rapid process. The results indicate that, within the broad limits observed in this study, the size of the M protein may not be critical to the antiphagocytic activity of the molecule.
3 Demonstration of a specific receptor for human C5a anaphylatoxin on murine macrophages. Human C5a anaphylatoxin is known to be a potent mediator of the acute inflammatory response. It serves to trigger a wide variety of neutrophil responses after binding to a specific cellular receptor. We have now demonstrated that this bioactive glycopolypeptide is also bound to a specific receptor found on murine resident peritoneal macrophages, thioglycollate-induced exudate macrophages, and the murine cell line P388D1. The apparent Kd of the C5a receptors. Resident macrophages appear to have an average of 2 x 10(5) binding sites per cell, whereas thioglycollate- induced cells have only 4-5 x 10(4) binding sites. The continuous cell line P388D1 is intermediate between these two cell types, exhibiting 8-10 x 10(4) C5a receptors per cell. Neither murine lymphocytes nor the parent cell line P388 displays a measurable number of C5a receptors. Macrophage receptor-C5a binding interactions are followed by cellular uptake and degradation of 125I-C5a, much as is observed with neutrophils. As demonstrated in another paper, binding of C5a to macrophages results in augmentation of the primary humoral immune response as well as enhancement of mixed lymphocyte reactions. These observations suggest that C5a should not only be considered as an acute inflammatory mediator but as an immunopotentiating modulator as well, thus serving as a critical link between complement activation and subsequent immune responses.
0 p53 regulates myogenesis by triggering the differentiation activity of pRb. The p53 oncosuppressor protein regulates cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis, but increasing evidence also indicates its involvement in differentiation and development. We had previously demonstrated that in the presence of differentiation-promoting stimuli, p53-defective myoblasts exit from the cell cycle but do not differentiate into myocytes and myotubes. To identify the pathways through which p53 contributes to skeletal muscle differentiation, we have analyzed the expression of a series of genes regulated during myogenesis in parental and dominant-negative p53 (dnp53)-expressing C2C12 myoblasts. We found that in dnp53-expressing C2C12 cells, as well as in p53(-/-) primary myoblasts, pRb is hypophosphorylated and proliferation stops. However, these cells do not upregulate pRb and have reduced MyoD activity. The transduction of exogenous TP53 or Rb genes in p53-defective myoblasts rescues MyoD activity and differentiation potential. Additionally, in vivo studies on the Rb promoter demonstrate that p53 regulates the Rb gene expression at transcriptional level through a p53-binding site. Therefore, here we show that p53 regulates myoblast differentiation by means of pRb without affecting its cell cycle-related functions.
3 Human monoclonal anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin antibody-secreting hybridoma produced from peripheral blood B lymphocytes of a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-immune individual. A human IgMk monoclonal antibody, 2F7, of predetermined specificity, has been produced by the fusion of human peripheral blood lymphocytes with the nonsecreting mouse myeloma line SP-1. The heterohybridoma has remained stable for over 8 mo, with culture supernatants containing up to 30 micrograms/ml of specific IgM. The antibody has been shown to be capable of inducing a blastogenic response in the absence of antigen in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal subjects immune to the antigen. The ability to choose an antigen, immunize a human subject to that antigen, and then use the peripheral blood lymphocytes from that subject to produce antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies should be of great value in a wide variety of investigative, diagnostic, and therapeutic endeavors.U
3 Modulation of Tthy alloantigen expression in the neonatal mouse. The Tthy-bearing thymocyte is a precursor for the peripheral cells expressing Tind and Tsu. The T cell alloantigen Tthyd appears on a subpopulation of thymocytes in mice bearing the Igh-1d or e heavy chain haplotype. Ontogenetic studies have suggested that this antigen precedes the appearance of two other T cell alloantigens in the same linkage group, Tindd and Tsud. The purpose of this study was to determine if the Tthy-bearing cell is a precursor for cells in the periphery expressing Tind and Tsu. CAL-20 mice were treated at 48-h intervals beginning on the day of birth with a monoclonal antibody recognizing Tthy. Tthy alloantigen expression, monitored by cytotoxicity assays, was found to be significantly depressed in the thymuses of treated animals; Tind and Tsu also failed to appear in the periphery. Treatment with anti-Tthy caused no significant changes in frequency or surface intensity in the expression of surface Ig. Thy-1.2, Thy-1.2, and Lyt-2.2, as studied by cytofluorograph analysis. We conclude that the T-thyd-bearing cells in the thymus represent a subpopulation that may be a precursor for Tindd- and Tsud-bearing cells. However, Tthyd-bearing cells are more mature than the Thy-1.2 common T cell precursor, pre-T.
3 Antigen-specific T cell clones restricted to unique F1 major histocompatibility complex determinants. Inhibition of proliferation with monoclonal anti-Ia antibody. The existence of T cells specific for soluble antigens in association with unique F(1) or recombinant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products was first postulated from studies on the proliferative response of whole T cell populations to the antigen poly(Glu(55)Lys(36)Phe(9))(n) (GLphi). In this paper we use the newly developed technology of T lymphocyte cloning to establish unequivocally the existence of such cells specific for GLphi and to generalize their existence by showing that F(1)- specific cells can be isolated from T cell populations primed to poly(Glu(60)Ala(30)Tyr(10))(n) (GAT) where such clones represent only a minor subpopulation of cells. Gl.4b-primed B10.A(5R) and GAT-primed (B10.A x B10)F(1) lymph node T cells were cloned in soft agar, and the colonies that developed were picked and expanded in liquid culture. The GLphi-specific T cells were then recloned under conditions of high-plating efficiency to ensure that the final colonies originated from single cells. T cells from such rigorously cloned populations responded to stimulation with GILphi but only in the presence of nonimmune, irradiated spleen cells bearing (B10.A x B10)F(1) or the syngeneic B 10.A(5R) recombinant MHC haplotype. Spleen cells from either the B10 or B 10.A parental strains failed to support a proliferative response, even when added together. (B10 x B10.D2)F(1) and (B10 x B10.RIII)F(1) spleen cells also supported a proliferative response but (B10 x B10.Q)F(1) and (B10 X B10.S)F(1) spleen cells did not. These results suggested that the T cell clones were specific for GL[phi} in association with the beta(AE)(b)-alpha(E) (k,d,r,) Ia molecule and that recognition required both gene products to be expressed in the same antigen-presenting cells. Support for this interpretation was obtained from inhibition experiments using the monoclonal antibody Y-17 specific for a determinant on the beta(AE)(b)-alphaE Ia molecule. Y-17 completely inhibited the proliferative response of a GLphi-specific clone but had no effect on the response of either a PPD-specific or GAT-specific clone, both of which required the beta(A)-alpha(A) Ia molecule as their restriction element. No evidence could be found for the involvement of suppressor T cells in this inhibition. We therefore conclude that the phenomenon of F(1)-restricted recognition by proliferating T cells results from the presence of antigen- specific clones that must recognize unique F(1) or recombinant Ia molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells in addition to antigen in order to be stimulated.
0 Transduction of bacteriocin determinants in group A streptococci. Determinants of streptococcin A-FF22 (SA) production and host cell immunity have been transduced to three serologically distinct Group A streptococci. Streptomycin resistance markers were not cotransducible with bacteriocin determinants. SA+ transductants of strains unrelated to the parent SA+ strain were unstable but SA+ transductants of a spontaneous SA- derivative of the parent appeared to be stable.
3 Differentiation stages of human natural killer cells in lymphoid tissues from fetal to adult life. Virtually all human granular lymphocytes expressed the HNK-1 differentiation antigen when examined in lymphoid compartments from adults, neonates, and fetuses. The HNK-1+ cells were distinguishable into three subsets having distinct antigenic phenotypes: HNK+T3-M1-, HNK+T3+M1-, and HNK+T3-M1+. Thus, greater than 70% of the HNK-1+ cells from 13-17 wk fetuses (less than 0.2% of nucleated cells) lacked T cell antigens (e.g., T3, T8, T4, and T6) and the M1 myeloid antigen. Morphologically, the HNK+T3-M1- cells consisted of three different types: small granular lymphocytes (less than 10% of HNK-1+ cells), agranular small lymphocytes with a narrow rim of cytoplasm (70-80%), and agranular giant cells (greater than 15 micrometers) with considerable neutrophilic cytoplasm (15%). The purified fetal HNK-1+ cells exhibited a low level of cytotoxicity against K562 target cells. On the other hand, almost all of HNK-1+ cells in neonatal tissues as well as adult bone marrow, lymph node, and thymus, exhibited the HNK+T3+M1- phenotype, contained sparse cytoplasmic granules, and had an intermediate level of NK functional activity. Only adult blood and spleen contained a majority of mature HNK-1+ cells. These cells had an HNK+T3-M1- phenotype, abundant cytoplasmic granules, and maximum NK function. We propose that human NK cells may generate from a separate cell lineage and that they alter their phenotype, morphology, and functional capability during differentiation.
2 Graft-versus-host disease in cyclosporin A-treated rats after syngeneic and autologous bone marrow reconstitution. Lethally irradiated rats treated with cyclosporin A (CsA) for 20-40 d develop classic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) when reconstituted with syngeneic or autologous bone marrow, upon discontinuation of CsA, whereas normal rats do not. Syngeneic GVHD may be transferred to irradiated but not normal syngeneic recipients. Normal spleen cells fail to prevent the development or adoptive transfer of syngeneic GVHD.
3 Surface markers of cloned human T cells with various cytolytic activities. Human T cells stimulated in secondary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) were cloned under limiting conditions in microculture systems using T cell growth factor and irradiated allogeneic cells. Clones with lytic activity against either phytohemagglutinin-induced blast cells bearing the stimulating alloantigen(s) (cytotoxic T lymphocyte [CTL] activity), L1210 mouse lymphoma cells coated with rabbit antibody (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [ADCC]), or K562 human target cells were selected, expanded, and then analyzed for different surface markers, including rosette formation with sheep erythrocytes (E rosettes), receptors for the fc portion of IgG or IgM (Fc gamma R and Fc mu R), and a group of antigens recognized by monoclonal antibodies including Ia, 4F2, OKT8,a nd OKT4. All the cytotoxic cells were E rosette+, Ia+ and 4f2+. Expression of Fc gamma R was restricted to the clones active in ADCC. CTL clones were either OKT8+ or OKT8-. Furthermore, three of the OKT8- CTL clones were OKT4+. In addition, some cytolytic clones devoid of specific CTL activity were OKT8+. It thus appears that the claim that human CTL are OKT8+, OKT4-, and Ia- is not supported by the analysis of their phenotype at the clonal level.
1 Trichomonas vaginalis phenotypic variation occurs only among trichomonads infected with the double-stranded RNA virus. Trichomonas vaginalis isolates were examined for the presence of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the property of phenotypic variation. Only the heterogeneous isolates composed of mAb-reactive and -nonreactive organisms, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytofluorometry, and capable of phenotypic variation possessed the dsRNA. Both the positive and negative phenotype subpopulations separated from the heterogeneous parent contained equal amounts of the dsRNA. Loss of the dsRNA upon prolonged in vitro cultivation always correlated with the lack of expression of the major immunogen. The data indicate a relationship between the presence of the dsRNA and the ability of the pathogenic human trichomonads to express immunogens on their surfaces and to undergo phenotypic variation.
2 Phenotype, specificity, and function of T cell subsets and T cell interactions involved in skin allograft rejection. In the present study we used an adoptive transfer model with athymic nude mice to characterize the T cells involved in initiating and mediating skin allograft rejection. It was found that skin allograft rejection in nude mice required the transfer of immunocompetent T cells and that such reconstitution did not itself stimulate the appearance of T cells derived from the nude host. Reconstitution with isolated populations of Lyt-2+/L3T4- T cells resulted in the rapid rejection of MHC class I-disparate skin allografts, whereas reconstitution with isolated populations of L3T4+/Lyt-2- T cells resulted in the rapid rejection of MHC class II-disparate and minor H-disparate skin allografts. By correlating these rejection responses with the functional capabilities of antigen-specific T cells contained within the reconstituting Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ T cell populations, it was noted that skin allografts were only rejected by mice that, as shown by in vitro assessment, contained both lymphokine-secreting Th cells and lymphokine-responsive Tk cells specific for the alloantigens of the graft. The ability of two such functionally distinct T cell subsets to interact in vivo to reject skin allografts was directly demonstrated in H-Y-specific rejection responses by taking advantage of the fact that H-Y-specific Th cells are L3T4+ while H-Y specific Tk cells are Lyt-2+. Finally, the importance of in vivo interactions between functionally distinct Th/T-inducer cells and T killer (Tk)/T-effector cells in skin allograft rejection was demonstrated by the observation that normal B6 mice retain Qala and Kbm6 skin allografts because of a selective deficiency in antigen-specific Th cells, even though they contain T-effector cells that, when activated, are able to reject such allografts. Thus, the ability to reject skin allografts is neither unique to a specialized subset of T cells with a given Lyt phenotype, nor unique to a specialized subset of helper-independent effector T cells with so-called dual function capability. Rather, skin allograft rejection can be mediated by in vivo collaborations between T-inducer cells and T-effector cells, and the two interacting T cell subsets can express different Lyt phenotypes as well as different antigen specificities.
3 Inhibition of T cell activation in vivo with mixtures of monoclonal antibodies specific for I-A and I-A/E molecules. (CBA x B6)F1 (Iak x Iab) T cells were activated to sheep erythrocytes in irradiated F1 mice in the presence of various monoclonal anti-Ia reagents and then tested for their capacity to collaborate with B cells from B10.BR (I-Ak, I-Ek) (kk), B10.A(4R) (kb), and B10 (bb) mice. Anti-I-Ak antibodies blocked the generation of help for B10.A(4R) B cells, but not B10.BR or B10 B cells. An anti-I-Ab antibody blocked help for B10 B cells, but not for B10.BR or B10.A(4R) B cells. An antibody (Y-17) specific for I-Ak/Ek and I-Ab/Ek molecules, but not for I-Ak or I-Ab molecules, failed to impair the generation of help for B10.BR, B10.A (4R), or B10 B cells. In marked contrast to injecting each antibody separately, a mixture of anti-I-Ak and anti-I-Ak,b/Ek (Y-17) antibodies virtually abolished the generation of help for B10.BR B cells. A mixture of anti-I-Ak and anti-I-Ab antibodies effectively blocked help for (4R x B10)F1 B cells, i.e., cells expressing hybrid I-A molecules. These two antibodies only marginally impaired help for (CBA x B6)F1 B cells. To block help for (CBA x B6)F1 B cells required selection in the presence of a cocktail of anti-I-Ak, anti-I-Ab, and anti-I-Ak,b/Ek antibodies. The implications of these findings are discussed.
3 Inhibition of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) release from the P3HR-1 Burkitt's lymphoma cell line by a monoclonal antibody against a 200,000 dalton EBV membrane antigen. In raising murine hybridoma antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced membrane antigens (MA), we found one antibody that blocked the release of infectious EBV from cultured P3HR-1 cells. This monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognized a 200 kD, phosphonoacetic acid-sensitive (late) MA, and did not directly neutralize virus without complement. When this mAb was added to 33 degrees C-cultured, spontaneously EBV-producing P3HR-1 cells, the intracellular expression of viral capsid antigen and infectious virus was not inhibited, but the appearance of infectious virus in the culture medium was significantly reduced. The duration of this suppression was dependent upon the concentration of the mAb, an effect being observed to a 1:4 X 10(5) titer of the ascites mAb preparation. A more acute effect of suppression of EBV release was observed in a second model of 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate and n-butyrate induction of EBV in 37 degrees C-cultured P3HR-1 cells. Again, intracellular infectious virus production was not inhibited, but the level of infectious virus in the culture medium was significantly reduced as early as 1 and 2 d of culture with antibody. This effect was reversed within 31 h after replacement of mAb-containing medium with fresh medium. This description of antibody-mediated inhibition of EBV release might lead to the characterization of another form of immune defense for the control of EBV infections.
3 Fibronectin enhances the opsonic and protective activity of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody against group B streptococci. We have investigated the opsonic and protective effects of fibronectin (FN) against type III group B streptococci. When used by itself, the FN failed to promote actual internalization of group B organisms. The addition of FN to group B streptococci that had been preopsonized in an immunoglobulin preparation modified for intravenous use ( IgIV ) or a type-specific, murine monoclonal antibody of IgG isotype markedly enhanced interaction with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). A similar enhanced effect was observed when the FN was combined with type-specific monoclonal antibody preparations of IgM and, surprisingly, IgA isotype. Preincubation experiments indicated that the major effect was upon the PMN rather than directly on the bacteria, but we could not demonstrate an effect of FN on cell surface receptors for the Fc fragment of Ig or C3b using rosetting techniques. In addition to enhancing the in vitro opsonic activity of Ig, the FN significantly increased the protective effect of the polyclonal and monoclonal Ig preparations in an animal model of neonatal group B streptococcal disease. Thus, FN appears to have a critical role in the host defense mechanisms against group B streptococci.
3 Novel structural determinants of the human neutrophil chemotactic activity of leukotriene B. A specific 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-eicosa-6,8,10(trans/trans/cis), 14(cis)-tetraenoic acid, designated leukotriene B, is generated by the lipoxygenation and subsequent enzymatic hydration of arachidonic acid in a variety of leukocytes. Leukotriene B elicits a maximal human neutrophil chemotactic response in vitro which is similar in magnitude to those evoked by the chemotactic fragment of the fifth component of complement, C5a, synthetic formyl-methionyl peptides, and 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE). The neutrophil chemotactic potency of purified leukotriene B, assessed by the 50% effective concentration of 6 x 10(-9) M, is equivalent to that of C5a, but is up to 100-fold greater than that of 5-HETE and of other natural di-HETE isomers. 5(S),12(R)-di-hydroxy-eicosa-6,8,10(all-trans),14(cis)-tetraenoic acid, which differs from leukotriene B only in having a trans-double bond in place of a cis-double bond in the triene portion of the molecule, and acetyl-leukotriene B are significantly less potent neutrophil chemotactic factors than leukotriene B, which indicates that both the conjugated double bonds and the free hydroxyl-group(s) are functionally critical determinants. The capacity of acetyl-leukotriene B to inhibit competitively and selectively the human neutrophil chemotactic response to equimolar concentrations of leukotriene B suggests the existence of a specific subset of receptors for this potent lipid mediator.
3 Augmentation of macrophage complement receptor function in vitro. IV. The lymphokine that activates macrophage C3 receptors for phagocytosis binds to a fucose-bearing glycoprotein on the macrophage plasma membrane. Macrophage receptors for the third component of complement (C3) are normally immobilized and unable to diffuse within the cell's plasma membrane and, even though they promote avid particle binding, are unable to promote phagocytosis of C3-coated particles. We have previously identified a lymphokine that activates macrophage C3 receptors for phagocytosis and have found that it acts by freeing the receptors so that they can diffuse within the macrophage plasma membrane. It seemed likely to us that the initial lymphokine-macrophage interaction would occur at the macrophage surface, perhaps via a specific lymphokine receptor. Since the binding of many ligands to cells is mediated by cell surface glycoproteins, we examined the protein and sugar requirements for murine peritoneal macrophages to respond to the lymphokine. Macrophages treated with the neutral protease Dispase lost the ability to respond to the lymphokine, and inclusion of L-fucose in the incubation medium containing lymphokine and macrophages inhibited markedly the macrophages' response to the lymphokine, suggesting that the lymphokine exerts its effects by first binding to fucose residues on a glycoprotein receptor on the macrophage surface. Further evidence for the essential role of macrophage surface fucose was obtained by demonstrating that pretreatment of macrophages with either fucosidase or gorse lectin, a fucose-binding lectin, strikingly disabled the cells from responding to the lymphokine. All treatments that prevented lymphokine activation of macrophage C3 receptors for phagocytosis also prevented lymphokine-induced C3 receptor mobility. These results strongly suggest that the lymphokine binds to a fucose-bearing macrophage surface glycoprotein, perhaps a specific lymphokine receptor. They also strengthen our hypothesis that, for a receptor to be able to promote phagocytosis, it must be able to diffuse within the macrophage plasma membrane.
3 Helper or cytolytic functions can be selectively induced in bifunctional T cell clones. By using bifunctional T cell populations, we have shown in this report that elicitation of helper versus cytolytic function depends on the stimulatory signal at the membrane. Interestingly enough, the transduction of these signals is likely to be achieved via different metabolic pathways. Thus, helper function is associated with intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and PLC activation, while cytolysis can occur even in the absence of detectable levels of these second messengers. These results indicate that selective activation through the same membrane-transducing molecule may orientate T cell function through qualitatively or quantitatively different second messengers. This would be an important part of immune regulation.
3 Expression and characterization of a truncated murine Fc gamma receptor. We have isolated a recombinant secreted Fc gamma R beta molecule by deletion of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains encoding sequence from a Fc gamma R beta 1 cDNA clone, and insertion of the truncated cDNA into a eukaryotic expression vector, pcEXV-3. To express and amplify the production of the truncated Fc gamma R beta molecule, we transfected the truncated cDNA plasmid into a dihydrofolate reductase-minus CHO cell line along with a dhfr minigene, and amplified the gene products with methotrexate. The resulting cell line secretes 2-3 micrograms/ml/24 h of truncated Fc gamma R beta, which can be readily purified by affinity chromatography on IgG-Sepharose. The truncated Fc gamma R beta has a Mr of 31-33,000 on SDS-PAGE and is glycosylated. N-glycosidase F cleavage reduces the Mr to 19,000, consistent with the size of the truncated product, 176 amino acid residues. There are two disulfide bonds in the protein. Binding of immune complexes formed between DNP20BSA and anti-DNP mAbs reveals better binding of IgG1 aggregates than that of IgG2b and IgG2a aggregates. The binding of the immune complexes was somewhat better at more acidic pH, in contrast to previous experiments with binding of purified Fc gamma R to immune complex-coated beads. We were surprised to observe that the truncated Fc gamma R beta did not react with the anti-Fc gamma R mAb 6B7C. Previous work had shown that 6B7C reacts with Fc gamma R on immunoblots, fails to bind to the surface of resting B cells and peritoneal macrophages, but does bind to macrophage cell lines and LPS-stimulated B cells. We show, by binding of mAb 6B7C to a peptide conjugate, that the 6B7C epitope lies within residues 169-183 of the intact Fc gamma R beta, which is just outside the plasma membrane. The availability of the truncated Fc gamma R beta in microgram quantities should facilitate further analysis of structure and function of these receptors.
3 Engagement of CD4 and CD8 expressed on immature thymocytes induces activation of intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation pathways. Accumulating data suggest that the target cells for selection events leading to establishment of the mature T cell repertoire are the functionally immature double-positive (CD4+/CD8+) thymocytes, and that the CD4 and CD8 antigens expressed on these cells play important roles in these processes. In an attempt to define the biochemical pathways implicated in these events, we have studied the effects of engagement of accessory molecules on tyrosine protein phosphorylation. The results of our experiments demonstrate that engagement of CD4 and CD8 expressed on double-positive thymocytes is coupled with a rapid tyrosine protein phosphorylation signal. Further analyses have revealed that these two surface molecules are physically associated with the internal membrane tyrosine protein kinase p56lck in immature thymocytes, and that the catalytic function of lck expressed in double-positive thymocytes is significantly enhanced upon engagement of CD4. These data provide evidence that tyrosine-specific protein phosphorylation pathways coupled to the CD4 and CD8 T cell surface antigens are functional in immature thymocytes, and therefore, formally prove that signaling functions of CD4 and CD8 molecules are operative in immature thymocytes.
3 Structural characterization of antiidiotypic antibodies. Evidence that Ab2s are derived from the germline differently than Ab1s. We have found that syngeneic Ab2s in the antiarsonate system are serologically and structurally similar to one another. In contrast, the allogeneic Ab2 response is heterogeneous and derives from a large number of unrelated germline gene segments. The Ab2 response of the BALB/c strain to polyclonal A/J Ars A molecules can probably best be compared with a response to a foreign protein and might have been predicted in a strain that completely lacks the H chain V region gene from which the Ab1 derives. Partial variable region sequences of Ab2s from three other systems in addition to previously reported Ab2 structures indicates that this difference in allogeneic vs. syngeneic Ab2s may be a general phenomena. These data support Jerne's hypothesis of complementary V region genes existing in the germline. However, there is good evidence that these antiidiotypic antibodies are not derived directly from the germline, as somatic processes most likely play an important role in their generation. The D segments of Ab2s in the arsonate system as well as in other systems, are novel in structure and cannot easily be explained by previously described germline D segments. D-D fusion may play a role in the generation of the third hypervariable region in these antibodies.
1 Antigen-specific suppression of human antibody responses by allogeneic T cells. I. Frequency and antigen specificity of allogeneic suppressor T cells and their role in major histocompatibility complex-controlled genetic restriction. Specific antibody responses to influenza virus were obtained in vitro from human blood mononuclear cells (PBM). The addition of allogeneic T cells to responding PBM profoundly suppressed antigen-induced antibody responses, but had no effect on pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced polyclonal Ig formation. This raised the possibility that suppression by allogeneic T cells may result from the activation of antigen-specific T suppressor (Ts) cells rather than nonspecific allogeneic effects. The frequency of allogeneic Ts in PBM from a number of different donors, estimated in a series of limiting dilution analyses, was found to range from 0.8 X 10(-5) to 4.5 X 10(-5), which is more typical of antigen-specific than alloreactive T cells. By adding limiting numbers of allogeneic T cells to antibody-forming cultures stimulated simultaneously with two non-cross-reacting antigens (influenza A and B strain viruses A/X31 and B/HK), it was possible to demonstrate suppression of the response to one antigen, but not the other, in the same culture well. Moreover, the frequency of wells in which the response to both antigens was suppressed was not significantly different from that predicted from the calculated frequency of specific allogeneic Ts. These results show that allogeneic suppression was antigen specific, and was not due to non-specific allogeneic effects. By separating T cell preparations into Leu-3a+ (helper) and Leu-2a+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) T cell subsets, suppression was shown to be mediated by a radiosensitive Leu-2a+ T cell. The removal of Leu-2a+ cells from T cell preparations abrogated the suppressor effect and permitted T cell collaboration with B cells, across an HLA-A, -B, and -DR barrier. This result shows that in at least some combinations, suppression rather than major histocompatibility complex restriction is the reason for the failure of allogeneic T and B cells to collaborate in T cell-dependent antibody responses.
3 Generation of idiotype-specific T cell help through network perturbation. Different manipulations of BALB/c mice were used to generate idiotype-specific help: neonatally induced suppression of the T 15 idiotype and low-dose priming with anti-T15 antibody. The splenic foci culture system was used to study T15-idiotype-recognizing helper T cells under limiting-cell-dose conditions. These treatments induced T15 idiotype-specific help for B cells responding to TNP-T15. Normal or hemocyanin-primed BALB/c mice did not supply T15 idiotype-specific help. The helper cells were sensitive to anti-Thy-1.2 and complement treatment and can distinguish T15 from an idiotype-different, PC-binding myeloma protein, M167, and the TNP binding myeloma protein, M460. These data show that idiotype-specific T helper cells can be induced by at least two different manipulations of the idiotype network. These manipulations presumably do not act directly on the T15-recognizing T cells, but must involve complementary idiotypic circuits that stimulate anti-T15 specific T cells. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the splenic-fragment culture technique provides a general method to investigate, at the single cell level, idiotypic T-B cell interactions induced by perturbations of the immune network.
3 B cell stimulatory factor 1 (interleukin 4) is sufficient for the proliferation and differentiation of lectin-stimulated cytolytic T lymphocyte precursors. In this report, we demonstrate that IL-4 is sufficient to stimulate both the proliferation and differentiation of Lyt-2+, Ia- splenic CTL precursors stimulated with the mitogenic lectin Con A. The response to IL-4 and Con A was not dependent on a putative endogenous production of IL-2 within the cultures, as demonstrated by an absence of an inhibitory effect by an anti-IL-2-R blocking mAb. Our results indicate that IL-2 and IL-4 can support an equivalent proliferative response by lectin-stimulated Lyt-2+ T lymphocytes, while IL-4 is more efficacious in stimulating their differentiation into mature cytolytically active cells.
3 Both a monoclonal antibody and antisera specific for determinants unique to individual cloned helper T cell lines can substitute for antigen and antigen-presenting cells in the activation of T cells. Two antisera and a monoclonal antibody raised in BALB.K mice against cloned, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted, antigen-specific helper T cell lines are described. These antibodies are specific for individual cloned T cell lines and are potent inducers of T cell proliferation. The induction of T cell proliferation by these antibodies requires the presence of an adherent accessory cell. There is no H-2 restriction between this accessory cell and the cloned T cell, nor is this antibody-induced proliferation blocked by a monoclonal anti-Fc receptor antibody. The requirement for an accessory cell, however, is eliminated in the presence of an IL-1- or IL-2-rich supernatant. Thus this system allows the analysis of helper T cell activation with only a single cell type present. Anti-T cell sera also induce T cell-dependent B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion. The induction of T cell-dependent B cell activation by these sera does not require H-2-matched T cells and B cells. The specificity of these antibodies and their ability to stimulate cloned helper T cells in the absence of antigen and antigen-presenting cells strongly suggest that these antibodies are directed against antigen and/or Ia recognition sites on the T cell.
3 The B cell repertoire revealed by major histocompatibility complex-specific helper T cells. I. Frequencies of a genetically defined V region marker among mitogen- and T helper cell-reactive B lymphocytes in normal and immunized mice. The aim of the present work was to analyze the frequencies of a genetically defined variable (V) region marker in the B cell subset sensitive to T cell help. To this end we used an alloreactive T cell line that has the property of inducing B cells of the appropriate haplotype to exponential growth and polyclonal antibody synthesis. The frequency obtained with this helper line was also directly compared to that obtained with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that in normal BALB/c mice the frequency of M460-positive clonotypes was respectively, 1/100 and 1/1,000 among the T helper- and LPS-sensitive B cell subsets. In mice immunized with antiidiotype coupled to a thymus-dependent antigen, the differences in the numbers of idiotype-positive precursors were even more accentuated, i.e. 1/20 in the B cell subset triggered by T helper cells and 1/800 in those cells responsive to LPS. The frequencies of the M460 determinant in mice immunized with anti-idiotypes coupled to thymus-independent antigens were not significantly different, in either B cell subset, from those obtained with spleen cells of normal nonimmunized animals. Taken as a whole, our results imply that the V gene repertoire revealed by LPS includes precursor distribution, as this distribution occurs during the early stage of B cell development (potential repertoire), while the repertoire revealed by T helper cells includes the V region distribution of those clones that are selected in the periphery of the functional immune system.
3 Cell interactions between histoincompatible T and B lymphocytes. VII. Cooperative responses between lymphocytes are controlled by genes in the I region of the H-2 complex. The results of this study provide compelling evidence for the existence of the gene or genes controlling optimal T-B-cell cooperative interactions in the designated I region of the H-2 gene complex. Previously, we have speculated that the relevant gene(s) involved may well be located in this region based on several observations from our earlier work in this area (3, 5, 6). Thus, in the preceding paper, we showed that T and B cells from B10.BR and A strain mice developed effective cooperative interactions in vitro to DNP-KLH in a system identical to the one reported herein. Since these mice differ for genes in the S and D regions of H-2 but are identical for K and I region genes, we were able to localize the critical genes to the K-end of H-2.
3 Prevention of type II collagen-induced arthritis by in vivo treatment with anti-L3T4. The effect of in vivo administration of monoclonal anti-L3T4 antibody on the development of murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was assessed. Treatment with anti-L3T4 resulted in a greater than 90% depletion of L3T4+ T cells in lymph nodes and spleen, an effect that appears entirely reversed 30 d after treatment. Administration of anti-L3T4 before immunization with type II collagen resulted in a significant decrease in arthritis incidence and delayed onset of the disease while treatment begun after a strong anticollagen IgG humoral response was underway was not effective in altering disease expression. These results suggest a prominent role for L3T4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of CIA.
3 Nucleic acid and protein sequences of phosphocholine-binding light chains. An 18-kilobase DNA fragment containing the sequence coding for both the variable and constant regions of the S107 mouse immunoglobulin light chain was cloned from total cellular DNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of the kappa-chain variable-region gene is reported. Determination of the amino acid sequence encoded by the DNA is found to be identical to the protein sequence of the T15 light chain through residue 88. Direct sequence analysis confirmed that the J1 joining segment is used in the recombination event producing the active kappa light chain gene.
1 Activated human lymphocytes and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas express a homologue of the rat metastasis-associated variant of CD44. A recently described splice variant of CD44 expressed in metastasizing cell lines of rat tumors, has been shown to confer metastatic potential to nonmetastasizing rat pancreatic carcinoma and sarcoma cell lines. Using antibodies raised against a bacterial fusion protein encoded by variant CD44 sequences, we have explored the expression of variant CD44 glycoproteins on human lymphoid cells and tissues and on non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Normal lymphohematopoietic cells express barely detectable low levels of variant CD44 glycoproteins, whereas T lymphocytes, upon activation by mitogen or antigen, transiently upregulate expression of specific CD44 variant glycoproteins. The reaction pattern of various antibodies indicates that these CD44 variants contain the domain encoded by exon v6, which is part of the variant that in the rat confers metastatic capability. It is interesting that overexpression of v6 was also found in several aggressive, but not low-grade, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
3 Receptor analogs and monoclonal antibodies that inhibit adherence of Bordetella pertussis to human ciliated respiratory epithelial cells. The adherence of Bordetella pertussis to human respiratory cilia is critical to the pathogenesis of whooping cough. To explore the development of agents that could interrupt adherence, the structure of the receptor on the ciliary surface was investigated. Using an in vitro adherence assay to human ciliated epithelial cells, galactose, lactose, and complex carbohydrates containing lactose eliminated adherence when preincubated with the bacteria. 10(-2) M galactose eluted adherent bacteria from cilia. B. pertussis and its two purified adhesins bound specifically to natural lactose-containing glycolipids in a TLC assay. mAbs to eukaryotic glycoconjugates with specificity for substituted galactose-glucose moieties blocked adherence when preincubated with ciliated cells. The carbohydrates that serve as receptors for B. pertussis on human cilia are galactose-glucose-containing glycolipids. Receptor analogs and anti-receptor antibodies effectively block adherence of B. pertussis to cilia and thus should be considered candidates for therapeutic intervention against disease.
3 Identification of a subpopulation of lymphocytes in human peripheral blood cytotoxic to autologous fibroblasts. A naturally occurring subpopulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes is cytotoxic to autologous and/or allogeneic fibroblasts. The autocytotoxic lymphocytes have a receptor for the third component of complement and for aggregated gamma globulin, do not form rosettes with sheep red blood cells, and are not removed by passage through nylon. The autocytotoxic subpopulation is not present in the thymus and tonsils of normal children or in the peripheral blood of individuals with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Fibroblast absorption experiments demonstrate that the autocytotoxic cells are "sensitized" to antigens expressed on allogeneic fibroblasts in addition to the antigens expressed on autologous cells. Some normal individuals have a second subpopulation of lymphocytes that may "regulate" the autocytotoxic cells. The relevance of these observations to the murine autocytotoxic cells is discussed.
3 Real time fluorescence imaging of PLC gamma translocation and its interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor. The translocation of fluorescently tagged PLC gamma and requirements for this process in cells stimulated with EGF were analyzed using real time fluorescence microscopy applied for the first time to monitor growth factor receptor--effector interactions. The translocation of PLC gamma to the plasma membrane required the functional Src homology 2 domains and was not affected by mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain or inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. An array of domains specific for PLC gamma isoforms was sufficient for this translocation. The dynamics of translocation to the plasma membrane and redistribution of PLC gamma, relative to localization of the EGF receptor and PI 4,5-biphosphate (PI 4,5-P(2)), were shown. Colocalization with the receptor was observed in the plasma membrane and in membrane ruffles where PI 4,5-P(2) substrate could also be visualized. At later times, internalization of PLC gamma, which could lead to separation from the substrate, was observed. The data support a direct binding of PLC gamma to the receptor as the main site of the plasma membrane recruitment. The presence of PLC gamma in membrane structures and its access to the substrate appear to be transient and are followed by a rapid incorporation into intracellular vesicles, leading to downregulation of the PLC activity.
3 Role of accessory cells in B cell activation. III. Cellular analysis of primary immune response deficits in CBA/N mice: presence of an accessory cell-B cell interaction defect. The effect of the X-linked CBA/N genetic defect on the ability of mice to generate primary responses to thymic-dependent and thymic-independent antigens was assessed by comparing the ability of abnormal (CBA/N x DBA/2)F1 male mice and normal (DBA/2 x CBA/N)F1 male mice to generate 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl (TNP)-specific plaque-forming cell responses to TNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), TNP-conjugated Ficoll (TNP-Ficoll), TNP-Brucella abortus (BA), and TNP-lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The reciprocal F1 combinations used in this study differ genetically only in the origin of their X chromosome, but differ immunologically in that (CBA/N x DBA/2)F1 male mice express all the CBA/N immune abnormalities, whereas (DBA/2 x CBA/N)F1 male mice are immunologically normal. Analysis of thymic-dependent responses to TNP-KLH revealed that abnormal F1 mice were capable of generating primary responses in vivo to high doses of TNP-KLH, but failed to generate responses to suboptimal doses of TNP-KLH that were still immunogenic for normal F1 mice. Furthermore, under limiting in vitro micro-culture conditions, the abnormal F1 mice failed to generate primary thymic-dependent responses to any dose of TNP-KLH, even though under the identical conditions normal F1 mice consistently responded to a wide antigen dose range. The cellular basis of the failure of abnormal F1 mice to respond in vitro to TNP-KLH was investigated by assaying the ability of purified populations of accessory cells, T cells, and B cells from these mice to function in responses to TNP-KLH. The results of these experiments demonstrated that helper T cells and antigen-presenting accessory cells from abnormal F1 mice were competent and functioned as well as the equivalent cell populations from normal F1 mice. Instead, the failure of CBA/N mice to generate primary in vitro responses to TNP-KLH was solely the result of a defect in their B cell population such that B cells from these mice failed to be triggered by competent helper T cells and/or competent accessory cells. Similarly, the failure of abnormal F1 mice to respond either in vivo or in vitro to TNP-Ficoll was not the result of defective accessory cell presentation of TNP-Ficoll, but was the result of the failure of B cells from these mice to be activated by competent TNP-Ficoll-presenting accessory cells. In contrast to the failure of B cells from abnormal F1 mice to be activated in vitro in response to either TNP-KLH or TNP-Ficoll, B cells from abnormal F1 mice were triggered to respond to TNP-BA and TNP-LPS, antigens that did not require accessory cell presentation. The specific failure of B cells fron abnormal F1 mice to be activated in responses that required antigen-presentation by accessory cells suggested the possibility that the X-linked CBA/N genetic defect resulted in B cell populations that might be deficient in their ability to interact with antigen-presenting accessory cells...
2 Requirement for vasoactive amines for production of delayed-type hypersensitvity skin reactions. The skin sites of the mouse where delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions are most easily elicited (foot pads and ears) are particularly rich in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-containing mast cells. Since mice are deficient in circulating basophils, which play a role in at least some DTH reactions, we investigated the possibility that the mast cells were playing an important role in the evolution of the skin reactions of DTH in mice. We found that reserpine, a drug which depletes mast cells of 5-HT, abolished the ability of the mouse to make DTH reactions in the skin. The suppressive effect of reserpine could be partially blocked by monoamine oxidase inhibitors which prevent the degradation of 5-HT in the cytosol of the mast cell. Spleen cells of immune, reserpine-treated mice transferred DTH reactions to nonimmune mice normally, indicating that the reserpine treatment did not affect immune T cells. DTH reactions could not be transferred into reserpine-treated mice. We suggest that T cells are continually emigrating from the blood, through postcapillary venule endothelium, by a mechanism which does not depend on vasoactive amines. If they are appropriately immune and meet the homologous antigen in the tissue, they induce mast cells to release vasoactive amines which cause postcapillary venule endothelial cells to separate, allowing the egress from the blood of cells which ordinarily do not recirculate. The secondarily arriving vasoactive amine-dependent cells are responsible for the micro- and macroscopic lesions of DTH reactions. Chemotactic factors may also be involved in bringing cells to the DTH reaction sites but we propose that T-cell regulation of vasoactive amine-containing cells allows the effector cells to pass through the endothelial gates after they are called.
0 Human leukocyte antigen F (HLA-F). An expressed HLA gene composed of a class I coding sequence linked to a novel transcribed repetitive element. We describe here the isolation and sequencing of a previously uncharacterized HLA class I gene. This gene, HLA-5.4, is the third non-HLA-A,B,C gene characterized whose sequence shows it encodes an intact class I protein. RNase protection assays with a probe specific for this gene demonstrated its expression in B lymphoblastoid cell lines, in resting T cells, and skin cells, while no mRNA could be detected in the T cell line Molt 4. Consistent with a pattern of expression different from that of other class I genes, DNA sequence comparisons identified potential regulator motifs unique to HLA-5.4 and possibly essential for tissue-specific expression. Protein sequence analysis of human and murine class I antigens has identified 10 highly conserved residues believed to be involved in antigen binding. Five of these are altered in HLA-5.4, and of these, three are nonconservative. In addition, examination of the HLA-5.4 DNA sequence predicts that the cytoplasmic segment of this protein is shorter than that of the classical transplantation antigens. The 3' untranslated region of the HLA-5.4 gene contains one member of a previously undescribed multigene family consisting of at least 30 members. Northern analysis showed that several of these sequences were transcribed, and the most ubiquitous transcript, a 600-nucleotide polyadenylated mRNA, was found in all tissues and cells examined. This sequence is conserved in the mouse genome, where a similar number of copies were found, and one of these sequences was also transcribed, yielding a 600-nucleotide mRNA. The characterization of this unique HLA class I gene and the demonstration of its tissue-specific expression have prompted us to propose that HLA-5.4 be designated HLA-F.
0 New cell surface gp70 related to Friend mink cell focus-inducing virus is expressed on Friend virus-induced erythroleukemic spleen cells after elimination of ecotropic Friend virus gp70 in Rfv-3r/s mice. Spleen cells from Rfv-3r/s mice with Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia were analyzed for expression of virus-induced proteins with monoclonal antiviral antibodies and conventional antisera. Leukemic spleen cells, 30-60 d after virus inoculation, expressed decreased amounts of ecotropic Friend murine leukemia helper virus gag- and env-encoded cell surface and intracellular proteins compared with leukemic cells tested 8-10 d after virus inoculation. In contrast, the spleen focus-forming virus-induced protein, gp55, was present on both leukemia cell populations. This difference appeared to be mediated by the humoral antibody response in Rfv-3r/s mice, which could recognize only ecotropic gag and env proteins, and not gp55. A new gp70 molecule cross-reactive with a recombinant Friend mink cell focus-inducing virus was found in large quantities on late leukemic cells. This protein appeared to be derived from a recombinant virus produced during the course of Friend virus infection. The appearance of this new gp70 suggests that recombinant viruses other than spleen focus-forming virus may play a role in Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia.
2 Amelioration of B16F10 melanoma lung metastasis in mice by a combination therapy with indomethacin and interleukin 2. Our earlier work revealed that PGE-mediated inactivation of NK cells in tumor-bearing mice by host macrophages promoted spontaneous lung metastasis that could be prevented or ameliorated by chronic indomethacin therapy. Since PGE was found to suppress the in vitro development and/or activation of a family of tumoricidal lymphocytes such as CTL, NK, and LAK cells by one or both of two mechanisms, that is to say, a down regulation of IL-2-R and an inhibition of IL-2 production, the present study tested whether a combined therapy with indomethacin and IL-2 was more effective than one with indomethacin or IL-2 alone in ameliorating established experimental lung metastasis. B6 mice injected intravenously with 10(6) highly metastatic B16F10 melanoma cells showed profuse micrometastases in the lungs by day 5, and macrometastases by day 10 which were confluent on day 21. Chronic indomethacin therapy by the oral route (14 micrograms/ml in drinking water) starting on day 0 or day 5, or a single round of IL-2 therapy (25,000 U rIL-2, every 8 h for 5 d on days 10-14) reduced the number of metastatic nodules by two-thirds (from a median of 473 in control mice receiving vehicles alone) by day 21. A single round of IL-2 as above, combined with either protocol of indomethacin therapy, completely or nearly completely irradicated the lung metastases, corroborated by a histological examination. An evaluation of splenic killer cell activity measured with a 4-h 51Cr-release assay against NK-sensitive YAC-1 lymphoma and B16F10 melanoma or NK-resistant thymic lymphoma 9705 targets revealed negligible activity in control tumor-bearing mice, and a good restoration of activity against NK-sensitive targets with either protocols of indomethacin therapy. IL-2 alone or a combination of IL-2 and indomethacin given by either protocol generated strong killer activity against all these targets, most marked with the combination therapy. Splenic killer cell phenotype in normal as well as all treated animals was ASGM1+, Thy-1-, and Lyt-2-. The combination therapy resulted in the strongest mononuclear cell infiltration in the lungs, with areas of young granulation tissue suggestive of repair sites of original metastases.
3 Lymphokine and nonlymphokine mRNA levels in stimulated human T cells. Kinetics, mitogen requirements, and effects of cyclosporin A. Northern and dot blotting with a panel of DNA probes were used to monitor the levels of specific mRNAs in mitogen-stimulated human T cells. The induction of IL-2 and IFN mRNAs required the synergistic action of PMA and either PHA or OKT3 mAb. In contrast, several nonlymphokine genes, the protooncogenes c-fos and c-myc, and the IL-2-R gene, were induced by either PHA or PMA alone. PHA increased the background levels of a 70 kD heat shock protein mRNA, but did not affect the observed background of c-myb mRNA. For all mRNAs that were induced, isolated CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets behaved similarly. Exogenous IL-2 had little (IFN) or no (IL-2) effect on lymphokine mRNAs, but significantly increased c-myc, IL-2-R and heat shock protein mRNAs. Therefore, the stimuli for lymphokine mRNAs differed from those required for several inducible nonlymphokine genes. IL-2 and IFN mRNAs exhibited some important similarities with c-myc, however. The levels of IL-2, IFN, and c-myc mRNA followed similar kinetics, peaking at 3 h in restimulated blasts and at 12 h in unstimulated T cells. The subsequent downregulation of lymphokine and c-myc mRNAs was retarded by cycloheximide. The induction of IL-2, IFN, and c-myc mRNAs was blocked by the immunosuppressive drug CsA, but not by the inactive analog CsH, and this block occurred at the level of nuclear transcription. Since the exogenous stimuli for lymphokine and c-myc gene expression differ, we suggest that intracellular controls must be shared to account for the similarities in their kinetics of expression and CsA sensitivity.
3 Induction of antiphosphorylcholine antibody formation by anti-idiotypic antibodies. Anti-idiotypic antibodies have been used to mimic antigen in the mouse antiphosphorylcholine response in order to investigate the induction of precursors of antibody-forming cells. We have shown that interaction of anti-idiotype antibody with receptor antibody molecules induces the formation of antibodies that are specific for phosphorylcholine and carry the idiotypic determinants. This induction is dependent on the recognition of carrier determinants on the anti-idiotype antibody by helper T cells. We conclude that receptor antibody molecules on the surface of the precursors of antibody-forming cells deliver the antigenic signal for the induction of these cells.
3 Human immune response to immunization with a structurally defined polypeptide fragment of streptococcal M protein. We tested the ability of pepsin-extracted, highly purified M protein to induce type-specific immunity in experimental animals and humans. M protein was prepared from limited peptic digests of whole group A type 24 streptococci and was purified to chemical homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, quantitative amino acid analysis, and Edman degradation. For vaccination, the lyophilized M24 protein preparation (pep M24) was precipitated in aluminum hydroxide. When injected into laboratory animals, alum-precipitated pep M24 produced type-specific protective antibodies and was free of non-type-specific immunoreactivity. In man, skin tests with 1-microgram doses of pep M24 were negative in all 37 adults tested. 12 adult human volunteers received two-four subcutaneous injections of 100-200 micrograms of alum-precipitated pep M24 at intervals of at least 2 wk. The immune response to pep M24 was measured by a variety of assays designed to detect (a) type-specific humoral antibodies (opsonophagocytic, long chain, and mouse protection tests); (b) total humoral antibodies (complement fixation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay); (c) cellular immunity (skin tests); and (d) heart cross-reactive antibodies (immunofluorescence). Type-specific opsonic antibodies developed in 10 of the 12 vaccinees, and positive delayed-type skin tests developed in 11. Immune sera from two of the vaccinees were effective in mouse-protection tests against challenge with M24 but not M6 streptococci. None of the volunteers developed heart-reactive antibodies or antibodies to non-type-specific M protein antigens. Alum-precipitated pep M24 was well-tolerated in man, and no serious local or systemic reactions were observed. Thus, pep M24 induces type-specific, protective antibodies in doses that are well-tolerated in man.
3 Expression of a monoclonal antibody-defined, B-lineage transformation antigen specifically identifies Abelson-diseased animals. Genetically determined resistance to Abelson murine leukemia virus acts before induction of gp160(6C3). Mice genetically susceptible or genetically resistant to the leukemogenic effects of A-MuLV(Mo) were tested for their expression of the B-lineage neoplastic transformation-associated antigen, 6C3Ag. Genetically resistant inbred strains and recombinant inbred lines developed neither cells expressing high levels of 6C3Ag (6C3Aghi) in their hematolymphoid tissues nor Abelson leukemias. Genetically susceptible inbred strains and recombinant inbred lines developed high percentages of 6C3Aghi hematolymphoid cells concomitant with development of Abelson leukemias and lymphomas. Thus the genetically-determined resistance to A-MuLV(Mo) leukemogenesis appears to act at some step(s) after virus infection but before the stage of malignant progression, which is marked by 6C3Ag expression.
3 Antigen-initiated B-lymphocyte differentiation. VIII. Sedimentation velocity and buoyant density characterization of virgin antibody-forming cell progenitors in the adoptive immune response of unprimed CBA mice to 4-hydroxy-3-iodo-5-nitrophenylacetic acid-polymerized bacterial flagellin antigen. The characteristics of antibody-forming cell (AFC) progenitors lacking previous contact with specific antigen (virgin AFC progenitors) has been studied using sedimentation velocity and buoyant density separation for the investigation of physically distinct B-cell subpopulations. Functional characterization of isolated subsets was made using a quantitative adoptive immune assay for the IgM AFC progenitors responding to the antigen 4-hydroxy-3-iodo-5-nitrophenylacetic acid conjugated polymerized bacterial flagellin. Extensive heterogeneity is present among B lymphocytes, only some subpopulations of which exhibit AFC progenitor function. In the spleen of adult conventional CBA mice, atypically fast sedimenting cells of low buoyant density are active, while typical small B lymphocytes do not appear to be progenitors of IgM AFC. Spleen of adult specific pathogen-free (SPF), germfree, and athymic nude mice give similar results, although a minor population of typical slowly sedimenting dense cells are active in the latter two sources. Adult conventional bone marrow cells are as physically and functionally heterogeneous as splenic B cells, and although a significant proportion of AFC progenitor activity is found among dense, slowly sedimenting cells, most of the activity is among low density, faster sedimenting cells. In contrast to this situation in adult animals, where most of the unprimed AFC progenitors are large, atypical B cells, the spleens of neonatal mice provide a site where virgin AFC progenitors with the physical properties of typical small B lymphocytes are found. While being present in conventional and SPF neonatal spleens, these virgin cells are predominant in 7-day-old germfree mouse spleen. These findings suggest that the newborn virgin B cell is a typical small lymphocyte. However, few cells of this type are found in the adult animal. The unprimed AFC-progenitor population in the adult consists of large, fast sedimenting, low buoyant density, adherent cells, the physical properties of which are characteristic of activated B lymphocytes. It is suggested that these atypical cells are derived from the small newborn virgin B cell by the nonspecific effects of environmental antigenic stimuli.
3 Enhancement of glomerular immune complex deposition by a circulating polycation. It is known that polycations bind to and neutralize glomerular polyanions. Here we examine the effect of the polycation polyethyleneimine (PEI) on glomerular deposition of preformed immune complexes. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)-anti-BSA immune complexes made in 40 times antigen excess were administered following intravenous injection of PEI. Glomerular localization of immune deposits was assessed by quantitative immunofluorescence and electron microscopy and compared to controls receiving diluent without PEI followed by the same dose in immune complexes. In rats receiving PEI, deposits were localized within the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) of all peripheral capillary walls and in the mesangium. In controls, deposits localized exclusively within the mesangium in smaller amounts than after PEI. Thus, neutralization of glomerular polyanion by a circulating polycation enhances the deposition and alters the distribution of immune complexes in glomeruli.
2 Lysis of ovarian cancer cells by human lymphocytes redirected with a chimeric gene composed of an antibody variable region and the Fc receptor gamma chain. To expand the spectrum of recognition of effector lymphocytes and to redirect them towards predefined targets, we have altered the specificity of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) through stable modification with chimeric receptor genes consisting of single-chain antibody variable regions linked to the gamma subunit common to the immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgE Fc receptors. Using either hapten or ovarian carcinoma-specific monoclonal antibodies, we constructed chimeric receptor genes and retrovirally introduced them into CD8+ TIL. Redirected TIL specifically lysed trinitrophenyl-labeled Daudi or a human ovarian carcinoma cell line (IGROV-1), and secreted granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor upon stimulation with the appropriate antigen. This strategy may allow new approaches towards the adoptive immunotherapy of cancer in humans.
3 Independent association of T cell receptor beta and gamma chains with CD3 in the same cell. We have demonstrated that the PEER cell line, which expresses a CD3-associated TCR gamma chain on the cell surface, synthesizes TCR beta chain intracellularly. A percentage of this TCR beta chain associates with the CD3 complex intracellularly. These results indicate that TCR beta and gamma chains can be synthesized by one cell line, and that these chains can independently associate with the CD3 complex. However, the results argue against the formation of TCR beta gamma chain complexes in this cell line.
3 Complement-mediated tumor cell damage induced by antibodies against membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46). We have developed polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against human membrane cofactor protein (MCP) to use as tools to investigate the functions of MCP on intact nucleated cells. Two human T cell lines, CEM and TALL, are CR1- and DAF-. Pretreatment of these cell lines with M177 and polyclonal anti-MCP, which inhibit cofactor activity almost completely, resulted in effective C3 deposition immediately following addition of these cells to Mg2+/EGTA/human sera. The deposited C3 remained expressed partly on the cell surface and most of them were gradually converted to C3bi. Some of the deposited C3 were complexed with membrane proteins, since 140- and 250-kD bands became significantly accumulated on SDS-PAGE by treatment with the antibodies. We next tested whether these C3-coated cells were damaged by complement-mediated cytolysis. p18, an inhibitor of membrane attack complex (MAC) formation, was negative in TALL but positive in CEM. TALL was lysed efficiently only by treatment with the polyclonal anti-MCP, while CEM showed only slight lysis with the same treatment. Monoclonal antibodies to MCP, including M177, caused only minimal cell destruction. Based on these results, together with the fact that decay-accelerating factor (DAF) serves as a factor for preventing C3 attack on human cells, we conclude that MCP and DAF cooperatively protect host cells from C3 targeting and, in these T cell lines, MCP is sufficient for preventing C3 deposition even without DAF. After all, human cells undergo almost no autologous complement-mediated cytolysis if they express at least one of the functionally active inhibitors, MCP, DAF, or p18.
3 Clonotypic heterogeneity in experimental interstitial nephritis. Restricted specificity of the anti-tubular basement membrane B cell repertoire is associated with a disease-modifying crossreactive idiotype. Experimental anti-tubular basement membrane (anti-TBM) disease is an autoimmune interstitial nephritis elicited in susceptible rodents after immunization with renal tubular antigen. The nephritogenic antigen in the immunizing preparation is 3M-1, a 48,000 Mr noncollagenous glycoprotein. The hallmarks of the renal lesion are the presence of anti-TBM antibodies (anti-TBM-Ab) and a dense mononuclear cell infiltrate. The anti-TBM B cell repertoire in this disease was analyzed using a library of 22 anti-TBM mAbs generated in a prototypically susceptible Brown Norway rat. These anti-TBM mAbs were all demonstrated to be 3M-1 specific and their characterization formed the basis for the following observations: (a) The size of the anti-TBM B cell population is estimated at 58 distinct clones; (b) by competitive inhibition criteria, all anti-TBM mAbs recognize the same (or spatially close) epitope(s) on 3M-1. This focused recognition was maintained in spite of considerable variability in affinity. Epitopic dominance could also be demonstrated in human polyclonal anti-TBM antisera from a patient with anti-TBM disease; and (c) a crossreactive idiotype was documented, and antisera directed toward this set of variable region determinants was shown to be effective as a prophylactic regimen to abrogate disease, and as a therapeutic modality to arrest the progression of disease; (d) analysis of VH gene families suggested biased usage of Q52- and 7183-like families, although at least three gene families are used in the anti-TBM-Ab response. Thus, the anti-TBM B cell compartment in BN rats is moderately large, but is primarily focused to a single epitope on the nephritogenic antigen and is associated with a disease-modifying crossreactive idiotype.
3 The Mac-2 antigen is a galactose-specific lectin that binds IgE. A cDNA encoding the Mac-2 antigen, a surface marker highly expressed by thioglycollate-elicited macrophages, has been cloned by immunoscreening of a lambda gt11-P388D1 expression library. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA is identical to that of carbohydrate-binding protein 35, a galactose-specific lectin found in fibroblasts and highly homologous to a rat IgE-binding protein from basophilic leukemia cells. The in vitro synthesized Mac-2 protein displayed the expected carbohydrate- and IgE-binding properties. By pulse-chase analysis and subcellular fractionation studies, the Mac-2 protein was found in the cytosol but was also seen to accumulate in the extracellular medium. The latter finding was surprising in view of the fact that the cDNA did not encode a signal peptide or transmembrane domain. An alternatively spliced cDNA with the potential to encode a NH2 terminally extended Mac-2 protein with a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at its NH2 terminus was also found, but it is not clear whether it is the source of the extracellular Mac-2. Possible functions for the Mac-2 protein based on its lectin- and IgE-binding properties are discussed.
0 Three spontaneous H-2Db mutants are generated by genetic micro-recombination (gene conversion) events. Impact on the H-2-restricted immune responsiveness. Sequence analysis of the mutant Dbm13, Dbm14, and Dbm24 genes indicate that they differ from the parental Db gene by 4, 1, and 8 nucleotides, respectively. The mutant sequences substituted into Dbm13 and Dbm24 are identical to those found in the Kb gene, at the homologous positions. Thus, similar to the Kb gene, the Db gene is able to undergo micro-recombination (gene conversion) events with other class I genes. Such data suggest that micro-recombination events could be an important mechanism for the diversification of all H-2 genes. The Db mutant products share a common theme: the alterations in all occur at amino acid residues whose side chains in the homologous class I HLA-A2 molecule project into the postulated peptide antigen-binding cleft, and hence, would be expected to alter the binding of foreign or self peptides. Due to such changes, the bm14 mouse has become a nonresponder in the CTL response to Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), as the alteration of one amino acid residue at position 70 (a Gln to His) is sufficient to entirely abrogate the cell-mediated response to the virus. On the other hand, the bm13 mouse has shifted the major part of its M-MuLV restriction to Kb, a profound alteration in CTL responsiveness due to the alteration of three amino acids (Leu to Gln at 114, Phe to Tyr at 116, and Glu to Asp at 119) in a peptide stretch of beta-pleated sheet structure lining the bottom of the antigen-binding cleft. Thus, study of these mutants reveals that, in one step, micro-recombination at the genetic level has resulted at the protein level in profound changes in the immune response to viral infection. Such a mechanism operating at the population level can be a driving force during evolution for modulating the character of CTL immunity.
3 Role of the H-2 complex in induction of T helper cells in vivo. III. Contribution of the I-E subregion to restriction sites recognized by I-A/E-restricted T cells. Previous studies on negative selection of T cells to sheep erythrocytes in irradiated mice showed that CBA (I-Ak,I-Ek) (kk) T cells comprise two subgroups of cells restricted by I-A (A alpha-A beta) and I-A/E (E alpha-E beta) molecules. Selection of the I-A/E-restricted by I-A (A alpha-A beta) and I-A/E (E alpha-E beta) molecules. Selection of the I-A/E-restricted subset requires that the donor T cells and the selection host share both I-A (E beta) and I-E (E alpha) gene products; only the I-A-restricted cells undergo selection in B10.A(4R) (kb) mice. This paper demonstrates that negative selection of the I-A/E-restricted subgroup of CBA T cells can occur in F1 hybrids between B10.A(4R) and various Ia.7+ (E alpha+) I-E-incompatible strains; selection does not occur in hybrids between B10.A(4R) and Ia.7- (E alpha-) strains. These data suggest that, despite the fact that E alpha chains display detectable structural allelic variations, these chains are functionally nonpolymorphic. This conclusion applies to E alpha k,d,p,r,j chains. With F1 hybrids between B10.A(4R) and another Ia.7+ strain, B10.PL (H-2u), in contrast, only intermediate selection is observed. This finding is consistent with recent evidence that cell surface expression of E alpha-u-E beta dimers displays strong cis preference. In contrast to E alpha+ CBA T cells, E alpha- B10.A(4R) (kb) T cells undergo complete negative selection in hosts matched only in the I-A (and H-2K) subregion, i.e., B10.BR (kk) mice; no selection occurs in B10 (bb) mice. These data imply that Ia-restricted T cells in E alpha- strains are probably restricted solely by I-A molecules.
0 Characterization of avirulent mutant Legionella pneumophila that survive but do not multiply within human monocytes. Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, is a Gram-negative bacterium and a facultative intracellular parasite that multiplies in human monocytes and alveolar macrophages. In this paper, mutants of L. pneumophila avirulent for human monocytes were obtained and extensively characterized. The mutants were obtained by serial passage of wild-type L. pneumophila on suboptimal artificial medium. None of 44 such mutant clones were capable of multiplying in monocytes or exerting a cytopathic effect on monocyte monolayers. Under the same conditions, wild-type L. pneumophila multiplied 2.5-4.5 logs, and destroyed the monocyte monolayers. The basis for the avirulent phenotype was an inability of the mutants to multiply intracellularly. Both mutant and wild-type bacteria bound to and were ingested by monocytes, and both entered by coiling phagocytosis. Thereafter, their intracellular destinies diverged. The wild-type formed a distinctive ribosome-lined replicative phagosome, inhibited phagosome-lysosome fusion, and multiplied intracellularly. The mutant did not form the distinctive phagosome nor inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion. The mutant survived intracellularly but did not replicate in the phagolysosome. In all other respects studied, the mutant and wild-type bacteria were similar. They had similar ultrastructure and colony morphology; both formed colonies of compact and diffuse type. They had similar structural and secretory protein profiles and LPS profile by PAGE. Both the mutant and wild-type bacteria were completely resistant to human complement in the presence or absence of high titer anti-L. pneumophila antibody. The mutant L. pneumophila have tremendous potential for enhancing our understanding of the intracellular biology of L. pneumophila and other parasites that follow a similar pathway through the mononuclear phagocyte. Such mutants also show promise for enhancing our understanding of immunity to L. pneumophila, and they may serve as prototypes in the development of safe and effective vaccines against intracellular pathogens.
2 Regulatory mechanisms in cell-mediated immune responses. III. I-region control of suppressor cell interaction with responder cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Active suppression of mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) response is mediated by a soluble factor released by alloantigen-activated murine suppressor cells. Genetic restrictions controlling suppressor factor interaction with MLR responder cells were elucidated in this study. Non-H-2 genetic background was irrelevant to effective interaction. Using congenic strains and strains with intra-H-2 recombinants the genetic locus controlling suppressor T-cell-responder cell interaction was mapped in the I-C or S regions of the H-2 complex. Similarly, recombinant strains were used to exclude the presence of another suppressor cell-responder cell interaction locus in K,I-A, and I-B regions. It thus appears that the I-C subregion of the H-2 complex controls suppressive cell interactions in this T-cell-mediated immune response.
3 Mutations in the alpha 2 helix of HLA-A2 affect presentation but do not inhibit binding of influenza virus matrix peptide. Previous studies have suggested that MHC class I molecules bind and present peptides to CTL in a manner that is analogous to the presentation of peptides by class II molecules to Th. Crystallographic studies of HLA-A2 have led to the assignment of a putative peptide binding site that is bordered by two alpha helices consisting of residues 50-84 and 138-180. In this study, we have investigated whether residues in the alpha 2 helix are involved in the binding and/or presentation of a peptide to CTL. We have generated CTL to type A influenza virus by stimulation of human PBL with a synthetic peptide from the influenza A virus matrix protein (M1 residues 57-68) in the presence of rIL-2. Such HLA-A2.1-restricted influenza virus-immune CTL do not recognize infected HLA-A2.3+ targets. A2.1 and A2.3 differ by three amino acids in the alpha 2 domain: Ala vs. Thr at position 149, Val vs. Glu at position 152, and Leu vs. Trp at position 156. Site-directed mutants of the A2.1 gene that encode A2 molecules that resemble A2.3 at positions 149, 152, and 156 have been constructed, transfected into human cells, and assayed for their ability to present the M1 peptide. The results demonstrate that most, but not all, A2.1-restricted M1-peptide-specific CTL fail to recognize M1 peptide-exposed transfectants with certain single amino acid substitutions at positions 152 and 156. In contrast, M1 peptide-exposed transfectants that express A2 molecules with an Ala----Thr substitution at position 149 were recognized by all CTL tested, but they exhibited an apparent difference in the kinetics of peptide binding. These results indicate that amino acid substitutions at positions 152 and 156 of the putative peptide binding site of the A2 molecule can affect presentation without eliminating binding, and indicate that the failure to recognize complexes between the peptide and the mutant A2 molecules is due to different TCR specificities and not to the failure to bind the peptide.
3 Direct interactions between B and T lymphocytes bearing complementary receptors. A murine cloned Th cell line specific for the antigen conalbumin in the context of self I-A molecules can be activated by low concentrations of soluble antireceptor mAb. By using an antireceptor mAb to shared antigenic determinants on T cell receptors, we have shown that the ability to be activated by soluble antireceptor mAb is an unusual, although not unique, feature of this cloned T cell line. This activation does not involve occult APC, FcR, or interaction between individual cloned T cells, as limiting-dilution analysis shows that individual cells of this clone will grow in the presence of the antireceptor antibody and IL-1 as stimulus. This cloned T cell line is highly immunogenic in vivo, giving rise to antireceptor antibodies that stimulate its growth in both mice and rats. This response is not dependent upon exogenous T cells. Rather, the clone directly interacts with complementary B cells, as shown by the production of mAb in nude mice, and by production of stimulating antireceptor antibodies by purified B cells cultured with cloned Th cells in vitro. Several features of this cloned Th cell line, most especially its ability to be activated, rather than inhibited, by antireceptor antibodies, may account for its striking ability to directly activate B cells bearing complementary receptors. The direct interaction of the cloned Th cell with B cells bearing complementary receptors may serve as a model for receptor-receptor interactions in the generation of both T and B cell repertoires.
1 Extensive deletions and insertions in different MHC supratypes detected by pusled field gel electrophoresis. The genomic organization of the human MHC was examined in multiple examples of six different supratypes using pulsed field electrophoresis (PFGE) after digestion of genomic DNA with infrequency cutting restriction endonucleases. Differences in restriction fragment length and band intensity were shown to be specific for each supratype. Mapping of the MHC revealed that each supratype contains previously undescribed deletions and insertions between HLA B and DQ regions.
3 Yersinia controls type III effector delivery into host cells by modulating Rho activity. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis binds to beta1 integrin receptors, and uses the type III secretion proteins YopB and YopD to introduce pores and to translocate Yop effectors directly into host cells. Y. pseudotuberculosis lacking effectors that inhibit Rho GTPases, YopE and YopT, have high pore forming activity. Here, we present evidence that Y. pseudotuberculosis selectively modulates Rho activity to induce cellular changes that control pore formation and effector translocation. Inhibition of actin polymerization decreased pore formation and YopE translocation in HeLa cells infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis. Inactivation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 by treatment with Clostridium difficile toxin B inhibited pore formation and YopE translocation in infected HeLa cells. Expression of a dominant negative form of Rac did not reduce the uptake of membrane impermeable dyes in HeLa cells infected with a pore forming strain YopEHJT(-). Similarly, the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 did not decrease pore formation or translocation, although it efficiently hindered Rac-dependent bacterial uptake. In contrast, C. botulinum C3 potently reduced pore formation and translocation, implicating Rho A, B, and/or C in the control of the Yop delivery. An invasin mutant (Y. pseudotuberculosis invD911E) that binds to beta1 integrins, but inefficiently transduces signals through the receptors, was defective for YopE translocation. Interfering with the beta1 integrin signaling pathway, by inhibiting Src kinase activity, negatively affected YopE translocation. Additionally, Y. pseudotuberculosis infection activated Rho by a mechanism that was dependent on YopB and on high affinity bacteria interaction with beta1 integrin receptors. We propose that Rho activation, mediated by signals triggered by the YopB/YopD translocon and from engagement of beta1 integrin receptors, stimulates actin polymerization and activates the translocation process, and that once the Yops are translocated, the action of YopE or YopT terminate delivery of Yops and prevents pore formation.
3 Localization of paternal H-2K antigens on murine trophoblast cells in vivo. We have previously shown the presence of H-2K and D antigens of both parental haplotypes on dispersed murine trophoblast cells. The question still remained whether such antigens are sequestered away from the sinusoidal face of these cells making them inert as allografts. The in vivo expression of H-2 antigens on these cells was therefore examined radioautographically after perfusion of 125I-labeled monoclonal and anti-H-2Kk (anti-paternal) antibody directly into individual placental branches of the uterine artery suppling 15-d-old (C57BL/6J female) X CBA/J male) placentae. Syngeneic C57BL/6J placentae served as negative controls. A radioautographic examination of 0.5-micrometer-thick sections revealed specific labeling of labyrinthine trophoblasts lining the sinusoids of allogeneic placentae. Most of this labeling was localized to the sinusoidal face of the cells as opposed to a weak labeling of the intracellular aspect. Spongiotrophoblasts and trophoblast giant cells did not label, but specific labeling of fetal capillary endothelium and some macrophages was also noted.
3 Beta transforming growth factors are potential regulators of B lymphopoiesis. Members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family of polypeptides were found to be potent in vitro inhibitors of kappa light chain expression on normal bone marrow-derived and transformed cloned pre-B cells, and of the maturation of these cells to mitogen responsiveness. The inhibition by TGF-beta was selective in that Ia expression was not blocked. Together with the observations that LPS, IL-1, NZB serum factors, IL-4, and IFN-gamma preferentially induced either kappa or Ia, or both, on a pre-B cell line, these results further suggest that acquisition of Ig and class II molecules is independently controlled by different antagonists as well as agonists. In addition, kappa chain induction by IFN-gamma does not appear to be as sensitive to TGF-beta downregulation as that stimulated by other factors tested, and this raises the possibility that activation of the same gene may result from different transmembrane signaling pathways. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta on kappa acquisition by pre-B cells and on kappa increase after exposure of mature B cells to LPS, as measured by kappa RNA levels and/or surface fluorescence, no inhibition was observed on unstimulated spleen B cells or on two cloned B cell lines that constitutively produce kappa. Thus, TGF-beta may function during specific stages of B cell differentiation by inhibiting initiation of, or increased transcription of Ig genes, and therefore, may be an important negative regulator of B lymphopoiesis. It is the first natural substance found to have this effect.
1 Multiple molecular forms of human lactoferrin. Identification of a class of lactoferrins that possess ribonuclease activity and lack iron-binding capacity. Lactoferrin (Lf), the major iron-binding component of milk, also a major constituent of the specific granules of neutrophils involved in antimicrobial activity and a glycoprotein thought to play a role in regulatory functions in the hematopoietic system as well as other physiologic activities, is shown to occur in three isoforms. One, Lf-alpha, binds iron; the other two, Lf-beta and Lf-gamma, express potent RNase activity, but do not bind iron. The three isoforms are very similar or identical in Mr, pI, partial proteolytic peptide patterns, NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, and reactivity with mAbs and polyclonal antisera against the RNase and Lf, respectively. The finding of structurally similar but enzymatically distinct forms of Lf may be related to the diverse functions of the molecule.
3 Fibronectin tetrapeptide is target for syphilis spirochete cytadherence. The syphilis bacterium, Treponema pallidum, parasitizes host cells through recognition of fibronectin (Fn) on cell surfaces. The active site of the Fn molecule has been identified as a four-amino acid sequence, arg-gly-asp-ser (RGDS), located on each monomer of the cell-binding domain. The synthetic heptapeptide gly-arg-gly-asp-ser-pro-cys (GRGDSPC), with the active site sequence RGDS, specifically competed with 125I-labeled cell-binding domain acquisition by T. pallidum. Additionally, the same heptapeptide with the RGDS sequence diminished treponemal attachment to HEp-2 and HT1080 cell monolayers. Related heptapeptides altered in one key amino acid within the RGDS sequence failed to inhibit Fn cell-binding domain acquisition or parasitism of host cells by T. pallidum. The data support the view that T. pallidum cytadherence of host cells is through recognition of the RGDS sequence also important for eukaryotic cell-Fn binding.
0 Psychiatric rating scales in Urdu: a systematic review. Researchers setting out to conduct research employing questionnaires in non-English speaking populations need instruments that have been validated in the indigenous languages. In this study we have tried to review the literature on the status of cross-cultural and/or criterion validity of all the questionnaires measuring psychiatric symptoms available in Urdu language. A search of Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and http://www.pakmedinet.com was conducted using the search terms; Urdu psychiatric rating scale, and Urdu and Psychiatry. References of retrieved articles were searched. Only studies describing either cross-cultural or criterion validation of a questionnaire in Urdu measuring psychiatric symptoms were included. Thirty two studies describing validation of 19 questionnaires were identified. Six of these questionnaires were developed indigenously in Urdu while thirteen had been translated from English. Of the six indigenous questionnaires five had had their criterion validity examined. Of the thirteen translated questionnaires only four had had both their cross-cultural and criterion validity assessed. There is a paucity of validated questionnaires assessing psychiatric symptoms in Urdu. The BSI, SRQ and AKUADS are the questionnaires that have been most thoroughly evaluated in Urdu.
3 Stages of B cell differentiation in human lymphoid tissue. Monoclonal antibodies reactive with B cell-specific differentiation and other antigens were used to investigate stages of B cell maturation in human lymphoid tissue, using an immunoperoxidase technique on frozen tissue sections. Lymphoid follicles, which represent the major anatomic compartment of B cells, demonstrated cellular antigenic expressions that appear to reflect differentiation of B cells. The majority of cells in the primary follicles and the mantle zones of secondary follicles expressed surface antigens similar to those of circulating B cells, namely IgM, IgD, Ia, B1, and B2. In contrast, the germinal center cells of secondary follicles stained for IgM, IgG, B1, B2, and Ia antigens, but not for IgD, and furthermore, acquired the T10 antigen. The germinal centers stained much more intensely than mantle zones with anti-B2, whereas no such striking difference in the staining intensity was observed with anti B1. Plasma cells, which represent the end stage of B cell differentiation, showed intense cytoplasmic staining with the anti-T10 antibody. The results indicate that the generation of germinal center cells in primary lymphoid follicles involves phenotype changes that correspond largely to those previously observed after both antigenic and mitogenic activation of B lymphocytes.
1 Autoantibodies to the constitutive 73-kD member of the hsp70 family of heat shock proteins in systemic lupus erythematosus. Serum from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) frequently contain IgM and IgG autoantibodies to the constitutively expressed 73-kD/pI 5.5 member of the hsp70 family of heat shock proteins, as determined by one-dimensional (SDS-PAGE) and two-dimensional (IEF/SDS-PAGE) immunoblotting, and by solid-phase SLE Ig immunoprecipitation experiments using hsp70 protein-specific mAbs as probes. Autoantibodies to hsp70 also were detected in a minority of sera from patients with other rheumatic or viral diseases, but not in normal sera. These data may provide additional insight into etiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms in this and related autoimmune disorders.
1 Isolation, characterization, and propagation in vitro of human glomerular endothelial cells. Human glomerular endothelial cells have been isolated, cloned, and characterized. They appeared as the first outgrowth from human glomeruli in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor, which was also a requirement for continuous growth. By phase microscopy they appeared as monolayers of polygonal cells. Von Willebrand's factor (VWF) was detected in the cytoplasm of all clones. Their intermediate filaments differed antigenically from that present in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Like other endothelial cells, they demonstrated high levels of membrane-associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
3 Origin of human T-lymphotrophic virus I-positive T cell lines in adult T cell leukemia. Analysis of T cell receptor gene rearrangement. Using the clone-specific rearrangement of the T cell receptor gene as the genetic marker of the clonotype, we analyzed the clonal origin of the interleukin 2 (IL-2)-dependent human T-lymphotrophic virus I (HTLV-I)-positive T cell lines established from various adult T cell leukemia (ATL) patients. From a patient with chronic ATL, whose leukemic cells proliferated in vitro in response to IL-2, we repeatedly established leukemic T cell clones having the same rearrangement profile of the T beta chain gene as the leukemic cells. By contrast, established cell lines from acute ATL patients had different beta chain gene rearrangements from those of the leukemic cells. These HTLV-I+ T cell lines might not be the direct progeny of the leukemic cells, but that of T cells infected either in vivo or in vitro. These IL-2-reactive nonleukemic T cells might have been selected in vitro, because their leukemic cells failed to respond to IL-2, despite the expression of IL-2 receptor. The analysis of the T cell receptor gene rearrangement may give a new approach for the elucidation of the mechanism of leukemogenesis and the origin of the HTLV-I+ T cell lines in ATL.
1 Measles infection of human mononuclear cells. I. Acute infection of peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes. A study of the susceptibility of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to measles virus infection and replication is reported. Resting lymphocytes obtained from adults showed very low levels of infection and virus replication while lymphocytes activated by plant mitogens or allogenic lymphocytes supported mononuclear cells obtained from the umbilical cord of healthy neonates were more susceptible to measles virus infection than those of adults; however, activated cord lymphocytes supported viral replication in the range observed with adult activated lymphocytes. Monocytes obtained from adults were relatively resistant to measles virus infection and replication while neonatal cord blood monocytes supported viral replication to the degree observed with activated lymphocytes. It is hypothesized that infection of acitivated lymphocytes may explain the depression of cell-mediated immunity seen during acute measles virus infection. The significance of the finding that neonatal monocytes are more susceptible to viral infection and replication than adult monocytes is discussed.
3 Health-seeking behaviour of human brucellosis cases in rural Tanzania. Brucellosis is known to cause debilitating conditions if not promptly treated. In some rural areas of Tanzania however, practitioners give evidence of seeing brucellosis cases with symptoms of long duration. The purpose of this study was to establish health-seeking behaviour of human brucellosis cases in rural Tanzania and explore the most feasible ways to improve it. This was designed as a longitudinal study. Socio-demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected from patients who reported to selected hospitals in rural northern Tanzania between June 2002 and April 2003. All patients with conditions suspicious of brucellosis on the basis of preliminary clinical examination and history were enrolled into the study as brucellosis suspects. Blood samples were taken and tested for brucellosis using the Rose-Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and other agglutination tests available at the health facilities and the competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) test at the Veterinary Laboratory Agencies (VLA) in the UK. All suspects who tested positive with the c-ELISA test were regarded as brucellosis cases. A follow-up of 49 cases was made to collect data on health-seeking behaviour of human brucellosis cases. The majority of cases 87.7% gave a history of going to hospital as the first point of care, 10.2% purchased drugs from a nearby drug shop before going to hospital and 2% went to a local traditional healer first. Brucellosis cases delayed going to hospital with a median delay time of 90 days, and with 20% of the cases presenting to hospitals more than a year after the onset of symptoms. Distance to the hospital, keeping animals and knowledge of brucellosis were significantly associated with patient delay to present to hospital. More efforts need to be put on improving the accessibility of health facilities to the rural poor people who succumb to most of the diseases including zoonoses. Health education on brucellosis in Tanzania should also stress the importance of early presentation to hospitals for prompt treatment.
3 Role of superoxide anion radicals in ethanol metabolism by blood monocyte-derived human macrophages. The effects of a number of additives on the rate of conversion of ethanol (1 mg/ml; 21.7 mM) to acetate by monolayers of blood monocyte-derived human macrophages were investigated. The additives studied were superoxide dismutase (SOD; 1,500 U/ml), catalase (1,500 U/ml), tetrahydrofurane (20 mM), and PMA (20 nM), either singly or in various combinations. SOD, catalase, SOD plus catalase, tetrahydrofurane, and tetrahydrofurane plus SOD inhibited ethanol oxidation by 49.2, 12.1, 52.9, 60.4, and 66.8%, respectively. PMA caused a 4.0-8.3-fold increase in the rate of ethanol metabolism and this increase was completely suppressed in the presence of SOD. The data indicate that a substantial proportion of the ethanol metabolism by both unstimulated and PMA-stimulated blood monocyte-derived macrophages was dependent on the generation of superoxide anion radicals.
3 Antigenic domains of the streptococcal Pep M5 protein. Localization of epitopes crossreactive with type 6 M protein and identification of a hypervariable region of the M molecule. Pep M5, the pepsin-derived N-terminal half of the group A streptococcal type 5 M protein exhibits immunologic crossreaction with type 6 M protein, localizing some of the M6-crossreactive epitope(s) within this segment of the M5 protein. Based on the amino acid sequence of the Pep M5 protein, two structurally distinct domains have been recognized within its coiled-coil structure. We have now found that peptides derived from both the structurally distinct domains of the Pep M5 protein contain antigenic epitopes. Furthermore, only the peptides from the C-terminal domain of the Pep M5 protein crossreacted with rabbit anti-M6 sera, whereas those from the N-terminal domain did not. Consistent with this, sequence analyses of the arginyl peptides of the Pep M6 protein, the pepsin-derived N-terminal half of the M6 protein, revealed extensive homology of some of these peptides with regions within the C-terminal domain of the Pep M5 molecule. While an arginyl peptide of the Pep M6 protein exhibits 84% homology with region 150-186 of the Pep M5 protein, the C-terminal hexadecapeptide of the Pep M6 protein is virtually identical with the corresponding region of the Pep M5 protein. These results are suggestive of conformational similarities in the region around the pepsin-susceptible site within the M5 and M6 proteins. In addition, one or more epitopes of the M5 protein that are crossreactive with the M6 protein may be placed close to the pepsin-susceptible site of the M5 protein. Previous studies have suggested the N-terminal half of the M proteins to be the variable part of the molecule among the different M protein serotypes. The present results suggest that the N-terminal quarter of the M protein may represent the hypervariable domain of the M molecule.
3 An endogenous processing pathway in vaccinia virus-infected cells for presentation of cytoplasmic antigens to class II-restricted T cells. The recognition of virus-infected cells by class I MHC-restricted cytotoxic T cells requires endogenous processing of antigen for presentation. It is still unclear whether endogenous processing of antigen can be utilized by class II MHC molecules for presentation. To test this possibility, a human B cell line expressing HLA-A2 and HLA-DR1 was infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the Influenza A virus M1 matrix protein (VAC-M1) and was assayed for lysis by different M1-specific cytolytic T cell lines, restricted by either HLA-A2 or by HLA-DR1. Class II-restricted lysis of VAC-M1-infected cells did occur. This lysis required de novo M1 synthesis and was not due to exogenous antigen. Several properties of the endogenous processing pathway for class II-restricted presentation were different from those of the pathway utilized by class I molecules. First, class II-mediated recognition of VAC-M1 infected cells was less efficient, requiring higher doses of virus and longer infection times, than the class I-mediated recognition. Second, chloroquine completely blocked presentation of endogenous M1 to class II-restricted T cells but had no effect on the class I-restricted presentation. Third, the class II-restricted presentation of M1 was only mildly affected by Brefeldin A, a drug that prevents transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, whereas the class I-restricted presentation of M1 was completely abrogated by this drug. These data demonstrate the existence of an endogenous processing pathway for the presentation of cytosolic antigen by class II molecules and show that this pathway is distinct from the one used for presentation by class I molecules.
0 Coolidge effect in pond snails: male motivation in a simultaneous hermaphrodite. The simultaneously hermaphroditic pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, can mate in the male and female role, but within one copulation only one sexual role is performed at a time. Previous work has shown that male motivation is determined by the availability of seminal fluid in the prostate gland, which is detected via a nervous connection by the brain area controlling male behaviour. Based on this knowledge, patterns of sexual role alternations within mating pairs can be explained. The data presented here reveal that these snails can donate and receive sperm several times within 24 hours, and that they have increased mating rates in larger groups (i.e. more mating opportunities). For mating pairs we show, by introducing novel mating partners after copulation, that animals do inseminate new partners, while they are no longer motivated to inseminate their original partners. Our findings provide the first direct evidence for higher motivation in a hermaphrodite to copulate when a new partner is encountered. This Coolidge effect seems to be attenuated when mucus trails are excluded, which suggests that a chemical or textural cue may be responsible for mediating this response to sperm competition.
3 Tumor-promoting phorbol esters selectively abrogate the expression of the T4 differentiation antigen expressed on normal and malignant (Sézary) T helper lymphocytes. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) selectively abrogates, in nanomolar concentrations, the expression of the T4 differentiation antigen, as defined by the monoclonal anti-T4 antibody (1) on Il-2-producing T helper lymphocytes from normal donors and on T helper lymphocytes from a patient with malignant T cell lymphoma (Sézary's syndrome); this compound does not affect the expression of cell surface antigens as defined by the antibodies anti-OKT3, -T6, -T8, -T11, Ia, or anti-surface immunoglobulin. Abrogation of the T4 antigen expression is concentration dependent, completed within 8 h of incubation at 37 degrees C, does not occur at 4 degrees C, and is reversible. Only those phorbol-esters known to have tumor-promoting activity in vivo (2) affect the T4 antigen, whereas nonpromoting compounds are ineffective.
0 Conventional B cells, not B-1 cells, are responsible for producing autoantibodies in lpr mice. Mice homozygous for the lpr gene develop autoantibodies and polyclonal B cell activation similar to what is seen in human systemic lupus erythematosus patients. We have previously shown that an lpr-specific intrinsic B cell defect was necessary for autoantibody production in this model. In the current study, we have further defined these autoantibody-producing B cells. Two major subsets of B cells have been described. B-1 cells (CD5+ B cells) can be distinguished from conventional B cells on the basis of phenotype, cytokine secretion, gene expression, anatomical location, and function. In addition, B-1 cells have been implicated in autoimmunity in several murine and human studies. To address the question of which B cell subset produces autoantibodies in lpr mice, we used immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) allotype-marked peritoneal (B-1 cell source) and bone marrow (conventional B cell source) cells from lpr mice to establish B cell chimeras. We used two general approaches. In one, we reconstituted sublethally irradiated mice with B-1 cells of one allotype and bone marrow cells of another allotype. In the second method, we suppressed endogenous B cells in neonatal mice with allotype-specific anti-IgM antibody, and injected peritoneal cells of another allotype. After antibody treatment was stopped, the mouse's conventional B cells recovered, but the B-1 subset was only reconstituted by the donor. In both types of chimeras, antichromatin, rheumatoid factor, and anti-single stranded DNA (ssDNA) autoantibodies were produced by the conventional B cell bone marrow source. In addition, an age-related decrease in peritoneal B-1 cells was seen, even in unmanipulated lpr mice. These data show that lpr B-1 cells are not important producers of autoantibodies. Conventional B cells are the source of autoantibodies directed at chromatin, ssDNA, and IgG.
2 T cell requirements for the rejection of renal allografts bearing an isolated class I MHC disparity. This study has examined the cellular and humoral responses underlying the rejection of rat renal allografts bearing an isolated RT1Aa class I MHC disparity. RT1Aa disparate kidneys were rejected promptly by high responder RT1u but not by low responder RT1c recipients (median survival time 10 d and greater than 100 d, respectively). The magnitude and phenotype of the cellular infiltrate were similar in rejecting and nonrejecting RT1Aa disparate kidneys. Paradoxically, graft infiltrating cells and spleen cells from RT1u recipients showed minimal ability to lyse donor strain lymphoblasts in vitro, whereas effector cells from RT1c recipients showed modest levels of cytotoxicity. Injection of RT1u rats with MRC OX8 mAb was highly effective at selectively depleting CD8+ cells from graft recipients but had no effect in prolonging the survival of RT1Aa disparate grafts despite the complete absence of CD8+ cells from the graft infiltrate, which included numerous CD4+ T cells and macrophages. RT1u, but not RT1c, recipients mounted a strong alloantibody response against RT1Aa disparate kidneys. Immune serum obtained from RT1u recipients that had rejected a RT1Aa disparate graft was able, when injected into cyclosporin-treated RT1u recipients, to restore their ability to reject a RT1Aa, but not a third-party RT1c, kidney. These results suggest that CD8+ cells in general and CD8+ cytotoxic effector cells in particular are unnecessary for the rapid rejection of RT1Aa class I disparate kidney grafts by high responder RT1u recipients. By implication, CD4+ T cells alone are sufficient to cause prompt rejection of such grafts and they may do so by providing T cell help for the generation of alloantibody.
3 Genetical control of B-cell responses. IV. Inheritance of the unresponsiveness to lipopolysaccharides. The inheritance of B-cell responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was studied in 55 crosses between mice of the low-responder strain C3H/HeJ and the high-responder strains B10.5M and C3H/Tif. F1 hybrid mice between the low-and the high-responder strains, showed in every case responses which were intermediate between the responses obtained with each parent. The responsiveness among F2 hybrid and backcross mice to either high- or low-responder parents, segregated into intermediate, high, or low categories, respectively. The present results are compatible with the hypothesis that responsiveness to LPS is determined by one single, codominantly expressed, autosomal gene. The capacity to develop a specific thymus-independent response to a hapten-LPS conjugate, also under genetical control, was found to segregate together with the capacity to develop polyclonal responses to LPS.
0 Cyclical antiidiotypic response to anti-hormone antibodies due to neutralization by autologous anti-antiidiotype antibodies that bind hormone. Antiidiotype antibodies were raised against anti-catecholamine ligand antibodies. The antiidiotype response was shown to be cyclical and to correspond to the production of antibodies that could bind to catecholamine beta-adrenergic receptors and stimulate adenylate cyclase. Disappearance of these antibodies from the serum could be correlated with the appearance of a catecholamine ligand-binding activity corresponding to the synthesis of autologous anti-antiidiotype antibodies directed against the induced antiidiotypic molecules. Comparison of the injected versus the induced anti-ligand antibodies reveals striking differences in affinities but similarities in the ability to bind to the antiidiotype antibodies and to the ligand-containing affinity gel. The results support the existence of a functional network of idiotype antiidiotype interactions involving external as well as internal antigens, antibodies, and possibly other types of molecules involved in recognition phenomena, such as hormone receptors.
3 Extracellular matrix-modulated expression of human cell surface glycoproteins A42 and J143. Intrinsic and extrinsic signals determine antigenic phenotype. We have used serologic, biochemical, and genetic methods to characterize two stage-specific human differentiation antigens of neural and melanocytic cells: A42 (57,000 Mr glycoprotein) and J143 (140,000/30,000 Mr glycoprotein). The genes determining A42 and J143 cell surface expression in rodent-human hybrids were chromosomally mapped, and the respective human chromosomes were introduced into rodent cells derived from distinct differentiation lineages. Serologic analysis of the resulting hybrid clones has permitted the identification of two types of regulatory signals determining A42 and J143 expression. First, both antigens are expressed in hybrids constructed with antigen-positive human cells and also in certain hybrids constructed with antigen-negative human cells, indicating that intrinsic signals provided by the differentiation program of the rodent fusion partner induce antigen expression. Second, a series of human-mouse neuroblastoma hybrids, which are A42- or J143- when cultured on plastic surfaces, can be induced to express the antigens when cultured on substrates coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by bovine corneal endothelial cells or fibronectin. This induction of antigen expression by extrinsic, ECM-derived signals is accompanied in the neuroblastoma hybrids by increased substrate adhesiveness and cell spreading and by characteristic changes in cell morphology. A similar program of phenotypic changes is also seen in spontaneous variants of human neuroblastoma and Ewing's sarcoma cells and in ECM-induced Ewing's sarcoma cells. These findings suggest that ECM-derived signals have a role analogous to mitogens and soluble differentiation factors in modulating differentiation phenotypes and tissue-specific patterns of cell surface antigen expression.
3 Interactions between T helper cells and dendritic cells during the rat mixed lymphocyte reaction. This paper describes the interactions between dendritic cells (DC) and T helper (Th) cells in the rat mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Th blasts that are actively proliferating were generated in a 5 d primary MLR; resting Th memory cells were derived from a 10-12 d MLR. The DC were purified from thoracic duct lymph derived from rats whose mesenteric lymph nodes had been removed. The results show that DC are the major stimulators in the primary MLR and also for the restimulation of Th blasts and Th memory cells. Th blasts rapidly formed large clusters when cultured with DC but not with Ia+ macrophages or B cells. This interaction was not dependent on a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) difference between the T blasts and the DC. Con A-activated T and B blasts also formed clusters when cultured with DC. Th memory cells formed small clusters with DC, but, in a different assay in which clusters are dispersed, we detected an antigen-specific interaction between Th memory cells and DC. The monoclonal antibodies W3/25 (anti-rat CD4) and MRC OX-6 (anti-MHC class II) blocked proliferation in the primary MLR and also inhibited the restimulation of Th memory cells. However, the restimulation of Th blasts in a secondary MLR was only blocked by MRC OX-6. These results suggest that there are different requirements for the restimulation of T blasts than for the activation of primary or memory Th cells. W3/25 and MRC OX-6 did not affect the clustering of T blasts with DC but they both inhibited the antigen-specific binding of Th memory cells to DC. The data suggest that the CD4 (W3/25) antigen is involved in antigen-specific interactions between Th cells and DC.
3 Cytotoxic T lymphocytes produce immune interferon in response to antigen or mitogen. Interferon (IFN) was found to be secreted by cloned lines of murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes in response to mitogenic or antigen specific stimulation. The IFN produced was shown to be of the immune type based on its sensitivity to pH 2.0 and on the ability of an antiserum to immune IFN to neutralize the antiviral activity.
3 Association of HL-A 5 and immune responsiveness in vitro to streptococcal antigens. Lymphocytes, from randomly selected individuals having normal immune function, when incubated in vitro with varying concentrations of streptococcal antigens, responded in three ways: (a) response over the entire antigen concentration range, i.e., responders; (b) low response to only the highest antigen concentrations; and (c) no response at any antigen concentration. Frequency distribution analysis of these groups indicated that a significant association occurred between the ability to respond and HL-A 5.
1 Purification and partial characterization of the nephritis strain-associated protein from Streptococcus pyogenes, group A. We report the isolation and purification of the nephritis strain-associated protein (NSAP) first described by Villareal et al. (8). Amino acid analysis, and determination of the first 21 amino-terminal amino acids indicated that this 46 kD protein is a streptokinase. Biochemical analysis confirmed that NSAP could act as a plasminogen activator; immunological investigations indicated that NSAP is antigenically different from streptokinase from group C streptococcus, and possibly represents a unique streptokinase. It is this uniqueness that may contribute to the role of NSAP in the pathogenesis of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
3 Monoclonal antibodies against viral determinants are not restricted to the K/D end of the major histocompatibility complex. Monoclonal antibodies against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a natural, high-replicating, noncytolytic pathogen in mice, were obtained from fusions between myeloma cells and lymphoid cells of mice of different H-2 haplotypes at various times (4-24 d) after infection. Supernatants from growing hybridomas were tested in a RIA, and approximately 15% of all supernatants were positive when tested for specificity on infected vs. uninfected cells of different haplotypes. Upon retesting for specific fluorescence, only some RIA+ supernatants exhibited specific surface staining of acetone-fixed infected cells or unfixed infected cells. In all these experiments and using various detection methods we could not find antibodies with any preference of recognition of viral antigen in conjunction with the H-2 haplotype of the responder mouse. The absence of H-2 restricted antibodies after a primary virus infection in vivo, whether assayed by RIA or surface immunofluorescence, suggests that antibodies obtained in other experiments using infected tumor cells for induction and in the RIA may not represent the general case.
3 Inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages by certain mycobacteria can be explained by inhibition of lysosomal movements observed after phagocytosis. We have investigated the mechanism of the inhibition of phagosome-lysosome (P-L) fusion in macrophages known to occur after infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and by the mouse pathogen Mycobacterium microti. We have used an M. microti infection and have studied, first, the saltatory movements of periphagosomal secondary lysosomes by means of visual phase-contrast microscopy (a similar use of the method having been previously supported by computer analyses). The movements became slow or static after ingestion of live but not of heat-killed M. microti. They were unaffected by a fusiogenic mycobacterium M. lepraemurium. Second, we studied the behavior of a normally fusiogenic unrelated organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, after its phagocytosis by cells already containing live M. microti ingested 18 h previously. We observed, using a fluorescent assay of fusion, that many of these yeast phagosomes now also failed to fuse with the lysosomes; in contrast, when the host M. microti had been heat killed the yeast phagosomes fused normally. These observations were extended by ultrastructural quantitative analyses of P-L fusion, which confirmed the nonfusion of phagosomes of live M. microti and, more particularly, the change to nonfusion from the normal fusion behavior of the separate phagosomes of accompanying yeasts. Third, we have assembled evidence against the likelihood that these M. microti-induced phenomena are nonspecific, i.e., secondary to a general depression of activity of heavily infected host cells. The evidence includes the feasibility of adjusting the degree of infection so as to facilitate visual assessment of organelle movements without the presence of detectable damage to the cells studied; the absence of lysosomal stasis after comparable infection with another mycobacterium of comparable virulence (M. lepraemurium); and the reversibility of the stasis. We conclude that inhibition of lysosome saltatory movements (and consequently its secondary effect on the associated yeasts) is a significant, specifically induced phenomenon. From these observations and considerations, therefore, in conjunction with the analogous inhibition of lysosomal movements in normal macrophages by some chemical inhibitors of P-L fusion, and our suggestion that this association is causally related, we now suggest that M. microti-induced focal lysosomal stasis is also the main means by which the inhibition of P-L fusion is brought about by this organism. This concept is strengthened by the observations on S. cerevisiae, which provide strong evidence that stasis can cause suppression of fusion.
3 Expression of an idiotype (Id-460) during in vivo anti-dinitrophenyl antibody responses. II. Transient idiotypic dominance. After immunization of mice with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-ovalbumin (DNP-OVA), it was shown previously that strains having Igh-Va genes and able to express light chains of the Vk1 group produce high levels of anti-DNP antibody bearing an idiotype (Id-460) associated with the combining site of the BALB/c DNP-binding myeloma protein MOPC 460. Expression of Id-460 in serum is transient; Id-460 levels peak early in the response and are regulated independently of total anti-DNP antibody. In this paper, the transient dominance of Id-460 expression has been confirmed at the cellular level by inhibition of splenic anti-DNP plaque-forming cells (PFC) with rabbit anti-Id-460 antiserum. Id-460+ PFC can account for 52-91% of anti-DNP PFC early after secondary challenge with DNP-OVA. Furthermore, Id-460 is represented at these high levels in IgM, IgG, and IgG1, and IgG2a, the three isotypes tested in the PFC assay, as well as in IgE, as tested by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Thus, there is no preferential association of Id-460 with a given isotype. We conclude from these studies that Id-460 is a dominant idiotype in the anti-DNP antibody response of BALB/c mice to DNP-OVA. This dominance is expressed transiently and is independent of isotype. A further conclusion from these studies is that regulation of isotype expression is independent of the regulation of idiotype expression in this system. We would suggest that regulation of Id-460 expression involves Ig-dependent helper T cells specific for Id-460 that induce Id-460+ B cells and also activate suppressor T cells, both events occurring via idiotype-anti-idiotype interactions.
3 Recombinant interleukin 7, pre-B cell growth factor, has costimulatory activity on purified mature T cells. The activation of highly purified murine peripheral T cells in vitro by Con A is dependent on a co-stimulatory signal that is not IL-1 or IL-2. Previous evidence has demonstrated that the recently defined lymphokine IL-6 could provide costimulatory activity for purified T cells cultured with Con A. In this report we demonstrate that IL-7 also has potent co-stimulatory activity for purified murine T cells, as well as its previously described ability to support the growth of pre-B cells in Witte-Whitlock cultures. When rIL-7 was added to cultures of purified T cells together with Con A, it induced the expression of IL-2 receptors, IL-2 production, and consequently proliferation. In addition, IL-7 exhibited the same magnitude of activity in this assay as IL-6. Also, anti-IL-6 antibody which inhibited the IL-6-induced response had no effect on the IL-7 response. Thus, IL-7 does not act by inducing IL-6. These results demonstrate that IL-7, a potent growth stimulus for pre-B cells, also has a role in T cell activation.
3 Cross-reactive lysis of trinitrophenyl (TNP)-derivatized H-2 incompatible target cells by cytolytic T lymphocytes generated against syngeneic TNP spleen cells. Normal spleen cells, when cultured with irradiated trinitrophenyl (TNP)-derivatized syngeneic spleen cells, develop cytotoxic effectors that lyse most effectiviely a TNP-derivatized target that is H-2 compatible with the effector. However, these effectors also lyse to a lesser extent TNP tumor and TNP spleen targets that are H-2 incompatible. This cross-reactive lysis correlates with the degree of cytolysis seen on the TNP-derivatized syngeneic target; it appears to be medicated by Thy 1.2-bearing cells and is inhibited by antisera to the K and/or D loci of the target cell and not by antisera to non-K or non-D surface antigens. Nonradiolabeled TNP-derivatized lymphoid cells syngeneic to either the stimulator or the target are able to competitively inhibit cross-reactive lysis, while TNP chicken red blood cells are unable to specifically inhibit lysis. These data on cross-reactive lysis of TNP-conjugated targets are most consistent with the altered-self hypothesis.
2 Evidence that the T cell repertoire of normal rats contains cells with the potential to cause diabetes. Characterization of the CD4+ T cell subset that inhibits this autoimmune potential. Diabetes was induced in a normal nonautoimmune rat strain by rendering the animals relatively T cell deficient using a protocol of adult thymectomy and sublethal gamma irradiation. All male rats and 70% of females developed an acute syndrome with severe loss of weight and hyperglycemia. Diabetes in these lymphopoenic rats was associated with extensive insulitis involving CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages. The CD8+ T cells were essential for the development of diabetes but not insulitis. The autoimmune diabetes and insulitis were completely prevented by the injection of a particular CD4+ T cell subset, isolated from healthy syngeneic donors, of the phenotype CD45RClow T cell receptor alpha/beta+ RT6+ Thy-1- OX-40-. Cells of this protective phenotype, which make up about 5% of thoracic duct lymphocytes, were found to provide help for secondary antibody responses and produce interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-4, but no interferon gamma, on in vitro activation. These data provide evidence for the presence of autoreactive T cells in the normal immune system of the rat and reveal that in the intact animal these cells are prevented from expressing their autoreactive potential by other T cells.
2 Failure of clonal deletion in neonatally thymectomized mice: tolerance is preserved through clonal anergy. Self-tolerance is achieved in part through intrathymic deletion of self-reactive T cells. The necessity of the thymus for this process is suggested by the development of autoimmune diseases in neonatally thymectomized (neoTx) mice and by the failure of clonal deletion in nude mice. Indeed, the present study demonstrates that neonatal thymectomy on day 3 after birth results in the failure of clonal deletion of V beta 11+ T cells in BALB/c mice and V beta 5+ and V beta 6+ T cells in DBA/2 mice. However, these potentially autoreactive cells are nonfunctional as measured by proliferation and lymphokine production after stimulation with appropriate anti-V beta mAbs or stimulator cells. It appears that this induction of nonresponsiveness may have occurred extrathymically: the early neonatal thymus (presumably the source of the peripheral T cells observed in neoTx mice) also contains T cells with self-reactive receptors, but these cells are fully functional. Therefore, neonatal thymectomy aborts deletion of self-reactive T cells, but self-tolerance is maintained through functional inactivation of potentially self-reactive clones.
1 Purification and characterization of the major iron-regulated protein expressed by pathogenic Neisseriae. This report describes a method to purify the major iron-regulated protein (MIRP) expressed by N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. This purification procedure involves maximal expression of the MIRP by growing the organisms on iron-limited media; cellular disruption by sonication followed by centrifugal fractionation; selective solubilization of the MIRP with the cationic detergent hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide; cation-exchange chromatography in the presence of this detergent; and gel filtration chromatography. The MIRP purified by this technique migrates as a single band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purified MIRP displayed an unusually basic isoelectric point, this value being greater than 9.35. Further biochemical analysis revealed the highly conserved nature of this protein isolated from the two pathogenic species of the genus Neisseria. For example, the amino acid composition of the meningococcal and gonococcal MIRPs were nearly identical and amino terminal sequence analysis showed that both shared the identical primary sequence through residue 48. Surprisingly, the first five NH2-terminal residues of the MIRPs exhibited homology with the first five residues of the gonococcal porin, protein I. Purified preparations of the MIRP exhibited a characteristic pink color reminiscent of the basic iron-binding protein lactoferrin. This observation coupled with the property of iron-regulation prompted us to analyze purified MIRP for iron-content. Approximately 0.5 mol iron per 1 mol of MIRP was detected. This study is the first to show that iron is associated with the MIRP, a property that may implicate this protein as playing a direct role in neisserial iron assimilation. While the precise function of the MIRP is not known, the availability of this protein in pure and biologically relevant quantities will allow further studies to elucidate its pathobiologic function.
3 Genetic mapping of the ecotropic virus-inducing locus Akv-2 of the AKR mouse. A combination of somatic cell hybridization and standard mendelian breeding techniques was used to map the AKR ecotropic virus inducibility locus Akv-2 to the centromeric end of chromosome 16. This assignment of Akv-2 further emphasizes the endogenous ecotropic retroviruses are inserted at multiple sites in mouse chromosomes.
3 Inhibition of Ly-6A antigen expression prevents T cell activation. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the 5' end of the mRNA encoding the Ly-6A protein were used to block the expression of that protein. Using this approach we could inhibit the expression of Ly-6A by 60-80% in antigen-primed lymph node (LN) T cells as well as in the D10 T cell clone. Inhibition of Ly-6 expression resulted in the inability to restimulate in vitro, antigen-primed T cells. It also blocked the activation of normal spleen cells by Con A, monoclonal antibody (mAb) to CD3, and mAb to Ly-6. In contrast, stimulation of normal spleen cells with the pharmacological agents PMA + ionomycin were unaffected by the inhibition of Ly-6 expression. Similar results were obtained with the D10 T cell clone; stimulation with Con A + interleukin 1 (IL-1), antigen-presenting cells (APC), or the clonotypic antibody + IL-1 was greatly reduced in the presence of antisense oligonucleotides to Ly-6. Stimulation with PMA + ionomycin was again unaffected. We also studied the effect of antisense oligonucleotides on stimulation of preactivated D10 cells. Preactivation of D10 cells with Con A + IL-1 renders them receptive to secondary stimulation by other lymphokines. In this case, antisense oligonucleotides to Ly-6 had no effect on secondary activation with IL-2, IL-4 + IL-1, or PMA + ionomycin. We conclude from these studies that Ly-6 expression is required for T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated T cell activation.
3 Macrophage complement and lectin-like receptors bind Leishmania in the absence of serum. We have examined the relative roles of the macrophage (M phi) plasma membrane receptor for the cleaved third complement component (iC3b, CR3) and of the mannosyl/fucosyl receptor (MFR) in binding and ingestion of Leishmania donovani. In the absence of exogenous complement, the binding and ingestion of promastigotes, which are good activators of the alternative complement pathway, were inhibited by the anti-CR3 monoclonal antibody M1/70, by the Fab portion of an anti-C3 antibody, or by the nucleophile, sodium salicyl hydroxamate, an inhibitor of C3 fixation. This provides strong evidence that M phi-derived, cleaved C3 (iC3b) present on the promastigote surface mediates binding to CR3. Equivalent inhibition of promastigote binding and ingestion was also observed using the soluble inhibitors of MFR activity, mannan or ribonuclease B. No additive effect for blocking the two M phi receptors simultaneously was observed. For amastigotes, which are poor activators of the alternative pathway, a lesser but nevertheless equivalent effect was observed for the three soluble inhibitors of CR3-mediated binding vs. the two soluble inhibitors of MFR-mediated binding. Modulation experiments in which either CR3 or MFR had been rendered inaccessible demonstrated that both receptors must be present on the segment of M phi membrane to which the parasite binds. The combined function of these two distinct M phi receptors may provide a general mechanism for recognition and ingestion of other pathogenic protozoa known to activate the alternative pathway.
2 The life span of naive alpha/beta T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. We have determined the life span of naive CD4-8+ T cells in T cell receptor transgenic mice. We find that such cells do not divide in secondary lymphoid organs in both normal euthymic mice and T cell-deficient mice. By both continuous labeling and by chasing pulse-labeled cells, we find that the minimum life span of the naive T cells is in the order of 8 wk.
0 Identification of an idiotypic marker of a major regulatory T cell of the immune response in B10.BR mice to ferredoxin. The relationship of idiotypic regulation to conventional hapten-carrier effects. An anti-idiotypic antiserum was raised in rabbits to a monoclonal antibody (Fd-1) with specificity for one (the N epitope) of the two antigenic epitopes found on the ferredoxin (Fd) molecule. The anti-idiotypic antiserum (anti-Fd-1) was used to demonstrate that the Fd-1 idiotype was expressed at significant levels in most anti-Fd antisera raised in B10.BR mice. Examination of antisera raised in other mouse strains demonstrated that expression of this idiotype mapped to the IgH gene complex and was found in the antisera of all mouse strains examined with the Ig-1 allotype. When splenocytes from Fd-immune B10.Br mice were treated with anti-Fd-1 and transferred to irradiated syngeneic recipients, the adoptive secondary response was significantly higher in animals receiving treated cells as opposed to control animals, which received normal rabbit serum-treated cells. This response produced a net increase in antibody to both determinants, and the relative amount of Fd-1 idiotype was not significantly altered. Further studies with separated cell populations showed that the overall increase of anti-Fd antibody produced was attributable to the effects of the anti-idiotypic serum on a population(s) of T cells. Treatment of mice with the Fd-1 monoclonal antibody (which should react with anti-idiotypic cells) had an analogous effect to that of the anti-idiotype, in that mice so treated produced higher concentrations of anti-Fd antibodies when they were immunized and these antibodies exhibited net increases to both determinants. A model is presented to explain these results.
3 Molecular dissection of the murine antibody response to streptococcal group A carbohydrate. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to streptococcal group A carbohydrate (GAC) are encoded by a minimum of two VH, four JH, four V kappa, three J kappa, one V lambda, and one J lambda gene segments. The IdX, IdI-1, and Id5 idiotypic determinants are expressed by anti-GAC mAb and are found on free kappa chains. Each pattern of these determinants is encoded by a distinct V kappa gene segment, apparently without the requirement for a particular J kappa, VH, or JH gene segment, or somatic mutation. In contrast, the binding site-associated idiotypic determinant IdI-3a does not correlate with any single V or J gene segment.
1 Invariant chain is the core protein of the Ia-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. The murine Ia-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) was studied both biochemically and immunochemically to determine the nature of its core protein. Chondroitinase ABC or chondroitinase AC treatment of the CSPG digested the chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan, yielding a core protein that migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 38,000. Comparative V8 protease digestion of the CSPG core protein and conventional invariant glycoproteins yielded homologous peptides, indicating that the core protein and invariant chain were structurally similar. The purified CSPG and its core protein were both shown to react directly with the monoclonal anti-invariant chain antibody, In-1. Comparative tryptic peptide analysis by high performance liquid chromatography demonstrated coelution of the majority of the peptides from the invariant chain and the CSPG core protein. Collectively, these results indicate that the CSPG is an alternatively processed form of invariant chain.
3 Inducible cell adhesion molecule 110 (INCAM-110) is an endothelial receptor for lymphocytes. A CD11/CD18-independent adhesion mechanism. Inducible cell adhesion molecule 110 (INCAM-110) is a 110-kD glycoprotein expressed on cytokine-activated human vascular endothelial cells. mAb blocking studies indicate that INCAM-110 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) independently support the adhesion of lymphocytes to activated human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. Anti-CD11a/CD18 antibodies with anti-INCAM-110 mAb E1/6 produce greater inhibition of lymphocyte adhesion than either reagent alone, suggesting that INCAM-110 and LFA-1 are not an obligate receptor-ligand pair. Blood monocytes, but not polymorphonuclear leukocytes, also appear to bind endothelial INCAM-110. Endothelial expression of INCAM-110 is upregulated at sites of inflammation, suggesting a role in the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes.
0 The interleukin 2 receptor. Functional consequences of its bimolecular structure. High-affinity IL-2-R binding results from an exceptional type of cooperative interaction between two IL-2-binding proteins termed alpha and beta. When expressed together on the cell surface, these two distinct chains form a noncovalent kinetic hybrid receptor complex that exploits a rapid association rate contributed by the p55 beta chain and a slow dissociation rate characteristic for the p75 alpha chain. The p75 alpha chains signal cell growth, whereas the p55 beta chains only facilitate IL-2 binding by serving as helper binding sites, having no discernible signaling role themselves. The unique functional implications of this structural organization indicate that this cooperative bimolecular arrangement reflects a general mechanism by which the efficiency of surface receptors can be enhanced markedly.
3 Phenotypic variation in the response to the human immunodeficiency virus among derivatives of the CEM T and WIL-2 B cell lines. Derivatives of the CEM T and WIL-2 B cell lines showed striking diversity in their responses to the HTLV-IIIB strain of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Several stable phenotypic patterns could be defined, based on whether cells were permissive (P+, P-) for virus production, were sensitive or insensitive to cytopathic effects after infection by free virus (C+, C-), and whether they underwent fusion on contact with virus-infected cells (F+, F-). Although expression of CD4 was essential for infection by HTLV-IIIB, very low levels were sufficient for productive infection of WIL-2 derivatives. Conversely, some CEM T cell lines that expressed ample CD4, and which were able to bind virus gp120 and undergo fusion, did not support productive infection by free virus. One nonpermissive, CD4+ derivative of CEM could bind gp120 but failed to undergo fusion, suggesting an alteration in some membrane protein other than CD4 that is essential for virus entry and HIV-induced cell fusion. The AA2 derivative of the WIL-2 cell line is also described, which is remarkably permissive for HIV replication and exquisitely sensitive to virus cytopathic effect. The panel of related cell lines with different host-virus phenotypes could be useful for more precisely defining steps in the infectious cycle of HIV, and for identifying host cell genes and gene products that determine the outcome of HIV infection.
3 MAP1B is required for axon guidance and Is involved in the development of the central and peripheral nervous system. Microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP1B have long been suspected to play an important role in neuronal differentiation, but proof has been lacking. Previous MAP1B gene targeting studies yielded contradictory and inconclusive results and did not reveal MAP1B function. In contrast to two earlier efforts, we now describe generation of a complete MAP1B null allele. Mice heterozygous for this MAP1B deletion were not affected. Homozygous mutants were viable but displayed a striking developmental defect in the brain, the selective absence of the corpus callosum, and the concomitant formation of myelinated fiber bundles consisting of misguided cortical axons. In addition, peripheral nerves of MAP1B-deficient mice had a reduced number of large myelinated axons. The myelin sheaths of the remaining axons were of reduced thickness, resulting in a decrease of nerve conduction velocity in the adult sciatic nerve. On the other hand, the anticipated involvement of MAP1B in retinal development and gamma-aminobutyric acid C receptor clustering was not substantiated. Our results demonstrate an essential role of MAP1B in development and function of the nervous system and resolve a previous controversy over its importance.
0 Expression and function of a nonglycosylated major histocompatibility class I antigen. The major histocompatibility class I antigens, expressed in most somatic cells, have carbohydrate moieties. We constructed mutant mouse MHC class I genes in which codons for the N-linked glycosylation sites were replaced by those of other amino acids. L cell transformants expressing the nonglycosylated class I antigens allowed us to investigate biological roles of carbohydrates with the highest specificity possible. The nonglycosylated antigen was unchanged in its overall serological specificities, and was recognized by alloreactive cytotoxic T cells. Further, the antigen was capable of mediating cytotoxic activity of vesicular stomatitis virus-specific T cells. These studies indicate that carbohydrates are not essential for immunological function of the MHC class I antigens. Cell surface expression of the nonglycosylated antigen was markedly reduced as compared with the native antigen, which was not attributable to accelerated degradation or rapid shedding. We conclude that the primary role of carbohydrates of the class I antigens is to facilitate the intracellular transport of the nascent proteins to the plasma membrane. The possible involvement of carbohydrate-receptor interactions in this process is discussed.
3 Elevated serum levels in human pregnancy of a molecule immunochemically similar to eosinophil granule major basic protein. We have shown that serum levels of a molecule immunochemically similar to eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP) are elevated in pregnant women throughout gestation. MBP levels increase during gestation and plateau at approximately 7,500 ng/ml by the 20th wk (greater than 10-fold above normal). Levels return to normal after delivery, with a T1/2 of 13.7 d. The MBP in pregnancy serum is remarkably similar to the eosinophil granule MBP in that: (a) pregnancy MBP fully inhibits the binding of radiolabeled MBP standard in a double antibody radioimmunoassay; (b) this inhibition reaction is specific for human MBP because pregnancy serum produces no inhibition of the binding of radiolabeled guinea pig MBP in the guinea pig MBP radioimmunoassay; (c) in a two-site immunoradiometric assay for MBP, slopes of dose-response curves for pregnancy serum, purified MBP, and serum from a patient with hypereosinophilic syndrome are identical, and maximal binding is comparable; (d) reduction and alkylation of pregnancy sera increases measured MBP 100-fold, as previously shown for eosinophil granule MBP in serum; and (e) the MBP in pregnancy serum demonstrates the same pattern of heat lability as has been previously reported for MBP. Four observations have raised the possibility that the eosinophil is not the source of the MBP in pregnancy serum: (a) no correlation between serum MBP level and peripheral blood eosinophil count exists in pregnant women, in contrast to previous studies of patients with eosinophilia; (b) levels of three other eosinophil-associated proteins are normal or low in pregnancy sera, whereas the serum levels of these proteins are elevated in patients with eosinophilia; (c) the slopes of dose-response curves for pregnancy sera and MBP standards differ in the double antibody radioimmunoassay; and (d) the molecule in pregnancy serum elutes from Sephadex G-50 columns at the void volume, while eosinophil granule MBP and the MBP in serum of patients with eosinophilia elute at a volume consistent with the previously established molecular weight of 9,300. These findings suggest that the MBP in pregnancy serum is derived from a source other than the eosinophil.
0 Diversity in the germline antibody repertoire. Molecular evolution of the T15 VN gene family. The T15 heavy chain variable region (VH) gene family in BALB/c mice includes four elements each greater than 88% homologous with the other. One of these elements, V1, encodes virtually all of the VH regions in BALB/c antiphosphorylcholine antibodies, while another element, V3, is a pseudogene and cannot be transcribed or translated. We have examined the structural features of this VH gene family in other mouse strains and, in particular, have cloned and sequenced the alleles of these gene segments present in B10.P mice. Each of the four B10.P sequences can be matched with its allelic counterpart in BALB/c mice. This represents the first successful analysis of allelism in antibody variable region gene segments. The V1B10.P allele, like its BALB/c counterpart, encodes most of the known phosphorylcholine binding heavy chains from C37BL/6 mice. Similarly, the V3B10.P gene segment is a pseudogene like V3BALB, although only two of four abnormalities present in the BALB/c allele are also present in the B10.P allele. Careful analysis of the specific substitutions observed in the T15 VH gene family suggests that environmental selection for functional combining regions contributes significantly to the pattern of variation in the germline antibody repertoire. In addition, evidence is presented supporting frequent gene conversion events in the divergence of antibody genes.
0 Defective lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow of motheaten (me/me) and viable motheaten (mev/mev) mutant mice. III. Normal mouse bone marrow cells enable mev/mev prothymocytes to generate thymocytes after intravenous transfer. Bone marrow prothymocytes from me/me and mev/mev mutant mice fail to generate thymocytes in irradiated (600 rad) +/+ wild-type recipients after intravenous injection. However, these same prothymocytes readily generate thymocytes after intrathymic injection. The results of the present study demonstrate that this apparent defect in the thymus-homing capacity of mev/mev prothymocytes can be corrected by mixing irradiated wild-type bone marrow cells with mev/mev bone marrow cells before intravenous injection. However, this defect is not corrected by passage of mev/mev bone marrow cells through the bone marrow of irradiated wild-type recipients. One interpretation of these results is that the maturation of prothymocytes is reversibly arrested in mev/mev mice by a defect in the radiosensitive compartment of the bone marrow microenvironment.
3 Superantigen-reactive CD4+ T cells are required to stimulate B cells after infection with mouse mammary tumor virus. Superantigens are defined by their ability to stimulate a large fraction of T cells via interaction with the T cell receptor (TCR) V beta domain. Endogenous superantigens, classically termed minor lymphocyte-stimulating (Mls) antigens, were recently identified as products of open reading frames (ORF) in integrated proviral copies of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). We have described an infectious MMTV homologue of the classical endogenous superantigen Mls-1a (Mtv-7). The ORF molecules of both the endogenous Mtv-7 and the infectious MMTV(SW) interact with T cells expressing the TCR V beta 6, 7, 8.1, and 9 domains. Furthermore, the COOH termini of their ORF molecules, thought to confer TCR specificity, are very similar. Since successful transport of MMTV from the site of infection in the gut to the mammary gland depends on a functional immune system, we were interested in determining the early events after and requirements for MMTV infection. We show that MMTV(SW) infection induces a massive response of V beta 6+ CDC4+ T cells, which interact with the viral ORF. Concomitantly, we observed a B cell response and differentiation that depends on both the presence and stimulation of the superantigen-reactive T cells. Furthermore, we show that B cells are the main target of the initial MMTV infection as judged by the presence of the reverse-transcribed viral genome and ORF transcripts. Thus, we suggest that MMTV infection of B cells leads to ORF-mediated B-T cell interaction, which maintains and possibly amplifies viral infection.
3 Induction of alloantigen-specific hyporesponsiveness in human T lymphocytes by blocking interaction of CD28 with its natural ligand B7/BB1. The specificity of T lymphocyte activation is determined by engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) by peptide/major histocompatibility complexes expressed on the antigen-presenting cell (APC). Lacking costimulation by accessory molecules on the APC, T cell proliferation does not occur and unresponsiveness to subsequent antigenic stimulus is induced. The B7/BB1 receptor on APCs binds CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells, and provides a costimulus for T cell proliferation. Here, we show that prolonged, specific T cell hyporesponsiveness to antigenic restimulation is achieved by blocking the interaction between CD28 and B7/BB1 in human mixed leukocyte culture (MLC). Secondary T cell proliferative responses to specific alloantigen were inhibited by addition to the primary culture of monovalent Fab fragments of anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9.3, which block interaction of CD28 with B7/BB1 without activating T cells. Hypo-responsiveness was also induced in MLC by CTLA4Ig, a chimeric immunoglobulin fusion protein incorporating the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 with high binding avidity for B7/BB1. Cells previously primed could also be made hyporesponsive, if exposed to alloantigen in the presence of CTLA4Ig. Maximal hyporesponsiveness was achieved in MLC after 2 d of incubation with CTLA4Ig, and was maintained for at least 27 d after removal of CTLA4Ig. Accumulation of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon gamma but not IL-4 mRNA was blocked by CTLA4Ig in T cells stimulated by alloantigen. Antigen-specific responses could be restored by addition of exogenous IL-2 at the time of the secondary stimulation. Addition to primary cultures of the intact bivalent anti-CD28 mAb 9.3, or B7/BB1+ transfected CHO cells or exogenous IL-2, abrogated induction of hyporesponsiveness by CTLA4Ig. These data indicate that interaction of CD28 with B7/BB1 during TCR engagement with antigen is required to maintain T cell competence and that blocking such interaction can result in a state of T cell hyporesponsiveness.
3 Transient adhesion of neutrophils to endothelium. Fluorescently labeled polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were used to measure adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) cultured in vitro. Stimulation of PMN with phorbol dibutyrate (PDB), TNF, or C5a caused an increase in adhesion followed by a return to prestimulation levels of adhesion of longer times of incubation. Maximal adhesion of PMN to EC occurred rapidly in response to C5a (5 min) and more slowly with TNF or PDB (15 min). PMN stimulated to adhere with C5a detached from EC by 15 min. PMN from CD11/CD18-deficient patients and PMN incubated with anti-CD18 mAbs failed to bind to EC despite maximal stimulation. Anti-CD11a/CD18 and anti-CD11b/CD18 each partially inhibited adhesion, and a combination of these two reagents completely blocked adhesion. The adhesion we measured was therefore completely dependent on CD11/CD18, and CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18 each contributed to adhesion. Stimuli that enhanced adhesion of PMN to EC also enhanced expression of CD11b/CD18 on the cell surface, but the time course of expression correlated poorly with changes in adhesivity. To determine if changes in the expression of CD11b/CD18 are necessary for the changes in adhesivity, we used enucleate cytoplasts that did not increase expression of CD11b/CD18. Cytoplasts showed a normal rise and fall in adhesivity in response to PDB. We conclude that the transient adhesion of stimulated PMN to naive EC is regulated by changes in the nature of existing CD11/CD18 molecules on the PMN surface. Changes in expression of CD11b/CD18 may contribute to enhancement of adhesivity, but a definite role for this phenomenon has yet to be established.
2 Ultimate erythropoietic repopulating abilities of fetal, young adult, and old adult cells compared using repeated irradiation. Erythropoietic repopulating abilities of fetal liver cells and young and old adult marrow cells were compared as follows: Equal numbers of cells from a donor of each age were mixed with a constant portion of cells pooled from genetically distinguishable competitors. These mixtures were transplanted into stem cell-depleted recipients, and the proportions of recipient hemoglobin that were donor type measured the relative effectiveness of early erythropoietic precursor cells from the various donors (Fig. 1). At intervals of 3-6 mo, recipients were sublethally irradiated, requiring a new round of competitive repopulation. When B6 mice were used as donors, with WBB6F1 competitors and recipients, the highest levels of stem cell activity were found using old donors (Tables I, III). This was true even with unirradiated, immune-competent W/Wv recipients (Table III). When donors and recipients were WBB6F1 hybrids, with B6 competitors, fetal cells initially gave higher levels of repopulating ability, and they were similar to the adult and old marrow cells after 400 d and after recovery from two sublethal irradiations (Table II). These effects were mostly insignificant and probably reflect small differences in initial stem cell concentrations that are brought out by the sensitivity of the competitive repopulation assay. Clearly, ultimate erythropoietic stem cell proliferative capacities did not decline as a result of the proliferation required between 15 d of fetal life and old age. Repopulating abilities of 12-d fetal liver cells were not detectable. We also showed that the proportions of newly synthesized hemoglobins made by the two types of stem cells in tetraparental mice remained nearly constant when tested at 3-d intervals over 30 d. Minimum numbers of stem cells producing erythrocytes over a single 3-d period were calculated as 62 and 128, but these are too low, since variances were similar in the tetraparental mice and in the F1 hybrid control. This contradicts the hypothesis that erythropoietic stem cells reserve limited proliferative capacities by proliferating one or a few at a time. We suggest that erythropoietic stem cells have essentially unlimited proliferative capacities and are found in approximately equal concentrations in the primary erythropoietic organs after 15 or 16 d of fetal life.
0 Identification of a restriction fragment length polymorphism by a CR1 cDNA that correlates with the number of CR1 on erythrocytes. A genetic basis for the regulation of the number of CR1 on E of different normal individuals was investigated by probing Southern blots of their genomic DNA with a 0.75-kb fragment of CR1 cDNA. Using Hind III, we observed a RFLP involving fragments of 7.4 kb and 6.9 kb that correlated with the number of CR1 on E. 32 individuals having only the 7.4-kb restriction fragment had a mean of 661 +/- 33 (SEM) CR1/E, 11 donors having both restriction fragments had a mean of 455 +/- 52 CR1/E, and 7 individuals having only the 6.9-kb fragment had a mean of 156 +/- 13 CR1/E, all means being significantly different (p less than 0.005). Cosegregation in a normal family of the Hind III restriction fragments with the S, F, and F' structural allotypes of CR1 confirmed that the regulatory element identified by these fragments is linked to the CR1 gene. Moreover, an analysis of the relative expression on E of these structural allotypes in association with either the 7.4-kb Hind III fragment or the 6.9-kb fragment showed that this regulatory element is cis-acting. In contrast, quantitation of CR1 of B lymphocytes and neutrophils revealed no differences in total CR1 expression between individuals homozygous for the 7.4-kb and 6.9-kb Hind III fragments. Thus, we have identified a genomic polymorphism that is linked to the CR1 gene and is associated with a cis-acting regulatory element for the expression of CR1 on E.
1 Purification of macrophage deactivating factor. Macrophage deactivation factor (MDF) in P815 tumor cell-conditioned medium was assayed by its suppression of the ability of activated mouse peritoneal macrophages to release hydrogen peroxide. MDF displayed properties of a soluble protein(s) associated with both low (8-25,000) and high (greater than 450,000) Mr fractions. MDF was purified 6,140-fold by a seven-step procedure: extraction with acid-ethanol; precipitation with ether; and fractionation on gel filtration, anion-exchange, diphenyl reversed-phase and C4 reversed-phase HPLC columns, the last column twice. The final preparation contained two species: (a) a approximately 13,000 Mr band on reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE and on autoradiograms after radioiodination with chloramine T, and (b) a 66,000 Mr species ranging from approximately 5% to approximately 50% of the protein detectable by silver strain. The 66,000 Mr species was identified as albumin from its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. However, no amino acid sequence could be obtained for the approximately 13,000 Mr species, either in fluid phase or after electroelution of the corresponding SDS-PAGE band. Thus, approximately 13,000 Mr MDF associates tightly with albumin through a variety of separation techniques, and may have a blocked NH2 terminus. Purified MDF afforded 50% inhibition of activated macrophage H2O2 releasing capacity at a concentration of 1-10 nM. Separation of MDF from most higher Mr moieties was associated with disproportionately small increases in specific activity, suggesting MDF might be partially inactivated by purification. As purified, MDF was approximately 1,000-fold less potent at deactivating macrophages than TGF-beta. Antibodies that neutralized the macrophage-deactivating effect of TGF-beta did not inhibit deactivation by MDF.
3 Alternative pathway of complement: recruitment of precursor properdin by the labile C3/C5 convertase and the potentiation of the pathway. In this study the physiological role of properdin and the differential subunit composition of the solid phase enzymes of the pathway have been explored. Cell-bound C3 and C5 convertase differ in their C3b requirement. Apparently one molecule of C3b is sufficient to allow formation of C3 convertase (C3b,B), whereas two or more are required for generation of C5 convertase (C3bn,B). This conclusion was drawn from results indicating the critical role of the spacial distribution of C3b molecules on the cell surface in enzyme formation. While the C3/C5 convertase is fully capable of acting on C5 and thereby initiating the assembly of the cytolytic membrane attack complex, it is exceedingly labile and vulnerable to destruction by the C3b inactivator. It is the apparent role of properdin to confer a degree of stability upon the labile enzyme and to protect its C3 convertase function against enzymatic destruction. To achieve these effects, precursor properdin (pre-P) is recruited in a binding-activation reaction by the labile C3/C5 convertase. Multiple C3b molecules appear to be needed for the formation of properdin-activating principle. Three modes of regulation have been described, which involve spontaneous dissociation enzymatic degradation by C3b inactivator and disassembly by beta1H. The functional differences of pre-P and activated properdin (P) were delineated, pre-P displaying a weak affinity for C3b and P the capacity of strong interaction, P generating a soluble C3 convertase in serum and pre-P being unable to do so. Because of the profound differences between native pre-P and the laboratory product P, the question was raised as to whether soluble P represents an unphysiological form of the protein. On the basis of this and other studies, the conclusion was reached that in vitro properdin recruitment constitutes the terminal event of the properdin pathway, and that properdin augments the function of C3/C5 convertase without changing its substrate specificity.
1 Fractionation of human T lymphocytes on wheat germ agglutinin-sepharose. T cells from human peripheral blood was purified by fractionation on columns charged with human immunoglobulin and rabbit anti-human immuno-globulin. When assayed with 125I- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA), a weakly binding and a strongly binding subpopulation could be distinguished. These T-cell subpopulations were fractionated on columns charged with WGA, convalently bound to Sepharose 6MB. The cells responding to the mitogens leukoagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris and concanavalin A were enriched in the strongly binding subpopulation (approximately 20% of the T cells) while they were depleted from the weakly binding subpopulation.
3 Site of binding of mouse IgG2b to the Fc receptor on mouse macrophages. Three mouse immunoglobulins with altered heavy chains have been used to study the specificity of the mouse IgG2b Fc receptor on mouse macrophages. These immunoglobulins were synthesized by variant clones derived from the MPC 11, IgG2b-producing mouse myeloma cell line. One variant, whose Fc receptor. A second variant, which makes a short heavy chain lacking the CH3 domain, binds specifically to the IgG2b Fc receptor. The third variant makes a hybrid IgG2b-IgG2a heavy chain whose CH3 domain is enterely IgG2a-like and binds to both IgG2a and IgG2b Fc receptors. These data suggest that the binding of mouse IgG2b immunoglobulins to the mouse macrophage Fc receptor involves a site within the CH2 domain and indicate that immunoglobulins with altered heavy chains are a useful tool to probe Fc receptors.
3 Frequency and avidity of specific antigen-binding cells in developing mice. In order to analyze the development of antibody diversity in which the genes coding for the antigen-specific cells we have compared the binding of diverse antigens by cells in the fetal, neonatal, and adult mouse. Although the numbers of antigen-binding cells present in fetuses and young animals were smaller than in adults, no restriction could be detected in the varity of specificities expressed in the fetuses, either with respect to the kinds of antigens bound, or to the range of avidities of binding. Cells specific for each of the 11 antigens tested could be detected in the fetus only in the last 4 days before birth, at which time they appeared both in the liver and in the spleen. In all cases, these cells disappeared both in the liver and in the spleen. In all cases, these cells disappeared from the liver within a day of birth, but continued to increase in number in the spleen until adulthood...
3 Adaptive differentiation of murine lymphocytes. IV (Responder x nonresponder) F1 T cells can be taught to preferentially help nonresponder, rather than responder, B cells. Responses to the synthetic terpolymer L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, L-tyrosine (GLT) in the mouse are controlled by H-2-1inked Ir-GLTgenes. (Responder x nonresponder) F(1) hybrid mice, themselves phenotypic responders, can be primed with GLT to develop specific helper cells capable of interacting with 2,4-dinitrophenyl hapten (DNP)-primed F(1) B cells in response to DNP-GLT. Unlike the indiscriminant ability of F(1) helper T cells for conventional antigens (i.e. not Ir gene-controlled), which can help B cells of either parental type (as well as F(1)) equally well, GLT-primed F(1) T cells can only provide help under normal circumstances for B lymphocytes of responder parent origin; they are unable to communicate effectively with nonresponder parental B cells (1, and the present studies). The present studies reveal, however, that the induction of a parental cell-induced allogeneic effect during priming of F(1) mice to GLT actually dictates the direction of cooperating preference that will be displayed by such F(1) helper cells for B cells of one parental type or the other. Thus, F(1) T cells, primed to GLT under the influence of an allogeneic effect induced by parental BALB/c cells, develop into effective helpers for nonresponder A/J B cells, but fail to develop effective helpers for responder BALB/c B cells, and vice-versa. In contrast, F(1) T cells, primed to GLT under the influence of an allogeneic effect induced by either parental type, display significantly enhanced levels of helper activity for B cells derived from F(1) donors. These results are interpreted to reflect the existence of two interdependent events provoked by the allogeneic effect: one event augments the differentiation of GLT-specific helper T cells belonging to the subset corresponding to the opposite parental type; this would explain the development of increased helper activity provided to partner B cells of opposite parental type (as well as of F(1) origin). The second event, we postulate, involves the production of responses against the receptors which normally self-recognize native cell interaction determinants; this form of anti-idiotype response is restricted against self- recognizing receptors of the same parental type used for induction of the allogeneic effect, hence explaining diminished helper activity of such F(1) cells for partner B lymphocytes of corresponding parental type.
3 Enhancement of human eosinophil-mediated killing of Schistosoma mansoni larvae by mononuclear cell products in vitro. Previous studies have shown that eosinophils from eosinophilic individuals differ functionally from those of normal individuals. In order to test whether agents that might induce eosinophilia could also affect eosinophil function, we have compared the capacity of culture supernatants from mononuclear cells of eosinophilic or normal individuals to enhance eosinophil activity, as reflected by an increased killing of schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni in vitro. An enhancing activity was detected, which increased both the antibody-dependent, and to some extent the antibody-independent killing of schistosomula by eosinophils, in the absence of complement. Under similar conditions, the supernatants failed to stimulate an otherwise undetectable neutrophil-mediated killing. The activity could be removed from the assay by washing, without reversing previous eosinophil stimulation, and was not directly toxic to the schistosomula. Preliminary characterization of the activity indicated that it was relatively heat-stable at 100 degrees C for 30 min, and had an estimated molecular weight of 35,000-45,000 as judged by G-200 Sephadex fractionation. The activity was produced by a nonlymphocytic, nonspecific esterase-containing adherent mononuclear cell in the absence of either Con A or antigenic stimulation. Significant enhancing activity was detectable after 1 h of culture and continued for at least 25 h. Protein synthesis was required for its production or release. Although the activity was detectable in supernatants from both eosinophilic and normal individuals, the supernatants that demonstrated highest activity and that could be titrated out furthest were generally derived from eosinophilic individuals, suggesting that there might be some association between eosinophilia and enhanced eosinophil function.
3 Metabolism of formycin B by Leishmania amastigotes in vitro. Comparative metabolism in infected and uninfected human macrophages. Formycin B is metabolized by cutaneous Leishmania amastigotes within cultured human macrophages to give formycin B 5'-monophosphate and formycin A 5'-mono-, di-, and triphosphates. Formycin A is also incorporated into RNA. The activity of formycin B against amastigotes was correlated with the levels of formycin A metabolites formed in the parasites. Uninfected macrophages also convert formycin B into the same products, but the levels are markedly lower than those seen in infected macrophages. The results suggest that a sufficient therapeutic index exists to warrant consideration of formycin B as an anti-leishmanial drug in humans.
0 Mechanisms of autoantibody production in autoimmune MRL mice. The quantitative expression of anti-DNA and anti-Sm antibodies has been investigated in autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr and MRL-+/+ mice. Anti-Sm antibodies were detected in sera from 21/23 lpr/lpr and 10/16 +/+ mice, with individual animals showing striking variation in the time-course and magnitude of this autoantibody response. The peak antibody levels of the responding animals of each substrain did not differ significantly. For anti-DNA antibody, a different pattern of responsiveness was observed. Individual animals of each substrain produced very similar responses in terms of the magnitude and time-course of serum anti-DNA antibody. The differences in the peak levels of the two substrains were highly significant, with lpr/lpr mice demonstrating a much greater anti-DNA antibody response than +/+ mice. In lpr/lpr mice tested for both autoantibody systems, serum anti-DNA and anti-Sm antibodies showed distinct time-courses. These studies indicate that anti-DNA and anti-Sm antibodies are expressed independently in MRL mice, with the expression of anti-DNA, but not anti-Sm antibody markedly influenced by the presence of the 1pr gene. A fundamental difference in the mechanisms involved in the generation of anti-DNA and anti-Sm antibodies is suggested by the quantitative pattern of the two responses.
3 Functional characteristics of Peyer's patch cells. III. Carrier priming of T cells by antigen feeding. Peyer's patch T cells may serve an important role in the interaction of the host with intraluminal gut antigens. Studies presented in this paper demonstrate that T cells in murine Peyer's patches can be carrier primed for helper function in the induction of an antihapten response by feeding antigen. Carrier priming was assessed by measuring the ability of Peyer's patch cells from mice fed heterologous erythrocytes to enhance an antitrinitrophenyl (TNP) response in vitro when added to normal Peyer's patch cells cultured with TNP coupled to the erythrocyte used for feeding. Priming of T helper cells in Peyer's patches was antigen specific and occurred when erythrocytes were administered orally but not when erythrocytes were injected intravenously or intraperitoneally. Murine Peyer's patches are naturally deficient in a cooperating accessory adherent cell type(s) required for B-cell induction to humoral antibody synthesis in vitro and antigen feeding does not result in significant induction of Peyer's patch B cells to humoral antibody synthesis in vivo. Since Peyer's patch T cells can be carrier-antigen primed for helper function in the absence of B-cell induction to humoral antibody synthesis, these studies may indicate that T-cell priming is less dependent than B-cell induction on cooperating accessory adherent cells.
3 Characterization of the tissue macrophage and the interstitial dendritic cell as distinct leukocytes normally resident in the connective tissue of rat heart. Immunohistological studies with a mouse anti-rat macrophage mAb (BMAC-5) demonstrated the presence of numerous positive cells in the interstitial connective tissues of many organs. The pattern resembled that seen with anti-MHC class II antibodies, with the striking exception that BMAC-5+ cells were rare or absent in the portal triad, the islets of Langerhans, and the kidney. Double-labeling fluorescence studies were therefore performed in rat heart using the BMAC-5 mAb in combination with rabbit antisera to pure rat class II MHC antigens and pure rat leukocyte common (CD45) antigens. The tissue macrophages in heart were identified as BMAC-5+, MHC class II-negative, leukocyte common antigen-positive cells. They could be distinguished from the BMAC-5-, MHC class II-positive, leukocyte common antigen-positive interstitial dendritic cells. Moreover, 7 d after lethal irradiation, the class II-positive interstitial dendritic cells had completely disappeared from heart, whereas the BMAC-5+ macrophages were present in undiminished numbers. These studies strongly suggest that the interstitial dendritic cell and the tissue macrophage represent two distinct populations of leukocytes within the connective tissues of antigenically secluded organs such as the heart. They have potentially important implications for the physiology of the immune system, as well as for autoimmunity and transplantation.
2 Inheritance of antibody specificity. III. A new VH gene controls fine specificity of anti-p-azobenzenearsonate coupled to the carbon atom 5 of hydroxyphenylacetic acid in the mouse. Mice of 10 inbred strains were immunized with a protein conjugate of a hapten of p-azobenzenearsonate coupled to the carbon atom 5 of hydroxphenylacetic acid (ABA-HOP), and anti-ABA-HOP titers were determined by the haptenated phage inactivation. Mean titers of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were significantly lower than those of A/J and CBA strains. The titers were under a polygenic control and did not correlate with allotypes in backcross mice. Fine specificity of the anti-ABA-HOP was characterized by inhibiting the haptenated phage inactivation reaction with five chemically related compounds including ABA-HOP (Fig. 1). This antibody was genetically more polymorphic than any other antibody studied. Three distinct idiotypes could be demonstrated and the number is probably greater. The idiotypes of the A/J and C57BL/6 were inherited as allotype-linked dominant Mendelian traits, the former in two and the latter in three different backcrosses. Condominance of the two alleles was shown since approximately equal amounts of the two idiotypes were produced by the population of heterozygous mice. There were many individual heterozygotes, however, in which only one parental idiotype could be detected. In other individuals of the same genotype the other parental idiotype was predominant. In many mice a mixture of the two idiotypes was indicated by doubly sigmoid inhibition curves. The causes for the variation in the expression of the two alleles in genotypically identical mice is discussed.
3 Serological and immunochemical analysis of the products of a single HLA DR-alpha and DR-beta chain gene expressed in a mouse cell line after DNA-mediated cotransformation reveals that the beta chain carries a known supertypic specificity. Using a mouse cell line transformed with and expressing a single HLA DR-alpha and DR-beta chain gene, we present evidence that the product of the DR-beta chain gene carries a supertypic determinant, BR3, previously defined by serology. The amino acid sequence of this beta chain gene is determined from the DNA sequence. Another DR-associated supertypic specificity defined by monoclonal antibody MCS7 was not encoded by this DR-beta chain gene. This provides formal proof that a supertypic specificity can be associated with a product of a distinct DR-beta locus. We propose that haplotypes sharing such specificities are evolutionarily related.
3 CD4+ T cells are required for development of a murine retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS). Mice depleted in vivo of CD4+ Th cells by treatment with mAb GK1.5 were found to be resistant to the lymphoproliferative/immunodeficiency disease (MAIDS) induced in intact mice by infection with the mixture of LP-BM5 murine leukemia viruses. Depleted mice did not develop lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, had normal serum IgM levels, normal CTL responses to alloantigens, and were able to generate PFC responses to Th-independent antigens even though frequencies of virus-producing spleen cells were comparable in depleted and intact mice. Depletion of CD4+ Th cells after infection resulted in a reversal of many abnormalities exhibited by infected controls; spleen weights, serum IgM levels, and allogeneic CTL responses of treated mice were comparable to those of uninfected controls. These results demonstrate that dysfunction of CD4+ Th cells is central to the induction and progression of both T and B cell abnormalities in MAIDS.
3 The TL region gene 37 encodes a Qa-1 antigen. Of all the biochemically defined mouse MHC class I molecules, the Qa-1 antigens are the only ones for which a gene has not been identified. Recent evidence has suggested that Qa-1 antigens are functional class I molecules and can function as restriction elements for gamma/delta T cells. We have examined the relationship between Qa-1 and the product of gene 37, a presumed novel class I antigen encoded within the TL region. Immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the molecules reactive with anti-Qa-1 and anti-37 sera show that the Qa-1 molecule of Qa-1b (Qa-1.2) mouse strains is identical to the product of gene 37 on the basis of molecular weight, pI, and strain distribution. Immunodepletion, biosynthetic labeling, and tunicamycin treatment confirm that the protein encoded by gene 37 in Qa-1b mice is Qa-1.2. In contrast, the anti-37 serum was unable to recognize the Qa-1 molecule in Qa-1a strains. Given the fact that the only allele to gene 37 thus far identified in a Qa-1a strain (A/J) has a termination codon in the alpha 3 domain, our data lead us to conclude that the Qa-1 molecule expressed in Qa-1a mice is not a true allelic product of the gene 37 encoded antigen of Qa-1b mouse strains.
3 The major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen receptor on T cells. II. Role of the L3T4 product. We have examined the role of the murine homologue of Leu-3 T4, L3T4, in recognition of antigen in association with products of the major histocompatibility complex (Ag/MHC) by murine T cell hybridomas. A series of ovalbumin (OVA)/I-Ad-specific T cell hybridomas were ranked in their sensitivity to Ag/I by measuring their ability to respond to low doses of OVA, or their sensitivity to inhibition by anti-I-Ad antibodies. T cell hybridomas with low apparent avidity for OVA/I-Ad, i.e. that did not respond well to low concentrations of OVA and were easily inhibited by anti-I-Ad, were also easily inhibited by anti-L3T4 antibodies. The reverse was true for T cell hybridomas with apparent high avidity for Ag/MHC. We found that the presence of low doses of anti-L3T4 antibodies caused T cell hybridomas to respond less well to low doses of Ag, and to be more easily inhibited by anti-I-Ad antibodies. These results suggested that the role of the L3T4 molecule is to increase the overall avidity of the reaction between T cells and Ag-presenting cells. In support of this idea was the discovery of several L3T4- subclones of one of our L3T4+ T cell hybridomas, D0.11.10. The L3T4- subclones had the same amount of receptor for OVA/I-Ad as their L3T4+ parent, as detected by an anti-receptor monoclonal antibody. The L3T4- subclones, however, responded less well to low doses of OVA, and were more easily inhibited by anti-I-Ad antibodies than their L3T4/ parent. These results showed that the L3T4 molecule was not required for surface expression of, or functional activity of, the T cell receptor for Ag/MHC. The L3T4 molecule did, however, increase the sensitivity with which the T cell reacted with Ag/MHC on Ag-presenting cells.
3 Effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha on mitogen-activated human B cells. In this study we demonstrate that the monocyte/macrophage product, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), has significant in vitro effects of B cell function. It costimulated with anti-mu in the induction of B cell DNA synthesis, and it prolonged the DNA synthesis initiated in B cell cultures stimulated with the human B cell mitogen, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC). The addition of either IL-1 or IFN-gamma to TNF-alpha resulted in a substantial further increase in DNA synthesis. The addition of TNF-alpha to IL-2, a known inducer of SAC-activated B cell Ig secretion, resulted in a twofold enhancement in the amount of IL-2 stimulated B cell Ig secretion. Receptor binding studies with 125I-TNF-alpha demonstrate a marked increase in TNF-alpha binding sites after B cell activation (approximately 6,000 sites per cell, with an apparent Kd of 2.0 X 10(-10) M). Thus, TNF-alpha may be an important factor in human B cell function and is likely to interact with other T cell and monocyte derived cytokines in the regulation of human B cell proliferation and Ig production.
3 In vitro model for natural tolerance to self-antigens. Inhibition of the development of surface-immunoglobulin-negative lymphocytes into T-dependent responsive B cells by antigen. Neonatal and adult splenic cell suspensions were labeled with fluorescein isothiocynate-anti-Ig and fractionated into surface-immunoglobulin- (s-Ig) positive and s-Ig-negative subpopulations by the fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The subpopulations were then tested by splenic focus assay for both frequency and tolerance susceptibility of clonable 2,4,-dinitrophenol (DNP) precursors. It was shown that both adult, and neonatal, s-Ig-negative subsets contained clonable DNP-specific B-cell precursors. However, because these precursors result in fewer clones secreting IgG, they appeared to be less mature than the s-Ig-positive precursors. In the absence of helper T cells, it was found that exposure of s-Ig-negative lymphocytes to tolerogen during the process in which they were acquiring surface receptors resulted in nearly total abrogation of potential DNP clones. This finding provides compelling evidence for clonal abortion.
3 Distribution of common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen in nonhematopoietic tissues. The common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA), as defined by J-5 murine monoclonal antibodies, was detected on renal tubular and glomerular cells from fetal and adult donors by an indirect immunoperoxidase technique. CALLA could also be detected on epithelial cells of the fetal small intestine and on myoepithelial cells of adult breast but not on myoepithelial cells of the salivary gland. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of immunoprecipitated 125I-labeled membrane antigens from dissociated renal cells demonstrated that the antigen migrated as a 90,000 mol wt antigen rather than the 98,000-100,000 mol wt antigen noted on CALLA-positive tissue culture cell lines. The data suggest that the determinant defined by the J-5 monoclonal antibody is neither a lymphoid cell-specific differentiation antigen nor a leukemia-specific antigen.
1 A subset of natural killer cells in peripheral blood displays a mature T cell phenotype. Normal human PBMC were analyzed for the presence of cells expressing both T3 and NKH1 antigens, using direct two-color immunofluorescence. In six individuals, NKH1+T3+ cells were found to represent 2.5% of PBMC and 24% of the total number of NKH1+ cells. Purified NKH1+T3+ cells were shown to have the typical morphology of large granular lymphocytes (LGL). NKH1+T3+ cells also exhibited spontaneous cytotoxicity against K562 target cells and this lytic activity could be inhibited by anti-T3 mAb. Similar results were obtained with NKH1+T3+ cells cultured in vitro in lymphocyte-conditioned medium. Taken together, these results indicate that NKH1+T3+ cells represent a unique population of NK-active cells in normal peripheral blood. Although these cells exhibit LGL morphology and NK activity, this appears to be mediated through a functional T cell-like receptor for target antigen.
3 In vivo modulation of CD1 and MHC class II expression by sheep afferent lymph dendritic cells. Comparison of primary and secondary immune responses. The experiments described in this article characterize the phenotypic and functional changes in afferent lymph cell populations that occur as a result of in vivo immune stimulation. During the primary immune response (in antigen-naive sheep) there are very transient increases in level of CD1 expression by subpopulations of dendritic cells (DC) but no alterations in cell kinetics or MHC class II expression. In contrast, secondary antigenic challenge (in primed sheep) into the drainage area of an afferent lymphatic causes profound changes in the cell output, characterized by a greater than threefold drop in total cell output on days 1-3 followed by an approximate fivefold rise on day 5. There is also a substantial increase in both the proportion of MHC class II-positive T lymphocytes (from 28 to 54%) and in the quantitative expression of class II by both DC and lymphocytes. Class II expression by DC increases five- to sixfold by day 5, while the level of expression of class II on lymphocytes approximately doubles. The increase in CD1 expression during the secondary response is more prolonged than during the primary response, being detectable between days 2 and 6 after challenge. The rise in class II affects the whole DC population, in contrast to CD1 where the increase affects only a subpopulation of cells. In terms of functional properties, afferent lymph DC isolated during a primary response show no alteration of their activity, whereas DC taken 4-5 d after secondary challenge are up to fivefold more active in their ability to present soluble antigen to primed autologous T cells and to antigen-specific cell lines as well as to stimulate in the MLR. The relative expression of class II correlates temporally with an increased capacity of DC to present antigen. Monoclonal anti-class II antibodies totally inhibit the in vitro assays but anti-CD1 antibodies have no effect. The previous paper has demonstrated that afferent DC can associate with antigen in vivo and can present that antigen to antigen-specific T cells. This article extends our knowledge of DC biology and demonstrates that DC, activated during secondary in vivo immune responses, have an enhanced ability to present an antigen, unrelated to that used for challenge, to specific T cell lines. This enhancement correlates directly with quantitative variation of expressed class II and not CD1 and suggests that this variation in class II expression plays a physiological role in in vivo immune regulation.
3 Polyclonal activation of human B lymphocytes by Fc fragments. I. Characterization of the cellular requirements for Fc fragment-mediated polyclonal antibody secretion by human peripheral blood B lymphocytes. Fc fragments derived from human immunoglobulin were found to be capable of inducing both a proliferative and polyclonal antibody response in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures. The cell population proliferating in response to Fc fragments belongs to the B cell lineage. Expression of polyclonal antibody formation requires the presence of both adherent monocytes and T cells. The role of the monocyte is to enzymatically cleave the Fc fragment into 19,000 mol wt Fc subfragments that are then able to induce polyclonal antibody secretion. Stimulation of polyclonal antibody production by Fc subfragments occurs in the absence of adherent monocytes but still requires the presence of T cells.
1 Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of the effectiveness and safety of buprenorphine and fentanyl in rats. Respiratory depression is a serious and potentially life-threatening side-effect of opioid therapy. The objective of this investigation was to characterize the relationship between buprenorphine or fentanyl exposure and the effectiveness and safety outcome in rats. Data on the time course of the antinociceptive and respiratory depressant effect were analyzed on the basis of population logistic regression PK-PD models using non-linear mixed effects modeling software (NONMEM). The pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and fentanyl were described by a three- and two-compartment model, respectively. A logistic regression model (linear logit model) was used to characterize the relationship between drug exposure and the binary effectiveness and safety outcome. For buprenorphine, the odds ratios (OR) were 28.5 (95% CI, 6.9-50.1) and 2.10 (95% CI, 0.71-3.49) for the antinociceptive and respiratory depressant effect, respectively. For fentanyl these odds ratios were 3.03 (95% CI, 1.87-4.21) and 2.54 (95% CI, 1.26-3.82), respectively. The calculated safety index (OR(antinociception)/OR(respiratory depression)) for fentanyl of 1.20 suggests that fentanyl has a low safety margin, implicating that fentanyl needs to be titrated with caution. For buprenorphine the safety index is 13.54 suggesting that buprenorphine is a relatively safe opioid.
3 Adherent cell function in murine T-lymphocyte antigen recognition. IV. Enhancement of murine T-cell antigen recognition by human leukocytic pyrogen. A macrophage-dependent, antigen-specific murine T-cell proliferation assay was utilized to examine the role of soluble products of murine and human adherent cells in the activation of T lymphocytes. Highly purified human leukocytic pyrogen, and supernates from both murine and human mononuclear phagocytes-macrophages stimulated the immune T-cell proliferative response to the multideterminant antigens dinitrophenyl-ovalbumin and keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The implications of these studies and the relationship of leukocytic pyrogen to human lymphocyte-activating factor are discussed.
3 Amastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi sustain an infective cycle in mammalian cells. The two main stages of development of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi found in the vertebrate host are the trypomastigote and the amastigote. It has been generally assumed that only trypomastigotes are capable of entering cells and that amastigotes are the intracellular replicative form of the parasite. We show here that after incubation for 4 h with human monocytes in vitro 90% or more of extracellularly derived (24 h) amastigotes of T. cruzi are taken up by the cells. Within 2 h they escape the phagocytic vacuole and enter the cytoplasm, where they divide and after 4-5 d transform into trypomastigotes. Trypomastigotes also invade cultured human monocytes. However, they show a lag of several hours between invasion and the start of DNA duplication, while amastigotes commence replication without an apparent lag. Amastigotes also infect cultured fibroblasts, albeit with lower efficiency. When injected intraperitoneally into mice, amastigotes are as infective as trypomastigotes. Based on these results, and on prior findings that amastigotes are found free in the circulation of mice during the acute stage of the disease (3), it seems likely that the cellular uptake of amastigotes can initiate an alternative subcycle within the life cycle of this parasite in the mammalian host. Also, because trypomastigotes and amastigotes have diverse surface antigens, they may use different strategies to invade host cells.
0 Sequence analysis and expression of an X-linked, lymphocyte-regulated gene family (XLR). The XLR gene family consists of approximately 10 X-linked genes, the expression of which is regulated in lymphocyte development. Certain members of the gene family are closely linked to the murine xid immune deficiency mutation. Sequence analysis of a cDNA clone pM1 derived from the plasmacytoma MOPC167 showed an open reading frame capable of coding for a protein of 208 amino acids and mol wt 24,000. The lack of a signal peptide or transmembrane region indicates a probable cytoplasmic or nuclear localization for the predicted pM1 protein. The predicted protein shares significant homology with lamins A and C and other members of the intermediate filament family of proteins, and shares features important for the coiled-coil structure proposed for these proteins. Analysis of cDNA clones derived from a presecretory lymphoma and from adult thymus indicates that B and T lymphocytes transcribe a common major mRNA identical to pM1, while other rare transcripts were also identified by these studies. A series of clonal T lymphoma lines representing distinct stages of thymic differentiation showed that, as with B lymphoid tumors, XLR expression is correlated with the maturation of the thymomas.
2 Characterization of gP85gag as an antigen recognized by Moloney leukemia virus-specific cytolytic T cell clones that function in vivo. The gag membrane protein gP85gag, encoded by Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV), was identified as a target molecule recognized by Moloney murine sarcoma virus--M-MLV (M-MSV--M-MLV)-specific cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones. Target cells infected with Ab-X-MLV, an M-MLV-derived mutant virus not encoding gP85gag, were not lysed by the CTL clones. The same CTL clones were shown previously to induce the destruction of M-MLV-induced tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity. We have now characterized CTL-resistant antigen-loss tumor cell variants that have lost the surface antigen, but which retain transcriptionally silent M-MLV genomes. A cloned antigen-loss variant that reverted in vitro to the CTL-susceptible phenotype reexpressed M-MLV genomes that had undergone an insertion event in the region of the viral DNA coding for the gag membrane protein. Intravenous injection of virus-specific CTL clones inhibited tumor formation in mice injected subcutaneously with M-MSV--M-MLV.
3 Antigen- and receptor-driven regulatory mechanisms. I. Induction of suppressor T cells with anti-idiotypic antibodies. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to the azobenzenearsonate (ABA) hapten can be readily induced in A/J mice injecting ABA-coupled syngeneic spleen cells subcutaneously. To further characterize this T-cell-dependent immunological phenomenon, the effect of passively administered anti-cross-reactive idiotype common to anti-ABA antibodies of A/J mice (CRI) antibodies on the development of ABA-specific DTH was investigated. Animals given daily injections (of minute amounts) of anti-CRI antibodies subsequent to immunization with ABA-coupled cells show significant reduction of ABA specific responses. This inhibition is antigen specific and requires the intact immunoglobulin molecule, as F(ab')2 treatments were ineffective in suppressing the reaction. Investigations of the mechanism of the anti-CRI-induced suppression of ABA DTH revealed that the observed suppression is a result of the activation of suppressor cells. Spleen cells taken from animals which received anti-CRI antibodies were able to adoptively transfer suppression to naive recipients. This suppression was shown to be mediated by T cells, as anti-Thy1.2 plus complement completely abrogated the transfer of suppression. In addition, animals pretreated with low doses of cyclophosphamide were not suppressed by the administration of anti-CRI antibodies. The genetic restriction of anti-CRI-induced suppression was demonstrated. Antibodies to the major cross-reactive idiotype, (CRI) associated with anti-ABA antibodies in A/J mice were unable to suppress the development of DTH to ABA in BALB/c mice (H-2d, Igh-1a). Such antibodies were, however, fully active in suppressing ABA DTH in the allotype-congenic C.AL-20 strain which has an allotype (Igh-1d) similar to that of A/J (Igh-1e) on a BALB/c background, and which produces humoral antibodies with the CRI.
1 Linkage analysis of the murine interferon-alpha locus on chromosome 4. Southern blot analysis with a murine interferon-alpha2 (MuIFN-alpha2) cDNA probe revealed restriction fragment polymorphism of EcoRI- and HindIII-digested C57BL/6 and BALB/cDNA. The inheritance pattern of this polymorphism was examined using DNA from each of the seven recombinant inbred strains derived from C57BL/6 and BALB/c; the strain distribution pattern suggests linkage of INF-alpha genes to two histocompatibility loci on chromosome 4. Southern blot analysis of DNA from six bilinear congenic strains carrying different fragments of the BALB/c chromosome 4 on a C57BL/6 background showed linkage of IFN-alpha genes to the histocompatibility locus H-15. It can therefore be concluded that the IFN-alpha gene cluster is situated on chromosome 4 near the H-15 locus, between loci Mup-1 and b.
2 Kinetic study of T lymphocytes after sensitization against soluble antigen. III. Potentiation and suppression of the PHA response by antigen-activated lymphocytes of low density. Lymph node cells of ovalbumin-sensitized rats were separated on the basis of buoyant density into fractions reciprocally enriched in cells responsive to ovalbumin or phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Recombination of high density and low density fractions in varying proportions resulted in potentiation or suppression of the DNA synthetic response to PHA in culture. The response of cultures containing equal numbers of high and low density cells was markedly greater than the sum of the two populations stimulated separately. However, when decreasing numbers of low density cells were cultured with a constant number of high density cells, profound suppression was observed.
3 An immunoglobulin light chain from a lupus-prone mouse induces autoantibodies in normal mice. Autoantibodies against the 70-kD U1 RNP nucleoprotein autoantigen and DNA were elicited in normal BALB/c mice with a purified Ig light chain. This light chain, derived from a lupus-prone MRL-lpr/lpr mouse, has two distinctive properties: it contains an idiotypic marker recognized by a monoclonal MRL-lpr/lpr anti-snRNP autoantibody, and the amino acid sequence of its third hypervariable region (CDR3) is homologous to a sequence in an antigenic region of the 70-kD U1 RNP polypeptide. The results demonstrate that an Ig idiotype that mimics an autoantigen can induce autoimmunization.
3 Transformed lymphocytes from Abelson-diseased mice express levels of a B lineage transformation-associated antigen elevated from that found on normal lymphocytes. Animals injected with Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) rapidly develop fatal bone marrow-derived lymphosarcomas. In all such diseased animals tested, a subpopulation of bone marrow cells expressed a monoclonal antibody-defined, B lineage transformation-associated antigen (6C3 Ag) at levels increased from that detected on normal lymphocytes. Cells bearing a high level of this antigen were found to be transformed as measured by clonal growth in agar, and they expressed surface antigen markers characteristic of early pre-B cells. High-level antigen-expressing cells were found in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen, but never in the thymus of diseased animals. This distribution agrees with the published pathology of Abelson disease.
2 Natural resistance of lethally irradiated F1 hybrid mice to parental marrow grafts is a function of H-2/Hh-restricted effectors. The natural resistance of F1 hybrid mice against parental bone marrow grafts is thought to be mediated by natural killer (NK)-like effector cells. However, unlike the NK cell activity against a wide range of tumors and normal cells, hybrid resistance is characterized by the immunogenetic specificity controlled by a set of unique noncodominant genes denoted as Hh. Two alternative hypotheses can account for the specificity. Thus, the specificity may reflect either the Hh restriction of effectors or the Hh gene control of mechanisms regulating non-Hh-restricted effector activity. In this study, therefore, we tested the recognition specificity of putative effectors mediating hybrid resistance in lethally irradiated H-2b/d and H-2b/k F1 hybrid mice to the engraftment of parental H-2b bone marrow. As a direct means of defining the effector specificity, rejection of parental bone marrow grafts was subjected to competitive inhibition in situ by irradiated tumor cells. Of the 16 independent lines of lymphoma and other hemopoietic tumor cells tested, the ability to inhibit hybrid resistance was the exclusive property of all tumors derived from mice homozygous for the H-2Db region, regardless of whether the tumor cells were susceptible or resistant to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. Four cell lines heterozygous for the H-2Db were noninhibitory, including one that is susceptible to natural killing. Pretreatment of the F1 hosts with an interferon inducer augmented the resistance with no alteration in the recognition specificity of effector cells. Therefore, natural resistance to parental H-2b bone marrow grafts was mediated by effectors restricted by the H-2Db/Hh-1b gene(s), and not by the nonrestricted NK cells detectable in conventional in vitro assays.
0 Role of I-region gene products in macrophage induction of an antibody response. II. Restriction at the level of T cell in recognition of I-J-subregion macrophage determinants. The effect of specific anti-I-J reagents on macrophage-T cell interactions was studied in an in vitro antibody response to burro erythrocytes. Macrophages were prepared from the spleens of F1 hybrid mice whose parental strains differed at the I-J subregion. Two F1 hybrids were used for these experiments, [B10.A(3R) X B10.A(5R)]F1 and [B10.S(9R) X B10.HTT]F1. F1 macrophages responded equally well with F1 T-B cells or with T-B cells of either parental strain. When F1 macrophages were pretreated with anti-I-J serum (without complement) specific for one parental haplotype, they were only able to cooperate with T helper (TH) cells of the unblocked haplotype and with F1 TH cells. Identical results were obtained with (Jb X Jk)F1 and (Js X Jk)F1 mice. The results indicate that TH cells possess genetically restricted receptors for macrophage I-J-subregion gene products and that the interaction between this receptor and the macrophage I-J-subregion determinants is essential for the initiation of a primary in vitro antibody response to an erythrocyte antigen.
3 Insights into native epitopes of proliferating cell nuclear antigen using recombinant DNA protein products. A cDNA clone encoding full-length human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was used to generate a panel of in vitro translated labeled protein products with COOH-terminal deletions and to construct a set of fusion proteins with COOH- and NH2-terminal deletions. A rabbit antiserum raised against an NH2-terminal peptide, a well-characterized murine monoclonal antibody (mAb), and 14 human lupus sera with autoantibody to PCNA were analyzed for their reactivity with the constructs using both immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting techniques. The rabbit antiserum reacted in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with constructs containing the appropriate NH2-terminal sequence and mAb reacted with a sequence from the midregion of PCNA. These experimentally induced antibodies also reacted with 15-mer synthetic peptides in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In contrast, none of the lupus sera reacted with synthetic peptides in ELISA. 9 of the 14 lupus sera also failed to react in Western immunoblotting with any recombinant fusion protein, although they all immunoprecipitated in vitro translated full-length protein. Four of the nine had variable patterns of immunoprecipitation with shorter constructs. The remaining five lupus sera were able to immunoprecipitate translation products as well as Western blot recombinant fusion proteins. From analysis of the patterns of reactivity of human lupus sera, it was deduced that the apparent heterogeneity of human autoantibodies to PCNA could be explained by immune response to highly conformational epitopes. These observations demonstrate that there might be special features in "native" epitopes of intranuclear antigens that are recognized by autoantibodies, and that these special features of native epitopes might not be present in prepared antigen used for experimental immunization. These features may be related to protein folding or to association of the antigen with other intranuclear proteins or nucleic acids, as might occur with antigens that are components of subcellular particles.
3 Constitutive expression of high affinity interleukin 2 receptors on human CD16-natural killer cells in vivo. The majority of human NK cells express low affinity IgG Fc receptors (CD16+), whereas a minor subset of NK cells lack Fc receptor expression (CD16-). In contrast to CD16+ NK cells that express only p75 IL-2 receptors, CD16- NK cells constitutively co-express both p75 and p55 IL-2 receptors in vivo and preferentially respond to low concentrations of IL-2 with increased cytolytic activation and proliferation. Scatchard analysis demonstrated the presence of approximately 1,200 high affinity (approximately 25 pM kD) and approximately 9,600 intermediate affinity (approximately 2 nM kD) IL-2 receptors on CD16- NK cells. CD16+ NK cells expressed only a single intermediate affinity IL-2 receptor of approximately 1.9 nM kD (approximately 9,000 sites per cell). The IL-2 binding data thus substantiated the phenotypic and functional studies and definitively show that the differential responsiveness of CD16- and CD16+ NK cells to IL-2 is manifested through different affinity IL-2 receptors.
3 Frequency of B lymphocytes responsive to anti-immunoglobulin. The frequency of murine B lymphocytes that respond to antibodies directed against membrane IgM was measured. These anti-mu antibodies induced all, or almost all, resting B cells to enlarge over the first 24 h of stimulation. This probably represents the transition from the resting state (G0) to active transit through the cell cycle. In contrast, only a fraction of these cells, approximately 60% for BDF1 mice, continued through the cell cycle into S phase. This is consistent with previous experiments that had suggested there were some types of B cells that did not proliferate in response to anti-mu. The results presented here demonstrate that many, perhaps all, of these nonresponding B cells, both from normal mice and from mice with the xid defect, actually do respond to the presence of anti-mu by going through early parts of the cell cycle. These cells appear to become blocked at some point before the beginning of S phase, perhaps requiring a signal from a T cell or a macrophage to continue through the cell cycle. Thus, the role of antigen may be to prepare all B cells for proliferation. Different subpopulations of B cells may then require different regulatory signals before actually proliferating or before differentiating into antibody-secreting cells.
0 Genetic analysis of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha/cachectin promoter region in a macrophage cell line. The 615-bp 5' flanking region of the human TNF-alpha/cachectin gene was isolated and ligated to the luciferase reporter gene. In addition, a series of truncated promoter constructs was generated by exonuclease III digestion. The promoter activity of these constructs was studied in a transient transfection system using the TNF-alpha-producing U937 cell line. Full-length and truncated TNF promoter constructions extending from -615 to -95 bp relative to the transcription start site (TSS) could be induced by phorbol esters. A construct truncated to within 36 bp of the TSS (and within 11 bp of the TATAA box) was inactive. Therefore, the phorbol ester responsive is localized in the TNF/cachectin promoter to a relatively short region proximal to the TATAA box.
2 Mixed chimerism and permanent specific transplantation tolerance induced by a nonlethal preparative regimen. The use of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation as a means of inducing donor-specific tolerance across MHC barriers could provide an immunologically specific conditioning regimen for organ transplantation. However, a major limitation to this approach is the toxicity of whole body irradiation as currently used to abrogate host resistance and permit marrow engraftment. The present study describes methodology for abrogating host resistance and permitting marrow engraftment without lethal irradiation. Our preparative protocol involves administration of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAbs in vivo, 300-rad WBI, 700-rad thymic irradiation, and unmanipulated fully MHC-disparate bone marrow. B10 mice prepared by this regimen developed stable mixed lymphohematopoetic chimerism without any clinical evidence of graft-vs.-host disease. Engraftment was accompanied by induction of specific tolerance to donor skin grafts (B10.D2), while third-party skin grafts (B10.BR) were promptly rejected. Mice treated with the complete regimen without bone marrow transplantation appeared healthy and enjoyed long-term survival. This study therefore demonstrates that stable mixed chimerism with donor-specific tolerance can be induced across an MHC barrier after a nonlethal preparative regimen, without clinical GVHD and without the risk of aplasia.
1 The defect in Fas mRNA expression in MRL/lpr mice is associated with insertion of the retrotransposon, ETn. Fas is a cell surface protein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor, nerve growth factor receptor, CD40 family, and is involved in the control of lymphocyte apoptosis. A mutation in the Fas gene in MRL/lpr mice results in massive lymphoproliferation (lpr) and accelerated autoimmunity. To further study the nature of this defect, Fas mRNA expression was evaluated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction as well as by Northern blotting. These studies revealed that the wild-type Fas message was produced at approximately 10-fold lower levels in the lpr compared with the ++ substrain of MRL mice. In addition to the wild-type transcript, lpr mice also synthesized chimeric transcripts containing an insertion of the early retrotransposon (ETn). Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of a Fas-ETn chimeric cDNA suggested that the striking reduction in wild-type Fas mRNA levels and the presence of aberrant transcripts in MRL/lpr mice are most likely explained by the insertion of the ETn retrotransposon into an intron of the Fas gene and induction of alternative splicing involving the 5' ETn long terminal repeat.
0 Murine interstitial nephritis. I. Analysis of disease susceptibility and its relationship of pleiomorphic gene products defining both immune-response genes and a restrictive requirement for cytotoxic T cells at H-2K. Anti-tubular basement membrance (alpha TBM) disease-producing interstitial nephritis in mice is not dependent on the generation of alpha TBM antibodies. Susceptibility seems to be defined by very private specificities in H-2K. These specificities are pleiomorphic, providing both immune-response genes and identity restrictions for cytotoxic effector functions expressed by a Thy-1.2+, Lyt-2,3+ T cell. These studies establish a role for T cells in the pathogenesis in interstitial nephritis as well as providing further evidence for the role of H-2K in the expression of an autoimmune disease.
1 Auricular chondritis in rats. An experimental model of relapsing polychondritis induced with type II collagen. Outbred Wistar rats immunized with native type II collagen developed ear lesions resembling those of human relapsing chondritis. As in human disease, these lesions were characterized by intense chondritis, positive immunofluorescence reactions to IgG and C3, and circulating IgG reactive with native type II collagen. Furthermore, electron-dense deposits were seen near the surface of chondrocytes and corresponded with deposits of IgG and C3. These observations suggest a causal relation between humoral immunity to type II collagen and auricular chondritis in the rat and support the hypothesis than human relapsing polychondritis is an autoimmune disease mediated by immunity to type II collagen.
3 Interleukin-induced increase in Ia expression by normal mouse B cells. The constitutive culture supernatant (SN) of the macrophage tumor line P388D1 (P388 SN) and the concanavalin A (Con A)-induced culture supernatant of the T cell hybridoma FS6-14.13 (FS6 Con A SN) were shown to contain nonspecific factors capable of inducing increased Ia expression by normal resting B cells in a dose-dependent manner. In six consecutive experiments the relative increase in Ia expression induced by P388 SN was 4.9 +/- 0.9, with FS6 Con A SN 10.7 +/- 1.5, and with a combination of both preparations 13.0 +/- 1.7. This increase in Ia expression was observed to occur in virtually all the B cells, reaching maximum levels within 24 h of culture. The interleukin-induced increase in B cell Ia expression occurred in the absence of ancillary signals provided by ligand-receptor Ig cross-linking and despite the fact that virtually all the control B cells, cultured in the absence of factors, remained in G0. These results suggest that functional receptors for at least some interleukins are expressed on normal resting B cells and their effects can be manifest in the absence of additional activating signals. The increased Ia expression induced by the nonspecific factor preparations was shown to be correlated with enhanced antigen-presenting capacity by the B cells to T cell hybridomas. The nature of the interleukins responsible for these effects remains to be definitively determined, however, the activity of FS6 Con A SN was shown to correlate with B cell growth factor activity and increased B cell Ia expression was not observed using interleukin 2 (IL-2) or interferon-gamma, prepared by recombinant DNA technology.
3 Lymphocyte-induced angiogenesis: a quantitative and sensitive assay of the graft-vs.-host reaction. A new and sensitive assay for the effect of intracutanous administration of immunocompentent lymphocytes into the skin of irradiated unimmunized mice is described. The assay, which we have termed lymphocyte-induced angiogenesis (LIA) involves enumeration of new vascular branches induced by the action of these competent cells. As is the case for the previously described normal lymphocyte transfer reaction, LIA is a manifestation of the graft-vs.-host reaction, as shown by experiments utilizing appropaiate genetic combinations. The reaction is dose-dependent, and within the dose range of 2 times 10 minus 5 -4 times 10-6 cells the mumber of vessels induced correlates with the mumber of immunocompetent cells injected. At these dose levels spleen, lumph node, and hydrocortisone-resistant thymocytes are effective; bone marrow and thymus cells are not. Spleen cells from nude mice are incapable of inducing LIA, while mitomycin-C and irradiated lymphocytes can initiate but not maintain the reaction. The relationship between lymphocyte-induced angiogenesis has been discussed as have the implications of these findings to delayed hypersensitivity, inflammation, and vascular pathology.
3 Mechanism of suppression of lipopolysaccharide-driven B cell differentiation by anti-mu antibodies. Evidence for a trans-acting repressor of transcription. Bivalent anti-mu antibodies suppress LPS-driven B cell differentiation by inhibiting the coordinate activation of a family of differentiation-related genes, including those encoding the heavy, light, and J chains of IgM. We have shown that the presence of inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis during a pulse with anti-mu can interfere with induction of suppression. We suggest that suppression is mediated by a trans-acting repressor protein with specificity for common motifs in regulatory regions of each of these genes.
3 Antigen-induced co-capping of IgM and IgD-like receptors on murine B cells. Double fluorescence studies indicated that most mature lymphocytes of 11-52-wk-old mice possess both IgM and IgD-like surface immunoglobulins, while spleen cells from neonatal mice possess surface IgM only. These molecules cap independently with class-specific antisera, but co-cap when capping is induced by antigen. It is proposed that the two heavy chains on individual lymphocytes possess similar or identical antigen-combining sites.
3 Human hematopoietic progenitor cells in long-term cultures express HLA-DR antigens and lack HLA-DQ antigens. The expression of HLA-DR antigenic determinants on human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) capable of differentiating into mature blood cells, as determined in semisolid cultures, has been demonstrated previously (3-7). Here, we investigated the expression of class II determinants on HPC responsible for the sustained proliferation of colony-forming units of granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), of multilineage HPC (CFU-GEMM, granulocyte/erythrocyte/macrophage/megakaryocyte), and burst-forming units of erythroid cells (BFU-E) in liquid long-term cultures. Using both fluorescence-activated cell sorting and complement-dependent cytotoxicity assays, HLA-DR determinants could be identified on virtually all these HPC capable of proliferating in long-term cultures. Experiments in which the stromal layer had been irradiated provided evidence that the HPC themselves were truly HLA-DR+, and that the sustained proliferation of HPC was not due to activation of HLA-DR- residual HPC in the stromal layer by reinoculated HLA-DR+ accessory cells. Furthermore, it was shown that all HPC recognized in semisolid and liquid long-term cultures were HLA-DQ-. These results suggest that the human true pluripotential stem cell is HLA-DR+. These results open the possibility of studying class II-dependent regulation of hematopoiesis in liquid long-term cultures.
3 Identification of a clonally restricted 90 kD heterodimer on two human cloned natural killer cell lines. Its role in cytotoxic effector function. The present studies were carried out to identify surface molecules involved in the cytotoxic effector function of a human natural killer (NK) clone termed JT9. This clone represents a mature T lymphocyte (T3+T8+T11+) mediating NK-like activity. Using JT9 for immunization, one monoclonal antibody termed anti-NKTa was selected that blocked the cytotoxicity of the clone towards K562 cells. Reactivity of anti-NKTa antibody was assessed using a large panel of lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells including a variety of cloned cell lines with either cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) or NK-like activity. Among all cells tested, only two individual clones, JT9 and JT10, were found to express NKTa antigen. JT10 was derived independently from the same individual as JT9 and also represents a mature T cell (T3+T8+T11+) mediating NK-like activity. Like the Ti structure on CTL clones, the molecule defined by anti-NKTa was shown to be membrane associated with T3 in co-modulation experiments. Moreover, anti-NKTa precipitated a 90 kD heterodimeric structure in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of 125I surface-labeled JT9 cells. The blocking capacity of anti-NKTa was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays using a panel of target cells. The influence of anti-T3 was tested in parallel and it was found that both anti-NKTa and anti-T3 blocked the cytotoxicity of the cloned cells against all targets. Given the potential role of 90 kD molecules as antigen-receptor structures, the specificity of the two NKTa+ NK clones was compared and found superimposable when assessed using 15 in vitro established cell lines. However, in contrast to conventional CTL clones, the expression of cytotoxicity by JT9 and JT10 was not dependent upon recognition of class I or class II major histocompatibility complex gene products on the target cells. In addition, the cytotoxicity of these T8+ NK active clones could not be blocked by anti-T8 antibodies. Taken together, the present data suggest that the specificity of one population of human NK active lymphocytes is determined by clonotypic structures. The NKTa determinant identified here appears to belong to the same family of molecules as Ti structures, previously identified on antigen-specific T lymphocytes.
3 Macrophages genetically resistant to mouse hepatitis virus converted in vitro to susceptible macrophages. Genetic resistance to mouse hepatitis, which resides largely in the macrophages of resistant C3H mice, may be altered by exposing the cells in vitro to fluid from allogeneic mixed lymphocytes. A 1,000-fold increase in susceptibility was produced in these genetically resistant cells by exposure to this fluid. This presumed lymphokine was effective without producing any change in host adaption of the virus.
3 B lymphocytes may escape tolerance by revising their antigen receptors. To explore mechanisms that prevent autoreactivity in nonautoimmune mice, endogenous immunoglobulin (Ig) light (L) chains that associate with a transgenic anti-DNA heavy chain were analyzed. The antibodies from splenic B cell hybridomas of such mice did not bind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and their L chain sequences showed a biased use of V kappa and J kappa gene segments. The 44 L chains in this survey were coded for by just 18 germline genes. Six of the genes, each belonging to a different V kappa group, were used more than once and accounted for three fourths of all sequences. Based on the distribution of V kappa genes, the L chain repertoire in this line of transgenic mice was estimated at 37 V kappa genes. The most frequently observed gene, a member of the V kappa 12/13 group, was identified in 16 hybrids. In addition, the majority of V kappa genes used J kappa 5. We interpret the skewed representation of V kappa and J kappa gene segments to result from negative selection. Based on the data, we suggest that V kappa rearrangements giving rise to anti-dsDNA reactivity are removed from the repertoire by a corrective mechanism capable of editing self-reactive Ig.
3 Somatically generated mouse myeloma variants synthesizing IgA half-molecules. Whereas mouse myelomas that secrete IgA half-molecules have been shown to arise in vivo, their origin has not been definitely established. We show that somatic variants secreting phenotypically similar molecules can arise directly from the normal IgA-secreting myelomas S107 and W3082. In addition to being improperly assembled, the variant proteins have distinct carboxy-terminal deletions and an aberrant heavy-light chain disulfide bond. For at least one of the variants, variable region serology and affinity for hapten are both unaffected by these changes. Southern and Northern blot analyses indicate normal size DNA restriction fragments and mRNA, suggesting premature termination as the mechanism of deletion. These results are discussed in relation to possible mutational hot spots and long-range interdomain interactions.
3 Nitric oxide. A macrophage product responsible for cytostasis and respiratory inhibition in tumor target cells. A metabolic pathway of activated macrophages (M phi) involving oxidation of the guanido nitrogens of L-arginine is required for inhibition of growth and respiration of some target cells. The goal of this study was to identify the M phi metabolite(s) that induce these injuries. The stable products of the L-arginine pathway, NO2- and NO3-, were incapable of causing cytostasis under coculture conditions. However, NO2- became cytostatic upon mild acidification, which favors its transformation into nitrogen oxides of greater reactivity. This suggested that NO. (and/or NO2), recently identified as an M phi metabolite of L-arginine, could be a mediator. Authentic NO. caused cytostasis and respiratory inhibition in L1210 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The mitochondrial lesions caused by NO. were confined to complex 1 and 2, a pattern of injury identical to that seen after coculture with activated M phi. Inclusion of NO. scavenger systems prevented cytostasis from developing in M phi-L1210 cocultures. Thus, M phi-generated NO. can account for L-arginine-dependent cytostasis and respiratory inhibition.
3 Role of the thymus in directing the development of a subset of B lymphocytes. In an effort to evaluate the role of the thymus in influencing the development of Lyb-5- B lymphocytes, mice expressing both the xid and nu gene defects were studied. Mice expressing either of these defects respond to both trinitrophenylated Brucellus abortus and lipopolysaccharide; whereas mice with the combined defect show markedly suppressed responses. The other abnormalities included: (a) greater than 80 percent diminution of serum Ig levels; (b) significant increase in the number of sIgM+ sIgD- B lymphocytes; (c) reduced expression of IgD on sIgD+ cells; and (d) a strikingly abnormal histology of their lymphoid tissue. Because nu/nu mice that do not express the xid defect appear relatively normal, it would suggest that the development of Lyb-5- B lymphocytes require a thymic influence for normal maturation, whereas, Lyb-5+ B lymphocytes are relatively independent of such influences.
0 The severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mouse. A laboratory model for the analysis of Lyme arthritis and carditis. We report that the spirochete B. burgdorferi induces progressive polyarthritis and carditis in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (scid) but not in normal C.B-17 mice. The onset and severity of the disease were dependent on (a) the viability; (b) the infectivity; and (c) the dose of inoculated B. burgdorferi organisms. Infective spirochetes were isolated from both blood and joints of inoculated scid mice. These findings suggest that B. burgdorferi-induced chronic arthritis and carditis in mice develops independently of lymphocyte function and makes the scid mouse an attractive laboratory model to study the role of the immune system in experimental Lyme Borreliosis.
3 Binding of monomeric immunoglobulins to Fc receptors of mouse macrophages. The binding properties of surface receptors of immunoglobulins on mouse macrophages were studied with mouse myeloma proteins and normal peritoneal macrophages, thioglycollate-stimulated macrophages, and a macrophage cell line, P388D1. Primary cultures of mouse embryo fibroblasts served as controls. IgG2a proteins were bound strongly;IgG2b was bound weakly (one-twentieth as well as IgG2a);IgM, IgA, and IgG1 were not bound significantly. The number of binding sites per cell for IgG2a was 4 X 10(5) for thioglycollate-stimulated cells and 1 X 10(5) for normal and P388D1 cells. Binding was exothermal: with decreasing temperature the equilibrium (association) constants increased and dissociation rate constants decreased (at 37degreesC the respective values were 2 X 10(7) M-1 and 0.26 min-1, the latter value corresponds to a half time for dissociation of 2.6 min). From the rapidity of association and dissociation, it appears that the surface of the macrophage is in a dynamic equilibrium with IgG2a molecules in the cell's immediate microenvironment. The receptors for IgG2a are clearly specific for determinants in the immunoglobulin constant domain: two IgG2a proteins with greatly different isoelectric points (determined by isoelectric focusing) were bound with the same affinity to the same receptors; moreover, the Fc fragment was bound and Fab fragments were not. The Fc receptors for IgG2a proteins were readily eliminated by exposing macrophages briefly to trypsin. The receptors were regenerated during subsequent cultivation in serum-free medium; regeneration was inhibited totally by cycloheximide and partially by actinomycin D.
3 Prostaglandins from human T suppressor/cytotoxic cells modulate natural killer antibacterial activity. We have recently described potent antibacterial activity of purified human NK cells. Here we show that this function is regulated by T cytotoxic/suppressor CD8+ cells. Thus, coculture of NK and CD8+ cells for 3 h or longer times abrogated the expression of the NK antibacterial activity, and of two activation markers IL-2R and transferrin receptor (Tf-R). The suppressive activity was mediated by PGE2 as demonstrated by direct PGE2 determination in CD8+ cell free supernatants, and by inhibition of CD8+ cell suppression with indomethacin or piroxicam in vitro. We also found that resting T cytotoxic/suppressor cells purified by negative selection produce higher amounts of PGE2 than adherent cells like monocytes and macrophages, and that these concentration levels are in the range of concentrations known to suppress a significant number of in vitro immunologic functions.
3 Idiotypy of clonal responses to influenza virus hemagglutinin. Anti-idiotype antisera were raised in syngeneic (BALB/c mice) and homologous (A/J mice) systems to study the cross-reactive idiotypes among monoclonal antibodies to PR8 and B/Lee virus HA and the expression of these idiotypes during primary and secondary antiviral responses of BALB/c mice. Extensive idiotypic cross-reactivity was demonstrated among monoclonal antibodies specific for distinct antigenic determinants on PR8 hemagglutinin (HA). The study of idiotypy of monoclonal antibodies against the same or overlapping antigenic determinants on B/Lee HA showed that these monoclonal antibodies may bear (a) a true individual idiotype not shared by other monoclonal antibodies, (b) idiotypes shared by few monoclonal antibodies, and (c) true cross-reactive idiotypes shared by all of these monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, no cross-reactive idiotypes were detectable among monoclonal antibodies to B/Lee HA and monoclonal antibodies to PR8 HA. Furthermore, we have shown that the anti-idiotype antibodies we used recognize determinants on monoclonal antibodies closely associated with antigenic binding sites. Finally, studies of the idiotypes expressed during primary and secondary antiviral HA responses of mice immunized with B/Lee virus revealed persistence of some idiotypes during both primary and secondary responses, whereas others were only expressed in the primary or secondary response.
2 Two distinct antigen-specific suppressor factors induced by the oral administration of antigen. The feeding of sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) to mice leads to the production of two distinct T cell-derived suppressor factors by spleen cells. Each has been characterized for specificity, genetic restrictions, and cellular interactions. Fraction I has a 60,000-75,000 mol wt, is specific for antigen, and is suppressive of primary in vitro anti-SRBC responses at all times. It is not restricted by major histocompabitility complex (MHC)- or Igh-linked genes, but it fails to suppress spleen cells derived from any strain of mouse with a B10 background. It acts on an Lyt-2+ T cell to increase suppressive activity. An antiserum has been prepared against this factor that reacts with other, unrelated T cell suppressor factors. Fraction II has an approximately 30,000-40,000 mol wt, is specific for antigen, and has a dual effect on in vitro anti-SRBC responses. On day 3 of culture, it leads to augmentation of the response, whereas at day 5 it suppresses the response. It is not restricted by MHC genes, but it is restricted by Igh-linked genets. It acts by activating an Ly-1 t cell to both help and induce feedback suppression. These factors, and the antisera prepared against them, should allow more precise dissection of the molecular pathways by which immunoregulatory cells communicate with one another.
3 Abnormal ratio of membrane immunoglobulin classes in mice with an X-linked B-lymphocyte defect. CBA/N mice have an X-linked genetic defect in B-lymphocyte function manifested by inability to make antibody responses to T-independent antigens. Plasma membrane immunoglobulin (Ig) on spleen, lymph node, and Peyer's patch cells was analyzed by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, NP-40 extraction, specific immunoprecipitation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These studies indicated that the X-linked immune defect was associated, in all three cell types, with a decrease in the ratio of cell membrane IgD analog to cell membrane IgM. This suggests either that IgD analog may be important in initiation of T-independent antibody responses or that CBA/N mice lack a subpopulation of B cells specialized to respond to T-independent antigens, and that these cells are relatively rich in plasma membrane IgD analog.
0 Growth of SJL/J-derived transplantable reticulum cell sarcoma as related to its ability to induce T-cell proliferation in the host. I. Dominant negative genetic influences of other parent haplotype in F1 hybrids of SJL/J mice. Growth of three transplantable reticulum cell sarcomas (RCS) was studied in a variety of F1 hybrids of SJL/J mice by determination of lymph node (LN) and spleen: body weights ratios 7 and 14 d after intravenous injection of RCS cells. Comparison of BIO.S x SJL and A.SW x SJL with SJL/J showed a negative effect of both the A and the BIO non-H-2 genes, particularly on growth in LN. F1 hybrid resistance was noted with F1 hybrids that carried H-2Dd and was much more evident with F1 hybrids from BIO- than from A-background mice. This resistance was less marked at 14 than at 7 d and was partially overcome by injection of higher tumor doses. Changing the I region in the F1 parent from H-2d to H-2b or H-2f had no effect on growth, but changing to H-2k or H-2d virtually abolished the ability to support tumor growth. This effect appeared partially as a result of the I-E/C and partially of the I-A(B) region and was not overcome by higher tumor dose or longer intervals after injection. There also appeared to be a negative influence on growth of H-2Kk, but this was difficult to differentiate from the I-Ak effect with the available strains. The known proliferative responsiveness that SJL/J Lyt-1 T cells exhibit to Ia determinants on gamma-irradiated RCS cells in vitro was also compared with that of cells from various F1 hybrids. Responsiveness of F1 LN cells was expressed as a percentage of the response in SJL/J LN cells to the same RCS cells, measured as [3H]thymidine incorporation. There was a striking degree of correlation between proliferative responsiveness of F1 LN cells to RCS and the ability of the F1 mice to support tumor growth. This correlation was especially clear with respect to the negative influences of non-H-2 genes, and of H-2 loci in the I region, particularly of I-Ak or -d and of I-E/Ck or -d, but there also appeared to be a (smaller) negative effect of I-Ab or -f. Negative influence of H-2Dd on growth, however, was not reflected in a similarly large effect on the proliferative response. Additional findings showed that LN cells from all F1 hybrids exhibited equivalent syngeneic mixed lymphocyte responses in the presence of polyethylene glycol to mitomycin-treated spleen cells from both the SJL/J and the other parent. The extra high response of F1 cells to RCS cells, as compared with SJL spleen cells, however, was always absent when Ik or -d was contributed by one of the F1 parents. The results suggest a promoting effect of the proliferative response on RCS growth in vivo and, furthermore, an interesting effect of I-A and I-E/C genes, possibly via an interaction product, on the ability of LN cells to be stimulated by Ia determinants on RCS cells.
1 Identification of the complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF) on epithelium and glandular cells and in body fluids. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is a 70 kD membrane regulatory protein that prevents the activation of autologous complement on cell surfaces. Using immunohistochemical methods and a radioimmunometric assay based on mAbs to DAF, we found large amounts of membrane-associated DAF antigen on the epithelial surface of cornea, conjunctiva, oral and gastrointestinal mucosa, exocrine glands, renal tubules, ureter and bladder, cervical and uterine mucosa, and pleural, pericardial and synovial serosa. Additionally, we detected soluble DAF antigen in plasma, tears, saliva, and urine, as well as in synovial and cerebrospinal fluids. While plasma, tear, and saliva DAF are larger than erythrocyte (Ehu) membrane DAF by Western blot analysis, urine DAF is slightly smaller (67,000) in Mr. Unlike purified Ehu DAF, however, urine DAF is unable to incorporate into the membrane of red cells. Although its inhibitory activity on the complement enzyme C3-convertase is lower than that of Ehu DAF, it is comparable to that of serum C4 binding protein (C4bp). Biosynthetic studies using cultured foreskin epithelium and Hela cells disclosed DAF levels (approximately 2 X 10(5) molecules/cell) exceeding those on blood cells. In addition, these studies revealed the synthesis of two DAF species, one with apparent Mr corresponding to that of epithelial cell membrane DAF and the other to urine DAF, suggesting that the urine DAF variant arises from adjacent epithelium. The function of DAF in body fluids is unknown, but the observation that urine DAF has C4bp-(or factor H-)like activity shows that it could inhibit the fluid phase activation of the cascade.
3 Identification of a T cell-derived b cell growth factor distinct from interleukin 2. We report here a factor (B cell growth factor) found in induced supernatants of the mouse thymoma EL4 that co-stimulates with anti-IgM antibodies in short-term cultures of purified B lymphocytes to induce polyclonal B cell proliferation but not antibody-forming cell production. The factor is not mitogenic for resting B cells and interacts with anti-IgM-activated B cells in a non-H-2-restricted manner. Absorption studies and molecular weight analysis reveal the factor is distinct from interleukin 2. This factor synergises with antigen, interleukin 2, and an interleukin 2-free, B cell growth factor-free T cell supernatant that contains T cell-replacing factor to produce erythrocyte-specific plaque-forming cells in cultures of highly purified B cells.
3 Are HIV positive patients resistant to statin therapy? Patients with HIV are subject to development of HIV metabolic syndrome characterized by dyslipidemia, lipodystrophy and insulin resistance secondary to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Rosuvastatin is a highly potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Rosuvastatin is effective at lowering LDL and poses a low risk for drug-drug interaction as it does not share the same metabolic pathway as HAART drugs. This study sought to determine the efficacy of rosuvastatin on lipid parameters in HIV positive patients with HIV metabolic syndrome. Mean TC decreased from 6.54 to 4.89 mmol/L (25.0% reduction, p < 0.001). Mean LDL-C decreased from 3.39 to 2.24 mmol/L (30.8% reduction, p < 0.001). Mean HDL rose from 1.04 to 1.06 mmol/L (2.0% increase, p = ns). Mean triglycerides decreased from 5.26 to 3.68 mmol/L (30.1% reduction, p < 0.001). Secondary analysis examining the effectiveness of rosuvastatin monotherapy (n = 70) vs. rosuvastatin plus fenofibrate (n = 43) showed an improvement of 21.3% in TG and a decrease of 4.1% in HDL-C in the monotherapy group. The rosuvastatin plus fenofibrate showed a greater drop in triglycerides (45.3%, p < 0.001) and an increase in HDL of 7.6% (p = 0.08). This study found that rosuvastatin is effective at improving potentially atherogenic lipid parameters in HIV-positive patients. The lipid changes we observed were of a smaller magnitude compared to non-HIV subjects. Our results are further supported by a small, pilot trial examining rosuvastatin effectiveness in HIV who reported similar median changes from baseline of -21.7% (TC), -22.4% (LDL-C), -30.1% (TG) with the exception of a 28.5% median increase in HDL. In light of the results revealed by this pilot study, clinicians may want to consider a possible resistance to statin therapy when treating patients with HIV metabolic syndrome.
3 Acquisition of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-specific carbohydrate differentiation antigens. Cytotoxic T cell (CTL)-specific activation antigens, termed CT determinants, have been detected by monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that inhibit CTL function. At the cell surface, the CT antigens are associated with the T200 glycoproteins and two other proteins of Mr 140,000 and 85,000 and are present on a secreted protein, gp155. Periodate treatment followed by binding analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments using tunicamycin-treated cells indicated that carbohydrate is necessary for CT antigen expression. Furthermore, gp155 is secreted in the presence of tunicamycin while retaining the CT antigens, and the CT determinants are added late in T200 biosynthesis, suggesting that the CT glycans are O-linked. Finally, interleukin 2 was shown to dramatically influence the expression of the CT mAb-reactive oligosaccharides present at the CTL cell surface.
3 Phenotypic characterization and ontogeny of mesodermal-derived and endocrine epithelial components of the human thymic microenvironment. Using murine monoclonal antibodies TE-4 and TE-7 raised against human thymic stroma, we identified two distinct and mutually exclusive thymic microenvironment components: the thymic endocrine epithelium (TE-4+) and mesodermal-derived fibrous stroma (TE-7+). TE-4-reactive epithelium did not react with antibody TE-7, contained thymosin alpha 1 and keratin, and expressed other known markers of thymic endocrine epithelium (A2B5 and p19). Moreover, TE-4+ thymic epithelial cells strongly expressed class I (HLA-A, -B and -C) and class II (Ia-like) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. In contrast, TE-7+ thymic fibrous stroma did not react with antibody TE-4, did not contain thymosin alpha 1 nor keratin, and did not express the thymic endocrine epithelium markers A2B5 and p19. TE-7+ thymic stromal cells weakly expressed class I and did not express class II MHC antigens. Both TE-4+ and TE-7+ thymic microenvironment compartments were identifiable in thymus from 7 wk gestation through adult life. At 7 wk fetal gestation, TE-7+ stroma surrounded a cylindrical TE-4+, A2B5+ thymic epithelial rudiment. Between 10 and 15 wk fetal gestation, TE-7+ thymic stroma surrounded early thymic lobules. By 15 wk fetal gestation, antibody TE-4 defined subcapsular cortical and medullary zones of endocrine thymic epithelium, while antibody TE-7 bound to interlobular fibrous septae, vessels, and thymic fibrous capsule. While otherwise specific for endocrine thymic epithelium, antibody TE-4 reacted with the basal layer of squamous epithelium in skin, tonsil, conjunctiva, and upper esophagus.
3 T cell-dependent induction of NF-kappa B in B cells. In comparison to B cell stimulation mediated by surface immunoglobulin (Ig) antigen receptor ligation, little is known about the intracellular events associated with T cell-dependent B cell responses. A model for the efferent phase of T cell-B cell interaction was used to examine the capacity of activated T cells to trigger nuclear expression of the trans-acting transcription factor, NF-kappa B, in B cells. Fixed, activated, but not fixed, resting Th2 cells were found to induce increased binding activity for a kappa B site-containing oligonucleotide in a time-dependent manner. This induction of NF-kappa B was eliminated by an antibody directed against a 39-kD cell interaction protein on activated T cells as well as by a soluble form of B cell CD40. Of particular relevance to intracellular signaling, NF-kappa B induction was not diminished by prior depletion of B cell protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol myristate acetate. These results strongly suggest that T cell-dependent B cell stimulation is associated with NF-kappa B induction via p39-CD40 interaction and that this is brought about by non-PKC dependent signaling, in marked contrast to the previously documented requirement for PKC in sIg receptor-mediated stimulation. This suggest that NF-kappa B responds to more than one receptor-mediated intracellular signaling pathway in B cells and may be part of a "final common pathway" for B cell stimulation.
3 The T cell repertoire for recognition of a phylogenetically distant protein antigen. Peptide specificity and MHC restriction of staphylococcal nuclease-specific T cell clones. Previous studies (1) have indicated that the repertoire of murine T cells specific for a potentially complex protein antigen is in fact specific for a limited number of antigenic epitopes on that antigen in association with a given Ia molecule. Since those studies generally analyzed responses to antigens that differ in only a few amino acids from homologous murine molecules, it was possible that tolerance to self proteins was responsible for the limited T cell repertoire seen in responses to closely related proteins. It was therefore of interest to determine whether T cell recognition of a structurally and phylogenetically more distant protein molecule would also show specificity for a limited number of immunodominant peptides on that molecule. A series of experiments was designed to study the antigen fine specificity and MHC restriction of T cell clones specific for the bacterially derived antigen staphylococcal nuclease (Nase). T cell clones generated in (H-2b X H-2a)F1 (B6AF1) T cells were shown to be specific for Nase and to be restricted by either Ab alpha Ab beta or Ek alpha Ek beta. The fine specificity of these clones was then analyzed using cyanogen bromide and tryptic fragments and a series of overlapping 20-amino-acid synthetic peptides corresponding to and spanning the entire sequence of the Nase molecule. Two Ab alpha Ab beta-restricted clones were highly responsive to peptide 91-110, and not to other synthetic Nase peptides. In contrast, seven Ek alpha Ek beta-restricted clones were consistently responsive to peptide 81-100 and not to 91-110 or to other Nase peptides. Certain of these Ek alpha Ek beta-restricted T cells expressed an interesting crossreactivity, in that they responded to peptide 51-70 as well as to 81-100, although the response to 51-70 was characterized by a markedly shifted dose-response curve, indicating a reduced efficiency of activation by this peptide. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of these regions indicates that this unexpected crossreaction may have a structural basis. A single Nase-specific T cell line generated from BALB/c T cells was, in contrast to any of the B6AF1 clones studied, responsive only to peptide 61-80 and not to other peptides, including 81-100 or 91-110. Collectively, these findings show that Nase-specific T cells are responsive to discrete Nase peptides. Moreover, the present findings suggest that in T cell recognition of a complex and highly foreign protein antigen, a limited number of peptide epitopes are preferentially recognized by T cells in association with a given Ia molecule.
0 Identification of Leishmania genes encoding proteins containing tandemly repeating peptides. A genomic Leishmania major DNA expression library was screened using antibodies raised against L. major membranes. Two different clones were identified that encoded proteins containing regions of tandemly repeated peptides. Clone 20 encodes a repetitive peptide of 14 amino acids, while clone 39 encodes a repetitive peptide of 10 amino acids. DNA from clone 20 hybridized with two RNA species of 9,500 and 5,200 nucleotides in length, while DNA from clone 39 hybridized to a single RNA species of 7,500 nucleotides. Antibodies against clone 20 fusion protein recognized a series of L. major proteins of apparent mol wt 250,000. Regions of repetitive peptides is a characteristic shared by many malarial protein antigens and this feature has been implicated in immune evasion. Intracellular parasites such as Leishmania and Plasmodia, therefore, may have evolved similar mechanisms consisting of the expression of proteins containing tandemly repeating peptides that are involved in immune evasion.
2 Animals bearing malignant grafts reject normal grafts that express through gene transfer the same antigen. Breaking the state of immunological unresponsiveness of tumor-bearing individuals to cancer is a prerequisite for active or passive tumor-specific immunotherapy. To study this problem the immunogenic MHC class I antigen, K216 was transfected into a progressor tumor. The transfected tumors were regularly rejected by normal mice but grew progressively in mice bearing nontransfected tumors. In addition, transgenic mice were derived to obtain normal cells and tissues expressing the same K216 gene product. Normal mice rejected K216-positive normal or malignant tissue grafts and generated K216-specific CTL in vitro and in vivo in response to these challenges. In contrast, mice bearing nontransfected tumors, though rejecting K216-positive nonmalignant tissue grafts, did not reject K216-positive tumors nor generate K216-specific CTL in response to K216-positive tumor cells. Mice bearing K216-positive tumors also rejected the nonmalignant K216-positive tissue grafts, but this in vivo response failed to lead to rejection of the simultaneously present tumor graft expressing the same antigen; in fact, immunity had no measurable effect whatsoever on tumor size or incidence and caused no selection for antigen loss variants. Taken together, the present findings suggest that transfer of expression of a target antigen into nonmalignant cells provides a way for obtaining effective stimulation of antigen-specific CTL in tumor-bearing mice, but that additional manipulations will be required to cause immunological rejection of established tumors.
3 Differential usage of three exons generates at least five different mRNAs encoding human leukocyte common antigens. Leukocyte common antigens (LCAs, also known as T200 and CD 45) are integral membrane proteins expressed exclusively on hematopoietic cells. These molecules exhibit varying molecular masses and epitopes when expressed in different cell types. To determine the genetic bases for the generation of this diversity, three classes of human LCA cDNA clones that are different near their 5' ends have been isolated. These differences arose as a result of differential usage of three exons as determined from an analysis of a genomic DNA clone. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis with LCA exon-specific probes demonstrates the existence of at least two more LCA mRNA forms that are generated by differential splicing. A comparison of the human and mouse LCA protein sequences revealed a marked difference only in the extracellular domain.
0 A genetic polymorphism in the constant region of rabbit b4 kappa chains. Amino acid sequence analysis of a b4 light chain from a rabbit homogeneous antistreptococcal antibody revealed the presence of two amino acid substitutions in the constant region not previously reported for these positions. These interchanges, consisting of serine for alanine at position 121 and leucine for glutamine at position 124, were also present in about 30% of the pooled b4 light chains isolated from pooled IgG from the rabbit (4539) that produced the homogeneous antibody. In addition, these interchanges (b4var) were found, always at the same levels, in varying percentages in nonimmune or early immune bleedings from related rabbits in this pedigreed family and could be traced for five generations. The inheritance pattern of b4var was consistent with autosomal codominant inheritance.
3 Inclusion group systems and cis-trans effects in responses controlled by the two complementing Ir-GLphi genes. The immune responses to the random linear terpolymers of L-amino acids, poly-(glu57, lys38, tyr5), poly-(glu51, lys34, tyr15,), and poly-(glu53, lys36, phe11) are each controlled by two dominant H-linked Ir genes. The immune responses to these three related terpolymers demonstrate different H-2 distributions, however, the H-2 patterns are part of a single inclusion group system. The alpha- and beta-genes are dominant; however, most effective gene interactions occur when the two genes are in the cis configuration. The potential significance of this cis-trans effect is discussed.
0 Characterization of a third form of the human T cell receptor gamma/delta. A subpopulation of the CD3+ peripheral T lymphocytes express the TCR-gamma/delta complex. Three distinct TCR-gamma forms that differ in size and in the ability to form a disulfide bridge with the TCR-delta subunit have been described. In this study we analyze the structural difference between the non-disulfide-linked 55-kD and 40-kD TCR-gamma chains. The 40-kD TCR-gamma form contains a smaller polypeptide backbone and carries less carbohydrate compared with the 55-kD TCR-gamma form. A cDNA clone corresponding to the 40-kD TCR-gamma subunit lacks one copy of the second exon of the constant region that is present in the other TCR-gamma subunit. This exon copy encodes part of the connector region that is located between the constant domain and the membrane spanning region. We show that the number of potential N-linked glycan attachment sites are the same for the two TCR-gamma forms. Since these attachment sites are located in the connector region we conclude that the connector region influences the amount of N-linked carbohydrates added to the core TCR-gamma polypeptide, probably by affecting the conformation of the protein. In contrast to the TCR-beta constant region usage, the TCR-gamma constant regions are unequally expressed. Virtually exclusive usage of disulfide-linked complexes were found in some individuals, while both the disulfide-linked and the 40-kD, non-disulfide-linked TCR-gamma forms were detected in other subjects. The ability to distinguish these TCR-gamma/delta forms now makes it possible to study the mechanisms that govern their selection and to determine if they correspond to functionally distinct isotypes.
3 Allogeneic tumor rejection induced by the intravenous injection of Lyt-2+ cytolytic T lymphocyte clones. The in vivo activity of murine Lyt-2+ cytolytic T lymphocyte clones was assessed in a tumor allograft model system. Mice that had been sublethally irradiated 16 h previously were injected intraperitoneally with 131I-IUdR-labeled tumor cells. Simultaneously, various doses of four cytolytic T cell clones were injected intravenously and the mice monitored for tumor cell elimination by whole-body counting tecniques. These four clones had been selected on the basis of their ability to proliferate in response to alloantigens in the absence of added T cell growth factor(s). With two of the four clones tested, rapid elimination of tumor cells within the peritoneal cavity was observed, as early as 48 h after intravenous injection of the cloned T cells.
3 Early development of the T cell repertoire. In vivo treatment of neonatal mice with anti-Ia antibodies interferes with differentiation of I-restricted T cells but not K/D-restricted T cells. Monoclonal antibodies to I-Ak were injected into neonatal H-2k mice for a period of 3 wk. The spleens of such mice are devoid of Ia-positive cells. Allo- and trinitrophenyl (TNP)-self-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in such anti-I-A-treated mice were almost completely abrogated at the end of the 2-3 wk in vivo treatment period. Development of suppressor cells, carry-over of blocking antibodies, lack of responder accessory cells, or defective CTL function were not responsible for the observed defect. As concanavalin A supernatant could restore the defect, it is more likely that the defect is due to the absence of competent Ia-specific T helper cells. In addition, anti-I-A-treated mice exhibit reduced I-A antigen expression in the thymus and defective Ia-bearing accessory cell function in the spleen. It is postulated that, for development of Ia-specific T cells to occur, precursor T cells need to interact with Ia-encoded products in the thymus, and anti-Ia treatment interferes with this process. Finally, the mechanism of this interference was shown to be due to actual removal or functional inactivation of those I-A-positive elements responsible for the education of I-A-recognizing T cells, since in (H-2b X H-2k)F1 mice, treatment with anti-I-Ak antibodies results in abrogation of CTL responses to TNP in association with both parental haplotypes, while in the thymus of these mice expression of both I-Ak and I-Ab was reduced.
3 Neuraminidase-treated macrophages stimulate allogenic CD8+ T cells in the presence of exogenous interleukin 2. Prior work has shown that purified, resident, and inflammatory peritoneal macrophages are weak stimulators of the allogeneic MLR. We have identified conditions whereby thioglycollate-elicited macrophages become stimulatory, but primarily for the CD8+ T cell subset. The conditions were to treat the macrophages with neuraminidase and to supplement the MLR with rIL-2. These treatments together led to proliferative and cytotoxic responses by isolated CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells. Likewise when MHC-congenic strains were evaluated, an MLR was observed across isolated class I but not class II MHC barriers. Pretreatment of the macrophages with IFN-gamma further enhanced expression of class I MHC products and stimulatory activity, but did not seem essential. While these treatments did not render macrophages stimulatory for an MLR in purified CD4+ cells, blastogenesis of CD4+ cells was observed when the MLR involved bulk T cells. Small allogeneic B lymphocytes behaved similarly to macrophages, in the pretreatment with neuraminidase and supplementation with rIL-2 rendered B cells stimulatory for allogeneic, enriched, CD8+, but not CD4+, T cells. Spleen adherent cells, which are mixtures of macrophages and dendritic cells, stimulated both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and neither neuraminidase nor exogenous IL-2 was required. We think that these data suggest that most macrophages and small B cells lack three important functions of dendritic cells: a T cell-binding function that can be remedied by neuraminidase treatment, a T cell growth factor-inducing function that can be bypassed with exogenous IL-2, and an IL-2 responsiveness function that is required by CD4+ lymphocytes.
3 Lung injury mediated by antibodies to endothelium. I. In the rabbit a repeated interaction of heterologous anti-angiotensin-converting enzyme antibodies with alveolar endothelium results in resistance to immune injury through antigenic modulation. To study the effects of relatively long-term interaction of antibodies with surface antigens of lung endothelium, rabbits were intravenously injected for a maximum of 4 d with goat anti-rabbit lung angiotensin-converting enzyme (Gt anti-RbACE) antibodies. On day 1 69%, on day 2 13%, and on days 3 and 4 of injection none of the rabbits developed lethal pulmonary edema. By immunofluorescence microscopy, deposits of GtIgG, frequently in association with RbC3, were found along the endothelium of alveolar capillary walls in all rabbits studied on day 1, in 57% on day 2, in 33% on day 3, and in none of them on day 4. While in vitro anti-ACE antibodies bound in a linear pattern to the lung endothelium, the binding pattern in vivo was distinctly granular. The in vivo interaction of antibodies with ACE also redistributed ACE in a granular pattern along capillary walls. In contrast to the granular deposition of injected anti-ACE IgG and F(ab')2 fragments of anti-ACE IgG, Fab fragments of anti-ACE IgG localized, without fixing C3, in a linear pattern along the endothelium of lung capillaries and did not modify the normal distribution of ACE. However, when the injection of Fab fragments of Gt anti-RbACE IgG was followed by an injection of Rb anti-GtIgG serum, granular deposits of Gt Fab fragments, RbIgG and RbC3 were seen along alveolar capillary walls. Biochemical measurement of ACE activity in lung homogenates provided data in agreement with those obtained by immunofluorescence microscopy, showing diminished activity to none on day 4, with some return of ACE activity on day 5, 24 h after the last injection of antibody, and normal values on day 21. The results obtained indicate that divalent antibodies to an antigen expressed on the plasma membrane of rabbit lung endothelial cells promotes a rapid redistribution of antigenic receptors, fixation of complement and, in surviving rabbits, disappearance of the antigen from the endothelial cells that are no longer susceptible to immune injury. In vivo "immunologic enzymectomy" induced by a ligand-surface antigen interaction is an example of antigenic modulation. These events may have an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lesions induced by antibodies reacting with antigens expressed on the plasma membrane of cells in the lung and in other organs.
3 Hyaluronate can function as a cell adhesion molecule and CD44 participates in hyaluronate recognition. A cell adhesion model was previously used to select a series of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which were subsequently found to recognize CD44/Pgp-1. Interest in these reagents increased with the finding that they totally inhibited production of lymphoid or myeloid cells in long-term bone marrow cultures. Further investigation has now revealed that hyaluronate is a potential ligand for CD44 and that hyaluronate recognition accounts for the adhesion between B lineage hybridoma and stromal cells. The hybridoma cells adhered to hyaluronate-coated plastic wells as well as to monolayers of stromal cells. The adhesion in both cases was inhibited by treatment with hyaluronidases, and did not require divalent cations. Addition of exogenous hyaluronate also diminished binding of lymphoid cells to stromal cells. One of several mAbs to Pgp-1/CD44 was particularly effective at blocking these interactions. Since hyaluronate and Pgp-1/CD44 were present on both cell types, experiments were done to determine the cellular location of interacting molecules required for the adhesion process. Treatment of lymphoid cells with an anti-Pgp-1/CD44 antibody was more inhibitory than antibody treatment of the stromal cells. Conversely, hyaluronidase treatment of stromal cells reduced subsequent binding more than treatment of the lymphoid cells. Adhesive interactions that involve hyaluronate and CD44 could contribute to a number of cell recognition processes, including ones required for normal lympho-hemopoiesis.
2 Expression of the Fc-receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RII, CD23) on alveolar macrophages in extrinsic allergic alveolitis. Expression of the Fc receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon R) was analyzed on alveolar macrophages (AM) in 10 patients with extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA) compared with 10 patients with sarcoidosis and to 6 apparently healthy controls. By using the anti-Fc epsilon RII mAb M-L25 in immunocytochemistry experiments, we found that greater than 60% of AM in 10 of 10 patients with EAA were strongly positive, as evidenced by visual analysis in light microscopy and by cytometry. By contrast, no significant staining was detected in sarcoidosis or in controls with either method. Similar results were obtained when Fc epsilon R were identified with preformed immune complexes consisting of NIP-specific human/mouse chimeric IgE antibody plus NIP-ovalbumin. Furthermore, greater than 60% of AM in patients with EAA stained positive for IgE, demonstrating that endogenous IgE is bound to the AM. Our data suggest that IgE antibodies bound to Fc epsilon RII on AM may be involved in pathophysiology of extrinsic allergic alveolitis by activation of the AM after binding of allergen to the cell surface IgE. Furthermore, with the clearcut pattern of Fc epsilon RII expression in extrinsic allergic alveolitis it may be possible to use CD23 antibodies for differential diagnosis of inflammatory lung disease.
2 Synergistic antitumor activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, interleukin 2, and local tumor irradiation. Studies on the mechanism of action. The adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with the concomitant administration of IL-2 has been shown to mediate the regression of established 6- and 14-d murine hepatic and pulmonary metastases. For successful immunotherapy with TIL, however, pretreatment with either cyclophosphamide (CP) or whole body irradiation (WBX) was required. The exact mechanism of CP and WBX augmentation of TIL antitumor activity remains unknown, but the elimination of Ts cells has been frequently invoked as an explanation. To address this possibility and to determine if local tumor irradiation (LTX) could synergize with TIL as well as WBX, we investigated the effect of LTX on the therapeutic efficacy of TIL and IL-2 in the treatment of multiple 7-d murine hepatic metastases. Experiments studying the treatment of a weakly immunogenic murine adenocarcinoma, MC-38, showed prolonged survival of mice treated with the combination of IL-2, TIL, and either LTX or WBX, compared with treatment with radiation alone or radiation plus IL-2 controls (p less than 0.0001). In addition, therapy with LTX and IL-2 prolonged survival, compared with LTX administration alone, whereas therapy with WBX combined with IL-2 did not alter survival. This augmentation of TIL-mediated antitumor activity was dependent on the dose of radiation used. To assess the possibility that tumor-associated Ts cells inhibit the function of adoptively transferred TIL in animals with 7-d metastatic tumor and are eliminated by WBX and LTX, we repeated the above experiments leaving some tumor unirradiated. Mice underwent either LTX or limited LTX, which included only the right side of the liver (LTX1/2). The number of right- and left-sided metastases were then individually counted. These studies showed that the reduction in the number of right-sided metastases was identical between the two groups and that the presence of left-sided tumor in the LTX1/2 group did not suppress the observed antitumor activity of TIL against irradiated tumor. Additional evidence against the elimination of suppressor cells as an important mechanism in radiation-induced augmentation of TIL antitumor activity was provided by experiments studying the effectiveness of TIL in thymectomized, lethally irradiated, and reconstituted B mice. Unless CP was administered before the adoptive transfer of TIL, therapy with IL-2 and TIL in these B mice was ineffective in the absence of demonstrable T lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
2 The antitumor function of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), I. Therapeutic action of TNF against an established murine sarcoma is indirect, immunologically dependent, and limited by severe toxicity. The ability of murine recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) and natural TNF in tumor-necrotizing serum (TNS) to cause regression of the SA1 sarcoma was investigated. We found that to cause regression of a 9-d SA1 sarcoma, near lethal quantities of rTNF and TNS had to be given to the host. However, even at these highly toxic doses, rTNF was not reliable at causing complete tumor regression. On the other hand, both types of TNF were reliable at causing a tumor hemorrhagic reaction that resulted in the destruction of greater than 75% of the tumor's center in 24 h. The TNF-induced hemorrhagic reaction involved the development of numerous petechial hemorrhages in the tumor's vascular bed, which apparently resulted from destruction of the tumor's blood vessels. It was possible to follow the development of the hemorrhagic reaction against time after giving rTNF or TNS by measuring the intratumor extravasation of 51Cr-labeled syngeneic red cells. According to this method, TNF-induced intratumor hemorrhaging was in progress within 1 h of giving TNF and continued for about a 6-h period. However, the hemorrhagic reaction was greatly reduced and complete regression of the rim of the living tumor tissue that survived hemorrhagic necrosis failed to occur, if SA1 sarcoma was growing in T cell-deficient (TXB) mice. This indicates that the TNF-induced hemorrhagic reaction is partly dependent, and the tumor regression that follows is completely dependent on host immunocompetence. This suggests in turn, that rTNF does not directly destroy SA1 tumor cells in vivo, even though it was shown that it can destroy SA1 tumor cells in vitro. This interpretation is supported by the additional findings that rTNF was no more therapeutic against a 3-d (3-mm) SA1 than against a 9-d (8-mm) SA1, and was no more therapeutic when injected directly into the tumor than when injected intravenously. Lastly it was possible to completely inhibit the ability of rTNF and TNS to cause tumor hemorrhagic necrosis and regression by infusing the host with a monospecific, polyvalent anti-rTNF antibody that neutralized the cytotoxic action of rTNF in vitro.
3 Suggested mechanism for the selective excretion of glucosylated albumin. The effects of diabetes mellitus and aging on this process and the origins of diabetic microalbuminuria. In previous studies in the Sprague-Dawley rat, Williams and coworkers reported the phenomenon of selective urinary excretion of glucosylated albumin (editing, i.e., the percent glucosylation of urinary albumin is more than that of plasma albumin) by the mammalian kidney. Ghiggeri and coworkers subsequently found that the extent of editing is reduced in human diabetics. Moreover, the reduction in editing in diabetes correlates inversely with levels of microalbuminuria. We also find reduction in the extent of editing in diabetic humans. We find a striking inverse correlation not only with the magnitude of microalbuminuria but also with the extent of plasma albumin glucosylation. In contrast, we found little correlation between the reduction in editing and the duration of diabetes in human subjects. Stz induced diabetes in the Sprague-Dawley rat is associated with a striking and rapid reduction in editing which develops virtually with the same kinetics exhibited by the appearance of hyperglycemia. This loss of editing is rapidly reversed by daily administration of insulin but not by aldose reductase inhibitors. Mannitol infusion in anesthetized Wistar rats resulted in an increase in urine volume, GFR, and microalbuminuria, and was also accompanied by a marked reduction in editing. This reduction was rapidly reversed by a cessation of mannitol infusion. We propose here that glucosylated albumin (in contrast to unmodified albumin) is not reabsorbed by the proximal tubule, and thus, is preferentially excreted in the urine. We postulate that the increase in GFR which emerges as a consequence of increased plasma osmolality in diabetes mellitus delivers more albumin to the proximal tubule than can be reabsorbed. This results in a dilution of excreted glucosylated albumin molecules by excreted unmodified albumin, which appears as the early microscopic albuminuria of diabetes. Paradoxically, the fall in apparent editing is accompanied by an absolute increase in the total quantity of glucosylated albumin excreted. In contrast, we found that editing of glucosylated albumin by the normal kidney is found to gradually decline as a function of age without the appearance of microalbuminuria. This suggests that a different mechanism operates to produce the loss of editing seen with aging in man, and as clearly (but in a shorter absolute time intervals) in the Fischer-344 rat.
3 Deletion of autospecific T cells in T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice spares cells with normal TCR levels and low levels of CD8 molecules. Transgenic mice that carry on a large fraction of their T cells an alpha/beta T cell receptor that recognizes the male antigen in the context of H-2Db molecules were constructed. An mAb specific for the transgenic receptor was developed and used to analyze T cell subsets in male transgenic H-2b mice. The vast majority of immature CD4+8+ T cells that express the transgenic TCR were deleted in the male transgenic mouse. Nevertheless, the majority of T cells spared by this deletion process expressed a high level of the transgenic TCR. These T cells, however, had an abnormal CD4/CD8 phenotype in that they expressed either no CD8 molecules or only low levels.
3 Accessory and stimulating properties of dendritic cells and macrophages isolated from various rat tissues. Single cell suspensions of rat lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues were fractionated on discontinuous gradients of bovine serum albumin into high density and low density subfractions. In general, accessory activity required for responses of periodate-treated T lymphocytes was recovered only in a low density population containing a small percent of the total fractionated cells from lymph nodes, spleen, liver, skin, and peritoneal exudates. Further purification always led to an increase of both accessory activity and number of dendritic cells present in nonrosetting and nonadherent populations. After purification, a high recovery of the total accessory activity was found in fractions that contained a high percentage of dendritic cells resulting in a more than 1,000-fold enrichment in accessory activity per cell. No other fraction obtained during the purification contained significant accessory activity. In all cases, macrophage-enriched populations lacked accessory cell activity. With the exception of peritoneal exudate cell preparations, which contained an inhibitory cell, the level of accessory activity in a given population was always found to be a function of the number of dendritic cells present. Dendritic cells from all sources were nonadherent, nonphagocytic, radio- resistant, and nonspecific esterase negative. They expressed Ia antigens and lacked Fc receptors. Both epidermal and lymph node dendritic cells contain Birbeck granules, subcellular structures previously described only for Langerhans cells. Accessory activity requires viable dendritic cells but is unaffected by 1,000 rad of gamma-irradiation. However, ultraviolet irradiation abolished the activity of accessory cells. The cells that responded to periodate were IgG-negative T cells, whereas IgG-positive B cells could not be stimulated under the same conditions. Only periodate-treated T cells and dendritic cells were needed for responses to occur; removal of virtually all macrophages from these purified preparations had no effect. Dendritic cells were also required as stimulators in mixed leukocyte cultures, whereas macrophages, even though Ia positive, were inert.
3 H-2 compatibility is required for T-cell-mediated lysis of target cells infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Maximal cell-mediated lysis of targets infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus occurs only within a H-2 compatible system. Syngeneic immune spleen cells are at least 100 times as effective as are allogeneic lymphocytes. Reciprocal restriction of cytotoxic T-cell activity has been shown to operative between H-2k, H-2d, and H-2b. Experiments with cogenic mice have localized the effect to the H-2 gene complex. Furthermore, the observation that lymphocytes from H-2a mice cause high specific 51Cr release from either H-2d virus-infected cells, indicates that identity at either the K or the D end of the H-2 gene complex is sufficient for this lytic interaction.
2 Variable capacity of L3T4+ T cells to cause lethal graft-versus-host disease across minor histocompatibility barriers in mice. Highly purified populations of L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ T cell subsets were compared for their capacity to cause lethal GVHD in six different H-2-compatible, multiple minor histocompatibility antigen-different murine strain combinations. In four of these combinations (C3H.SW----B6, DBA/2----B10.D2, B10.BR----CBA, and B10.S----SJL), lethal GVHD appeared to be caused almost entirely by Lyt-2+ cells; the injection of L3T4+ cells resulted in low mortality even when these cells were presensitized to the recipient antigens. In the remaining two combinations (B10.D2----DBA/2 and B10.D2----BALB/c), L3T4+ T cells were able to cause a high incidence of GVHD and were more potent than the Lyt-2+ cells. The implications of these findings are discussed.
3 Self H-2 antigens influence the specificity of alloreactive cells. We have tested Jerne's hypothesis (9) that the phenomenon alloreactivity is explained by the existence of T cells that express germline-encoded receptors specific for major histocompatibility complex antigens and that these cells undergo no change in specificity during thymic differentiation. T cells from [F1 leads to Parent] bone marrow radiation chimeras reactive to conventional antigens are known to have a self preference, i.e., [A X B leads to A] chimeras respond better to H-2A-plus-antigen than to H-2B-plus-antigen. We show here that alloreactive cells from such chimeras also have a self preference. Thus, H-2k-specific alloreactive T cells from [H-2b X H-2d leads to H-2b] and [H-2b X H-2d leads to H-2d] chimeras cross-react more on TNP-modified H-2b or H-2d targets, respectively. In contrast to Jerne's prediction, the results suggest that the receptor repertoire of alloreactive F1 cells is influenced by H-2 antigens on radiation-resistant cells present during T cell ontogeny. By this criterion of having a self preference in H-2 restriction, alloreactive T cells appear to be similar to T cells that respond to conventional antigens.
3 The action of leucyl-leucine methyl ester on cytotoxic lymphocytes requires uptake by a novel dipeptide-specific facilitated transport system and dipeptidyl peptidase I-mediated conversion to membranolytic products. The mechanism of toxicity for cytolytic lymphocytes of Leu-Leu-OMe and related dipeptide derivatives was examined. Selective inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI), a lysosomal thiol protease highly enriched in cytotoxic lymphocytes, prevented all natural killer (NK) toxic effects of such agents. However, many DPPI substrates were found to possess no NK toxic properties. For some such agents, this lack of NK toxicity appeared to be related to the lack of uptake by lymphocytes. In this regard, Leu-Leu-OMe was found to be incorporated by lymphocytes and monocytes via a saturable facilitated transport mechanism with characteristics distinct from previously characterized mammalian dipeptide transport processes. This novel transport process was found to be specific for dipeptides composed of selective L-stereoisomer amino acids and enhanced by hydrophobic ester or amide additions to the COOH terminus of dipeptides. Maximal rates of Leu-Leu-OMe uptake by T8 and NK cell-enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were four- to sixfold higher than for T4-enriched PBL or PBL depleted of Leu-Leu-OMe-sensitive cytotoxic lymphocytes. All dipeptide amides or esters with NK toxic properties were found to act as competitive inhibitors of [3H]Leu-Leu-OMe uptake by PBL. However, some NK nontoxic DPPI substrates were found to be comparable with Leu-Leu-OMe in avidity for this transport process. Such agents were noted to possess one or more hydrophilic amino acid side chains and were found not to mediate red blood cell lysis when subjected to the acyl transferase activity of DPPI. Thus, uptake by a dipeptide-specific facilitated transport mechanism and conversion by DPPI to hydrophobic polymerization products with membranolytic properties were found to be common features of NK toxic dipeptide derivatives. The presence of a previously unreported dipeptide transport mechanism within blood leukocytes and the selective enrichment of the granule enzyme, DPPI, within cytotoxic effector cells of lymphoid or myeloid lineage appear to afford a unique mechanism for the targeting of immunotherapeutic reagents composed of simple dipeptide esters or amides.
1 Antibody activity in ankylosing spondylitis sera to two sites on HLA B27.1 at the MHC groove region (within sequence 65-85), and to a Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase reductase peptide (within sequence 181-199). 74 overlapping peptides of varying lengths from Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase reductase (residues 181-199) and from the HLA B27.1 molecule (residues 65-85) were synthesized and tested by ELISA against sera from HLA B27+ ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients, and sera from HLA B27+ and HLA B27- healthy first-degree relatives. Antibody activity in AS sera to Klebsiella peptides of four to eight amino acids was maximal with the peptide NSRQTDR. Activity to HLA B27 peptides was maximal with the peptide KAKAQTDR (named epitope I). These peptides overlap with, but are proximal to the NH2 terminus from QTDRED, which is homologous in HLA B27.1 and K. pneumoniae nitrogenase reductase. A second weaker reactive site was noted in the HLA B27.1 peptides, proximal to the COOH terminus from the homologous sequence, namely peptide REDLRTLL (named epitope II). Little activity was seen against peptides that included the entire homologous sequence. Sera from 50 AS patients showed higher total Ig activity against peptides KAKAQTDR (p less than 0.001) and NSRQTDR (p less than 0.02) than did sera from 22 B27+ and 22 B27- healthy controls. These data indicate that AS patient sera contain antibodies that bind to K. pneumoniae nitrogenase peptides and HLA B27.1 peptides, and that there are at least two epitopes on HLA B27.1 in the alpha 1 domain, at the MHC groove region, that are autoantigenic in AS patients. Epitope I may be a site for crossreactivity between HLA B27 and Klebsiella.
3 Synergistic genetic defect in B-lymphocyte function. I. Defective responses to B-cell stimulants and their genetic basis. CBA/N female mice, which express an X-linked defect in B-lymphocyte function, were mated with C3H/HeJ male mice, which are unresponsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The resulting F1 hybrid females were mated to C3H/HeJ males. Approximately one-half of the backcross (BC.1) males obtained from this mating expressed a more profound immunologic defect than either of the parental strains. Spleen cells from these mice were unresponsive to a series of B-cell mitogens including LPS prepared from Escherichia coli K235 and from E. coli 0111:B4, lipoprotein mitogen from E. coli, and Nocardia water-soluble mitogen (NWSM). They failed to give in vitro antibody responses to the thymus-independent type 2 (TI-2) antigen trinophenylated Ficoll and most were unresponsive to the TI-1 antigens trinitrophenylated Brucella abortus, trinitrophenylated LPS, and trinitrophenylated NWSM. This synergistic defect in B-lymphocyte function depended on the presence of the CBA/N xid gene but the critical gene(s) from the C3H strain was not the defective Lps gene (Lpsd). These mice should provide a valuable tool for the elucidation of B-lymphocyte ontogeny, heterogeneity, and function.
3 Seeding of thymic microenvironments defined by distinct thymocyte-stromal cell interactions is developmentally controlled. Seeding of distinct intrathymic microenvironments defined by direct thymocyte-stromal cell interactions was correlated with T cell development in situ using radiation and nonradiation chimeras of Thy-1.1/1.2 congenic mice. The results identify associations of thymocytes with I-A- macrophages in the cortex as the earliest discernible cell-cell interactions during thymopoiesis. After a significant delay, this recognition stage is followed by concomitant interactions of T cells with I-A+ epithelial cells in the cortex and bone marrow-derived I-A+ dendritic cells in the medulla. All three types of T cell-stromal cell interactions occur after seeding of the intrathymic precursor cell subset and before development of mature medullary-type T cells. The seeding kinetics imply that recognition of cortical epithelial cells by thymocytes in situ represents a relatively late stage of cortical T cell development, whereas thymocyte-dendritic cell interactions denote a very early stage of T cell development in the medulla. The relative positioning of these cell-cell recognition stages during the course of T cell maturation pertains to a putative role of these microenvironments in selection and tolerization of the T cell repertoire.
3 The influence of intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides on cell proliferation and the induction of antibody synthesis. The intracellular ratio of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) to guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) may control the developmental pathway followed by antibody-forming cell (AFC) precursors. The evidence for this is derived from several different types of experiments. First lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which is mitogenic for B lymphocytes, stimulates rapid, transient changes in intracellular levels of cyclic GMP but not cyclic AMP when added to mouse spleen cultures. Cyclic GMP itself stimulates DNA synthesis in these cultures, suggesting that the intracellular changes in cyclic GMP levels are involved in the mitogenic signal delivered by LPS to cells. The absolute amounts of cyclic nucleotides may vary widely in different cells under various conditions, however, the intracellular ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP is always high in nondividing cells and low in dividing cells. AFC precursors appear to respond to antigen in the absence of T-cell activity by inactivation (1-7). In the response to antigen in the presence of specific T cells, precursor cells proliferate and mature to AFC. Raising intracellular levels of cyclic AMP inhibits cell proliferation and leads to precursor cell inactivation (14, 15). It is suggested that the interaction of antigen with immunoglobulin receptors on the surface of precursors cells leads to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity and initiates the inactivation pathway. Since cyclic GMP stimulates immune responses in T-cell-depleted cultures (14, 15) and increasing cyclic GMP levels appear to be involved in the delivery of a mitogenic signal to cells, it is suggested that T-helper cells deliver a signal to precursor cells via the stimulation of guanylate cyclase to initiate the inductive pathway. It is suggested that it is the intracellular ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP that regulates the fate of precursor cells, not the absolute level of one cyclic nucleotide.
0 Regulation of T cell autocrine growth. T4+ cells become refractory to interleukin 2. During the course of investigating the regulation of IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation, we found that the subset of human T cells expressing the T4 surface glycoprotein become refractory to IL-2 growth promotion earlier than T8+ cells. Since T4+ cells proliferate in an autocrine fashion to endogenous IL-2, whereas most T8+ cells respond in a paracrine fashion to IL-2 derived from T4+ cells, we thought it likely that a unique mechanism was operative to restrict T4+ cell IL-2-dependent autocrine proliferation. Moreover, we anticipated that the T4+ cell IL-2-refractory state related either to suppression by T8+ cells, or to expression of T4+ cell IL-2-R. However, several experimental approaches did not support either of these mechanisms as being responsible for the loss of T4+ cell IL-2 responsiveness. Isolated T4+ cells ceased to respond to IL-2 well before T8+ cells, and before the disappearance of adequate levels of IL-2-R. Moreover, a detailed comparison of IL-2-R expression by T4+ vs. T8+ cells revealed no differences in the number, affinity, rate of expression, or functional activity of high-affinity IL-2-R expressed by the two subsets. Accordingly, T4+ cell autocrine IL-2 responsiveness is restricted by a mechanism that is independent of IL-2-R, and which ultimately results in cessation of both T4+ and T8+ cell IL-2-dependent clonal expansion.
3 Double isotype production by a neoplastic B cell line. I. Cellular and biochemical characterization of a variant of BCL1 that expresses and secretes both IgM and IgG1. We have subcloned the in vitro-adapted murine B cell leukemia, BCL1.B1, to obtain a variant that expresses both IgM and IgG1. By fluorescence analysis, radioiodination, and immunoprecipitation of cell surface Ig, and by RIA of medium from limiting dilution cultures, we have shown that: (a) all the cells express and secrete both isotypes. The heavy chains of both IgG1 and IgM have the apparent molecular weights of membrane mu and gamma 1 chains; (b) both isotypes bear the same idiotype as determined by immunoprecipitation with antiidiotypic antibody, and both use the same VDJ rearrangement as shown by Southern blotting; and (c) the cells express the membrane and secreted forms of mRNA for both mu and gamma 1 but not gamma 2b or gamma 3. Taken together, the data suggest that all the cells are synthesizing, expressing on their surface, and secreting two isotypes that use the same VDJ rearrangement in the DNA and express the same serologically-defined idiotype. The molecular basis responsible for the production of the two isotypes in a single cell is the subject of the accompanying paper.
3 A variant of prealbumin from amyloid fibrils in familial polyneuropathy of Jewish origin. Amyloid fibrils were isolated from spleen and thyroid obtained at autopsy from one patient (S.K.O.) of Jewish origin with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. Gel filtration on Sephadex G100 after solubilization in 5 M guanidine HCl yielded three major components with 14,000, 9,000, and 5,000 mol wt, respectively. The two larger components shared antigenic determinants with human prealbumin. Amino acid analysis and amino terminal sequence studies revealed the 14,000-mol wt protein to be an intact prealbumin subunit. The 9,000-mol wt fragment obtained in highest yield encompassed the region from position 49-127 and the 5,000 mol wt fraction encompassed the amino terminal of prealbumin (position 1-48). An amino acid substitution (Gly/Thr) was detected at position 49, where enzymatic cleavage occurred. Thus, several prealbumin-derived fragments, predominantly the carboxyl end, constitute the amyloid fibrils in a heredofamilial amyloidosis syndrome of dominant inheritance.
1 Impact of a programme of mass mammography screening for breast cancer on socio-economic variation in survival: a population-based study. After a systematic mass mammography breast cancer screening programme was implemented between 1991 and 1996 (attendance 80%), we evaluated its impact on survival according to socioeconomic status (SES). We studied survival rates up to 1-1-2005 for all consecutive breast cancer patients aged 50-69 and diagnosed in the period 1983-2002 in the area of the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (n = 4939). Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox regression analysis. The proportion of breast cancer patients with a low SES decreased from 22% in 1983-1990 to 14% in 1997-2002 when attendance was 85%. The proportion of newly diagnosed patients with stage III or IV disease in 1997-2002 was only 10% compared to 14% in 1991-1996 and 26% in 1983-1989 (P < 0.0001). Stage distribution improved for all socio-economic groups (P = 0.01). Survival was similar for all socio-economic groups in 1983-1990, but after the introduction of the screening programme women with low SES had lower age- and stage-adjusted survival rates (HR 2.0, 95%CI: 1.3-3.0). Survival was better for patients diagnosed in 1997-2002 compared to 1983-1990 for all socioeconomic strata; it was substantially better for the high SES group (HR 0.36, 0.2-0.5) compared to the lowest SES (HR 0.77, 0.6-1.1). Although survival improved for women from each of the socio-economic strata, related to the high participation rate of the screening programme, women from lower socio-economic strata clearly benefited less from the breast cancer screening programme. That is also related to the higher prevalence of comorbidity and possibly suboptimal treatment.
3 T helper cells recognize an idiotope located on peptide 88-114/117 of the light chain variable domain of an isologous myeloma protein (315). Isolated variable region light chain 315 (VL-315), the VL domain of a myeloma protein of BALB/c origin, induces T cells of BALB/c (H-2d) mice that help the adoptive secondary anti-4-hydroxy-3-iodo-5-nitrophenylacetyl (NIP) antibody response to NIP-Fab315. The location of the epitope recognized by helper cells was examined with two fragments of VL-315, obtained by cleavage with cyanogen bromide at Met 87. Both N-terminal fragment 1-86 and C-terminal fragment 88-114/117 elicited BALB/c antibodies that bound to the respective fragments and to VL-315. By contrast, only fragment 88-114/117, which consists of the third hypervariable region, J region, and 5-7 amino acids of the C region, induced helper cells that augmented the anti-NIP response to NIP-Fab 315.
3 Two loci affecting B cell responses to B cell maturation factors. B lymphocytes from DBA/2Ha mice have a genetic defect characterized by a failure to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells in response to a family of lymphokines termed B cell maturation factors (BMFs). By contrast, B cells from DBA/2Ha mice respond normally in PFC assays to the B cell mitogen LPS, and macrophages from these mice are activated by one of the three BMFs. Two loci are responsible for the B cell defect in DBA/2Ha mice. One locus (Bmfr-1) is constitutively expressed throughout life, and maps approximately 13 cM distal to the brown locus on chromosome 4. A second locus (Bmfr-2) becomes active only after sexual maturity and is closely linked to the dilute locus on chromosome 9. At both loci, alleles determining responsiveness to BMFs are dominant over nonresponder alleles. The effect of Bmfr-2 on B cell responsiveness may be related to levels of the steroid sex hormones. DBA/2Ha mice offer a tool for studying the genetic and hormonal regulation of the immune system.
3 Aspergillus fumigatus allergen I, a major IgE-binding protein, is a member of the mitogillin family of cytotoxins. A major 18-kD IgE-binding protein from Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp fI) has been purified. Partial amino acid sequencing of Asp f I showed extensive sequence homology (95%) between Asp fI and a cytotoxin (mitogillin) produced by A. restrictus. Crossinhibition radioimmunoassay using murine monoclonal antibody and human IgG and IgE antibodies showed that Asp fI and mitogillin were antigenically indistinguishable. Furthermore, both proteins inhibited protein synthesis in vitro by greater than 90%. Asp fI was expressed in A. fumigatus but not in seven other Aspergillus species. The results suggest that Asp fI could play a dual role in the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus-related diseases by promoting colonization through cytotoxic activity and by causing inflammatory reactions involving IgE antibodies.
3 Separation of antigen-specific lymphocytes. I. Enrichment of antigen-binding cells. Normal mouse spleen cells were fractionated in dishes coated with thin layers of DNP-gelatin or NIP-gelatin, which were insoluble at 4 degrees C. Highly viable cells were recovered from the dishes by melting the gel at 37 degrees C. NIP3- gelatin layers bound approximately 0.1% and DNP4-gelatin layers 0.5% of normal spleen cells. Increasing numbers of low affinity cells were bound with increasing DNP density of the adsorbent. The binding to insoluble DNP-gelatin was hapten-specific since it was inhibited by DNP-lysine, soluble DNP-gelatin or DNP-BSA but not by soluble gelatin or bovine serum albumin (BSA). It was also inhibited by a polyvalent rabbit antimouse Ig. DNP-gelatin was detected on the surface of cells recovered from DNP-gelatin-coated dishes by 125-I-labeled anti-DNP Ig. The cell surface bound DNP-gelatin could be removed by treatment with collagenase. Collagenase treatment did not detectably affect cell viability or surface receptors. More than 90% of DNP-gelatin binding cells were labeled with a polyvalent 125-I-labeled antimouse Ig before or after collagenase treatment under conditions known to label B lymphocytes. Furthermore, the specific antigen-binding capacity of the purified cell populations could be demonstrated after treatment with collagenase. Purified DNP4-gelatin binding cells contained more than 100 times as many DNP-RFC than unfractionated cells. The enrichment of NIP-RFC in the cell population recovered from NIP3 gelatin-coated dishes was more than 200-fold.
2 Suppression of T cells specific for the nonthymic parental H-2 haplotype in thymus-grafted chimeras. The mechanism of restriction of T-cell specificity by the genotype of the thymus in allogeneic and semiallogeneic chimeras was investigated. Lack of induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) directed against antigen in association with the nonthymic parental haplotype in naive cells adoptively transferred into chimeras suggests the existence of an in vivo suppressive mechanism. However, it was not possible to suppress the expression of DTH in sensitized cells transferred into chimeras, or to transfer this suppression to normal naive recipients.
3 H-2-controlled suppression of T cell response to lactate dehydrogenase B. Characterization of the lactate dehydrogenase B suppressor pathway. We characterized the cell types involved in the H-2-controlled suppression of T cell response to lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB). The suppressor effector (Tse) was found to be an Lyt-1+2+, J+ cell that recognizes antigen together with Ek molecules of antigen-presenting cells (APC). To become functional, the Tse cell requires a second signal from a nonspecific, Lyt-1+2-, J+ suppressor-inducer (Tsi) cell. The Tsi-Tse interaction is not subject to any genetic restriction. The target cell of suppression is an Lyt-1+2-, J- (most likely T helper [Th]) cell that recognizes LDHB in the context of A molecules on APC. The suppression is manifested in inhibition of the antigen-specific, A-restricted proliferation of Th cells. The interaction between Tse and Th is restricted by the A region of the H-2 complex. Because this restriction is determined by the receptor of Th cells, the mechanism of Th-Tse interaction most likely involves a concomitant recognition of LDHB and A region-controlled molecules by Th cells on the surface of Tse cells.
3 Antigen-reactive T cell clones restricted by mixed isotype A beta d/E alpha d class II molecules. Mixed isotype A beta dE alpha d class II molecule-restricted antigen-reactive T cell clones were obtained from (BALB/c x B6E alpha d)F1 mice. These T cell clones responded to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in the presence of (BALB/c x B6E alpha d)F1 but not CBF1 APCs. Both anti-A beta d and anti-E alpha mAbs blocked the proliferative responses of these clones. The frequency of such mixed isotype A beta E alpha-restricted T cell clones in (BALB/c x B6E alpha d)F1 mice was estimated to be approximately 10% from our limiting dilution cloning. The existence of such mixed isotype class II molecule-restricted T cells would have important implications for the expansion of the T cell repertoire as well as the induction of autoimmunity.
3 T cell-derived B cell growth and differentiation factors. Dichotomy between the responsiveness of B cells from adult and neonatal mice. In these studies we have determined the molecular weights of B cell growth factor (BCGF) (less than 20,000), and B cell differentiation factors (BCDF) that induce immunoglobulin M (IgM) secretion (BCDF mu) (30-60,000) and IgG secretion (BCDF gamma) (less than 20,000). Thus, the molecular weight of BCDF mu is distinct from that of BCGF and BCDF gamma; BCGF and BCDF gamma cannot be distinguished. In addition, BCGF, BCDF mu, and BCDF gamma are distinguishable by their presence or absence in different supernatants from a panel of mitogen-induced T cell clones. These results suggest that the three lymphokines are different. This conclusion is supported by their differential biological effect on B cells from adult and neonatal mice. Thus, treatment with anti-Ig induces B cells from adult mice to proliferate and this proliferation is sustained by BCGF. In contrast, even in the presence of BCGF, anti-Ig does not induce B cells from neonatal mice to proliferate. However, BCDF mu and BCDF gamma induce IgM and IgG secretion in B cells, respectively, from both adult and neonatal mice. Thus, mature B cells can both clonally expand and differentiate in response to anti-Ig, BCGF, and BCDF, whereas immature B cells can only differentiate. The poor response of neonatal B cells to anti-Ig and BCGF may partially explain the relative immunoincompetence of immature B cells.
3 Antigen recognition by human T cell receptor gamma-positive lymphocytes. Specific lysis of allogeneic cells after activation in mixed lymphocyte culture. These experiments were designed to define the ability of human TCR-gamma+ cells to recognize allogeneic cells. TCR-gamma+-enriched populations were obtained by treating peripheral blood E-rosetting cells with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAbs. The resulting populations were CD2+4-8- expressed variable proportions of CD3+ cells (40-90%), and did not react with the WT31 mAb, which is specific for a framework determinant of the alpha/beta heterodimer that serves as receptor for antigen on most human T lymphocytes. After mixed lymphocyte culture with irradiated allogeneic cells for 7 d and 3 additional days in rIL-2 (100 U/ml), cells underwent proliferation in three of five individuals tested. In addition, MLC-derived cells lysed 51Cr-labeled PHA-induced blasts derived from the allogeneic cells used as stimulator, but not allogeneic unrelated or autologous blast cells. No cytotoxicity against autologous or allogeneic target cells could be induced by culturing CD3+4-8-WT31- lymphocytes in MLC with irradiated autologous cells. Surface iodination of allogeneic MLC-activated CD3+4-8-WT31- cells followed by lysis in 1% digitonin and immunoprecipitation with anti-CD3 mAb indicated that the CD3-associated molecules consisted of a major 45-kD band and a minor band of 43 kD. Northern blot analysis showed that mRNA for the gamma chain was expressed at high levels, whereas mRNAs for alpha and beta chains were missing. These data support the notion that TCR-gamma rather than TCR-alpha/beta is expressed in allospecific CD3-4-8-WT31- cell populations. Clones were further derived from MLC-stimulated CD3+4-8-WT31- populations. All the seven clones studied in detail maintained the surface phenotype as well as the cytolytic pattern of the original MLC populations, thus only specific allogeneic PHA-induced blasts were lysed. NK-sensitive as well as NK-resistant tumor targets were variably susceptible to lysis; therefore, specific cytolytic activity against allogeneic cells was not necessarily linked to the expression of MHC-nonrestricted cytotoxicity against tumor cells.
2 Interleukin 3 perfusion in W/Wv mice allows the development of macroscopic hematopoietic spleen colonies and restores cutaneous mast cell number. The genetically anemic W/Wv mice are characterized by the inability of their bone marrow cells to form macroscopic pluripotent hematopoietic colonies in the spleen of irradiated recipients upon transfer (colony-forming units). Furthermore, they almost totally lack mast cells, notably in the skin. In the present study, we have tested the effect of recombinant murine interleukin 3 (rmIL-3) on W/Wv mice hematopoiesis. Transfer of W/Wv bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipients perfused with rmIL-3 is followed by the appearance of macroscopic spleen colonies. Moreover, perfusion of rmIL-3 in W/Wv mice: (a) restores almost normal total numbers of hematopoietic precursors (colony-forming cells), but without modification of anemia; and (b) leads to the appearance of a normal number of mastocytes in the skin.
0 Angioedema induced by a peptide derived from complement component C2. Synthetic peptides that correspond to the COOH-terminal portion of C2b enhance vascular permeability in human and guinea pig skin. In human studies, 1 nmol of the most active peptide of 25-amino acid residues produced substantial local edema. A pentapeptide and a heptapeptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal sequence of C2b each induced contraction of estrous rat uterus in the micromole range; a peptide of 25 amino acids from this region induced a like contraction of rat uterus at a concentration 20-fold lower than the smaller peptides. The vascular permeability of guinea pig skin was enhanced by doses of these synthetic peptides in a similar fashion as that observed for the concentration of rat uterus. The induction of localized edema by intradermal injection in both the guinea pig and the human proceeds in the presence of antihistaminic drugs, suggesting that there is a histamine-independent component to the observed increase in vascular permeability. Cleavage of C2 with the enzymic subcomponent of C1, C1s, yields only C2a and C2b, and no small peptides, whereas cleavage of C2 with C1s and plasmin yields a set of small peptides. These plasmin-cleaved peptides are derived from the COOH terminus of C2b, and they induce the contraction of estrous rat uterus.
3 Isolation and characterization of a distinct immunoregulatory isoform of alpha-fetoprotein produced by the normal fetus. In this report, we examine the functional significance of the molecular microheterogeneity of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). In doing so, we have taken the direct approach of purifying the naturally occurring isomeric forms of fetal-derived AFP using a preparative anion exchange column linked to an automated fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system followed by parallel testing of each isolated molecular variant for in vitro immunoregulatory activity. The data obtained demonstrate the presence of seven distinct variants of AFP as defined by their retention volumes on FPLC elution profiles, by their pIs on analytical IEF gels, and by Western blot analysis. Molecular mass determination by SDS-PAGE showed each isomer to be equivalent in size to 69,000-dalton native unfractionated AFP molecules. All the immunosuppressive activity of AFP was localized to a single variant representing only 6% of the total composition of native AFP. The immunoregulating isomer termed AFP-1 was the least acidic of the seven isolated variants with a pI of 5.1 and displayed a sialic acid content of 1 mol/mol of protein. The inhibitory activity of AFP-1 could be readily measured on T cell-dependent antibody synthesis, Con A-induced stimulation of Lyt-1+23- thymocyte DNA synthesis, and lymphokine-activated NK cell activity. All other isomers were without effect in these test systems. The immunosuppressive AFP-1 isomer also displayed the strongest growth-promoting influence on cultured bone marrow lymphocytes. There was no correlation between functional activity and degree of expression of sialic acid residues on the AFP molecules. These findings demonstrate that the immunoregulating function of AFP is confined to a distinct and relatively small subpopulation of native AFP molecules and should therefore contribute to the resolution of outstanding questions regarding the structure/function relationship of this onco-fetal glycoprotein.
0 High-affinity receptor-mediated internalization and degradation of interleukin 2 in human T cells. Receptor-mediated internalization and degradation of IL-2 were investigated in cell lines carrying human T cell leukemia/lymphoma (lymphotrophic) virus type I (HTLV-I) and PHA-treated normal PBL. The HTLV-I-carrying cell lines ILT-Yan and TL-Mor, and the PBL expressed both high- and low-affinity IL-2-R. However, another HTLV-I-carrying T cell line, MT-1, expressed mainly low-affinity receptors. Greater than 50% of the IL-2 bound to high-affinity receptors was internalized within 10 min when these cells were incubated at 37 degrees C. The internalized IL-2 was rapidly degraded and the products were excreted into the culture fluid. The t1/2 of IL-2 degradation in these cells was estimated as 60-80 min at 37 degrees C. The internalization and degradation of IL-2 were both temperature dependent. Light-microscopic autoradiography with 3H-labeled IL-2 confirmed the internalization of IL-2, and suggested that some IL-2 might be carried to the nucleus.
2 Distribution of mast-cell precursors in hematopoeitic and lymphopoietic tissues of mice. Two experimental systems were used to investigate the origin of precursor cells which differentiate into tissue mast cells in vivo. (a) Increase of mast cell number was examined in the skin, stomach, cecum, and mesentery of genetically mast cell-depleted WBB6F1 (WB X C57BL/6)-W/WV mice after the injection of various hematolymphoid cells of congenic +/+ mice. (b) Appearance of mast cells with giant granules was studied in irradiated C57BL/6-+/+ mice after the injection of lymphoid cells of C57BL/6-bgJ/bgJ (beige, Chediak-Higashi syndrome) mice. Concentrations of mast cell precursors in the thymus, lymph node and Peyer's patch were less than 0.1% of the concentration in the bone marrow. Neither treatment of donor bone marrow cells with anti-Thy-1.2 serum and complement nor thymectomy of the recipient mice affects the development of mast cells in the skin, stomach, cecum, and mesentery. Moreover, the number of mast cells increased to normal level when the skin of WBB6F1-W/WV mice was grafted on the back of nude athymic (BALB/c-nu/nu) mice. These results indicate that mast cell precursors are derived from hematopoietic tissues rather than lymphopoetic ones and that the differentiation of the precursor cells does not depend on T lymphocytes or the thymus.
3 Precursors of T cell growth factor producing cells in the thymus: ontogeny, frequency, and quantitative recovery in a subpopulation of phenotypically mature thymocytes defined by monoclonal antibody GK-1.5. In this report, the ontogeny of precursors of T cell growth factor (TCGF)-producing cells in the mouse thymus was investigated using a recently described limiting dilution microculture system. In agreement with previous studies, in the adult thymus TCGF production by cells stimulated by alloantigens was largely the property of the Lyt-2-negative subpopulation. Furthermore, when Lyt-2-negative cells were stained with monoclonal antibody GK-1.5 and sorted according to fluorescence intensity, all precursors of TCGF-producing cells were quantitatively recovered in the GK-1.5-positive subpopulation. During ontogeny, TCGF production by Lyt-2-negative thymocytes was first detectable on the 19th day of embryonic development at which time the precursor frequency was 1/10th that found in the adult thymus. As in the adult thymus, all precursors of TCGF-producing cells had the GK-1.5-positive, Lyt-2-negative phenotype. In parallel to these functional studies, the ontogeny of GK-1.5+, Lyt-2- cells was investigated. In the adult thymus, 80% of cells expressed both GK-1.5 and Lyt-2 antigens, whereas minor subpopulations of 10% and 5% (corresponding to phenotypically mature thymocytes as defined by cortisone-resistant thymocytes [CRT]) expressed GK-1.5 or Lyt-2 exclusively; 3% of cells expressed neither antigen. During ontogeny, thymocytes expressing both GK-1.5 and Lyt-2 first appeared on the 16th day of embryonic development and their proportion increased rapidly thereafter. Interestingly, the GK-1.5+, Lyt-2- subpopulation first appeared in significant numbers on day 19 in parallel with the appearance of functional TCGF activity. Taken together with our previous studies correlating cytolytic T lymphocyte precursor (CTL-P) activity with the Lyt-2+, GK-1.5- subpopulation, these results further emphasize the strict correlation between functional activity and mature surface phenotype of both embryonic and adult thymocytes.
1 Immunologic studies on the influenza A virus nonstructural protein NS1. We purified the major influenza virus nonstructural protein, designated NS1, from cytoplasmic inclusions that were solubilized and used to raise antisera in rabbits. One of the antisera was found to be specific for NS1 by complement fixation tests and analyses of immune precipitates. Antiserum to NS1 isolated from cells infected with A/WSN/33 virus specifically precipitated NS1 from extracts of cells infected with seven distinct isolates of influenza A virus representing five different antigenic subtypes. These included A/WSN/33, A/PR/8/34, A/FW/5/50, A/USSR/90/77, A/RI/5+/57, A/Victoria/3/75, and A/Swine /1977/31; however, NS1 from cells infected with B/Lee/40 virus was not precipitated. Radioimmunoassays using radioiodinated NS1 protein from A/WSN virus-infected cells and unlabeled cytoplasmic extracts of cells infected with various strains of influenza virus as competitors indicated significant antigenic cross-reactivities for the NS1 proteins of all influenza A viruses tested. The results suggest a gradual antigenic drift over the 45 yr separating the earliest and most recent virus isolates examined. Thus, compared with the virion neuraminidase and hemagglutinin antigens, NS1 appears to be highly conserved in different influenza A virus isolates.
3 Idiotype profile of an immune response. I. Contrasts in idiotypic dominance between primary and secondary responses and between IgM and IgG plaque-forming cells. The primary response of A/J mice to p-azobenzenearsonate-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (ABA-KLH) was investigated. A day-by-day analysis at the plaque- forming cell (PFC) level was performed, with inhibition by anti-cross- reactive idiotype (CRI) serum to determine percentage of CRI(+) PFC. A regular pattern in the dynamics of Id (idiotype) dominance was observed. Just as in the NP-b and NP-a systems (9, 12), the major Id (CRI) is more dominant in primary than in secondary or hyperimmune responses. This trend is more apparent in IgG PFC which are generally 80-95 percent CRI(+) at day 10 in the primary response but only 30-40 percent CRI(+) at day 10 in secondary or hyperimmune responses. A somewhat different pattern is seen with IgM PFC. These may reach a peak of 85 percent CRI(+) in the primary response, but secondary or hyperimmune IgM PFC, which are lower in numbers than IgG PFC, remain high in CRI content at approximately 70 percent. The PFC data on extent of id dominance in secondary or hyperimmune responses is fully compatible with previously reported serological data by others. Analysis of IgG PFC by hapten inhibition indicated that heterogeneity was in the order secondary PFC {greater than} primary PFC {greater than} hybridoma AK-2.2 PFC with H(75)/H(25) values of 22.9, 6.2, and 2.7, respectively; where H(75) and H(25) are the hapten concentrations required to give 75 percent and 25 percent of inhibition of PFC, respectively. Hapten inhibition data also suggested that secondary IgG PFC were 10 times higher in median binding avidity for ABA-L-tyrosine than primary IgG PFC. The kinetic analysis strongly indicated that CRI(+) IgM PFC were preferentially switched to IgG PFC in the primary response. In both studies, the CRI content of the earliest-appearing IgG PFC was significantly higher than that of IgM PFC on that day. For example, in one case IgM PFC were 60 percent CRI + on day 6 whereas IgG PFC were 100 percent CRI(+). The high Id dominance and selective isotype switching may have either a B or a T cell basis.
3 Mitogen-initiated synthesis and secretion of T cell growth factor(s) by a T-lymphoma cell line. Of 12 T-lymphoma cell lines investigated, one line, EL-4 azgr (Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, Lyt-2-3-,Ia-, T-200+, sIg-, and FcR-) and, to a lesser extent, the parental cell line, EL-4, produced T cell growth factor(s) (TCGF) when stimulated by the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con A). Induced production of TCGF-E was detected by 6 h and maximal at 18-24 h. Purified TCGF-E from this source had an approximately 30,000 mol wt and the biological activity of TCGF produced by whole spleen cells, including: augmentation of T cell-mitogen responses, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation support dependence, augmented generation of CTL, lack of strain specificity, and failure to stimulate resting T cells. TCGF-E is neither synthesized or secreted by this lymphoma cell line unless stimulated by Con A. X-irradiation up to 7,000 rad failed to inhibit synthesis and secretion. These observations have a practical application in providing a relatively homogeneous clonal cell product for T cell culture support and for structural and functional studies of the TCGF molecule(s). They suggest also a model for examining mechanisms of triggering production and secretion of a regulatory molecule that controls T cell functions.
3 Clonal analysis of primary B cells responsive to the pathogenic bacterium Salmonella typhimurium. In the present study, a modification of the splenic focus system is used to analyze the S. typhimurium strain TML (TML)-specific B cell repertoire. The results show that the frequency of primary TML-specific splenic B cells in CBA/Ca mice is approximately 1 per 10(5) B cells and less than 30% of these B cells are specific for LPS. In contrast, the frequency of memory TML-specific cells is approximately 1 per 5-8 X 10(3) splenic B cells and greater than 95% of these B cells are specific for LPS. These results suggest that the frequency of primary TML-specific B cells is extremely low and that it expands 15-20-fold after antigen exposure. It is interesting that less than 30% of the primary B cells are specific for the LPS molecule since it is considered to be the major antigenic determinant on Salmonella organisms. Furthermore, the majority of the LPS-specific anti-TML antibody-producing clones are directed against the LPS O antigen region. Conversely, more than half to two-thirds of the memory LPS-specific anti-TML B cell clones are directed against the KDO or lipid A region of the LPS molecule. These results indicate that the preferential expansion of LPS-specific B cell clones observed after immunization resides primarily in the B cell subsets responsive to the KDO/lipid A moieties on the LPS molecule. Finally, unlike B cell responses to chemically defined antigens, TML stimulates very little IgG1 antibody. IgG2 and IgA isotypes appear to play a predominant role in anti-TML antibody responses, although all H chain classes are produced to some extent. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the responses reported for two other natural antigens, HA and PC. Hence, the pattern of stimulation by infectious agents, such as S. typhimurium, appears to be distinct from that of synthetic antigens. Thus, the studies presented herein have begun to provide insights into those subsets of B cells responsive to S. typhimurium and other infectious disease organisms.
3 Antibody response of C3H in equilibrium (CKB X CWB)F1 tetraparental mice to poly-L(Tyr,Glu)-poly-D,L-Ala-poly-L-Lys immunization. To test whether the antigen-specific stimulation of low responder-genotype B cells in tetraparental mice is due to a histoincompatibility reaction (allogeneic effect) against these B cells, tetraparental mice were constructed (a) between an Ir-1A low responder to the antigen poly-L(Tyr,Glu)-poly-D,L-Ala--poly-L-Lys. [(T,G)-A--L] and an Ir-1A F1 high responder and (b) between two histoincompatible Ir-lA low responders. In the first case the F1 high responder embryo shares the whole of the H-2 complex, including Ir, with the low responder embryo.
3 Specificity of T cell clones for antigen and autologous major histocompatibility complex products determines specificity for foreign major histocompatibility complex products. We have analyzed a panel of T cell clones that corecognize defined epitopes of the insulin molecule in association with Ia for their patterns of recognition of alloantigens. A striking correlation is observed between recognition of the I-Ab gene product and cow insulin alpha loop and recognition of I-Eu of the PL/J haplotype. These results are consistent with the notion that reactions to foreign major histocompatibility complex (MHC) products reflect molecular mimicry by foreign class II antigens of 'physiologic' complexes formed by autologous class II MHC molecules and antigen.
3 A monoclonal antibody that recognizes B cells and B cell precursors in mice. The monoclonal antibody, RA3-2C2, appears to be specific for cells within the B cell lineage. This antibody does not recognize thymocytes, peripheral T cells, or nonlymphoid hematopoietic cells in the spleen or bone marrow. Nor does it recognize the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, the spleen colony-forming unit, All sIg+ B cells and most plasma cells are RA3-2C2+. In addition, approximately 20% of nucleated bone marrow cells are RA3-2C2+ but sIg-. This population contains B cell precursors that can give rise to sIg+ cells within 2 d in vitro.
1 Use of somatic cell genetics to study chromosomes contributing to antigen plus I recognition by T cell hybridomas. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)/I region-specific T cell hybridomas have been prepared by fusing KLH/I-specific T cell blasts from mice with single pairs of metacentric chromosomes to the inducible, interleukin 2 (IL-2)-secreting T cell hybridoma FS6-14.13.AG2.1. T cell hybridomas with KLH/I receptors were identified by their ability to secrete IL-2 in response to KLH and the appropriate antigen-presenting cells. After cloning and subcloning, KLH/I reactivity was correlated with the presence or absence of metacentric chromosomes derived from the KLH/I-specific T cell blast parent. Hybridomas were identified that had lost all chromosomes 4 and 6 or 16 and 17 derived from their normal T cell parent, but retained the ability to respond to KLH/I. This suggested that products of genes on these chromosomes did not contribute to the specific portions of T cell Ag/I receptors. These gene products would include, of course, kappa and lambda chains and H-2. We did not obtain any T cell hybridomas that had lost both metacentric (8.12) chromosomes derived from T cells of the Robertsonian mouse strain Rb(8.12)5, so we could not draw any conclusions about the contributions of products of genes on these chromosomes. T cell hybridomas with KLH/I reactivity were found that contained only one metacentric (8.12) chromosome derived from this strain. Moreover, a T cell hybridoma was found that retained both metacentric (8.12) chromosomes from its normal T cell parent, but had lost KLH/I reactivity. These results suggested that neither two chromosomes 8 nor two chromosomes 12 were required for antigen/I reactivity in normal T cells and that antigen/I reactivity was controlled, at least in part, by genes mapping on chromosomes other than 8 or 12.
0 Genetic interactions in the spontaneous production of endogenous murine leukemia virus in low leukemic mouse strains. The spontaneous expression of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) in spleen cells of BALB/c, C57BL/6 (B6), and derivative mice was examined as a function of age. The patterns of spontaneous virus induction in vivo correlate with the patterns of virus induction in vitro, which result from the action of two loci, Inc-l and Inb-l (7). Whereas mice carrying Inc-l or Inb-l have similar phenotypes in vitro, they have significantly different phenotypes in vivo. Mice of the Inb-l+/+ genotype, e.g., B6, rarely expressed MuLV, and the titer of MuLV recovered from rare MuLV-positive mice of this genotype was usually low. Mice of the Inc-l+/+ genotype, e.g., BALB/c, expressed low amounts of MuLV early in life, however, from 6-12 mo of age approximately one-half of the Inc-l+/+ mice expressed virus, frequently of high titer. Equal numbers of N-tropic and B-tropic MuLV were recovered from Inb-l+ mice, but predominantly N-tropic MuLV was recovered from Inc-l+ mice. Strains that carry dominant (+) alleles at both Inc-l and Inb-l show higher titers of MuLV earlier in life than strains that carry only Inc-l or Inb-l. The presence of dominant alleles at both loci results in the appearance of predominantly N-tropic virus early in life. These results demonstrate that the principal determinants of spontaneous virus expression in these low leukemic strains of mice are the In loci or genes linked to them. A further inference that can be drawn from these studies is that the appearance of B-tropic virus is by no means a random process but rather results from predictable patterns of MuLV expression and alteration.
3 Galactan-binding antibodies. Diversity and structure of idiotypes. A group of eight IgM hybridoma proteins induced with beta(1,6)-D-galactan-containing antigens has been characterized in terms of primary amino acid sequence and idiotype expression. The H chain amino acid sequences reveal very strong homology in the VH segment although several substitutions are seen that suggest the occurrence of somatic mutation in these IgM molecules. Significant sequence variation was observed in CDR-3, the region generated by the D segment, and the two recombination events, VH-D and D-JH. The number of amino acids in this region contributed by the D segment was found to vary from two to six, yet the overall length of CDR-3 was precisely maintained by the addition of amino acids on either side of D during the recombination processes. These additional amino acids are suggested to result from nucleotide addition by repair enzymes. Idiotypic analysis of these proteins, in conjunction with an assessment of the H chain sequences, has permitted an identification of the molecular basis of both cross-reacting and unique idiotypic determinants expressed by these molecules.
1 Fc-receptors, Ia-antigens, and immunoglobulin on normal and activated mouse T lymphocytes. Using antibody coated bovine erythrocytes we were unable to demonstrate Fc-receptors on either thymus cells or T cells prepared from lymph node cell suspensions by anti-Ig column filtration. However, if parental thymus or lymph node T cells were transferred to X-irradiated F1 hybrids, activated donor T cells recovered from the recipient's spleen (ATC-spleen) were shown to express Fc-receptors. Fc-receptors were also demonstrable on ATC-spleen prepared between strain combinations differing at the M-locus. In marked contrast, Fc-receptors were not detected on ATC recovered from thoracic duct lymph (T.TDL). This applied to (a) H-2-activated T.TDL derived from normal thymus cells, (b) H-2-activated T.TDL derived from thymus cells depleted of B cells, and (c) M-locus-activated T.TDL. Of these three populations, surface Ig (of B cell origin) was detected on a large proportion of the first but not on the second and third populations. Thus, the failure to detect Fc-receptors on any of these populations could not be attributed to blocking by adsorbed surface Ig. In addition, various T-cell populations were examined by a microcytotoxicity assay for the presence of cell surface Ia-antigens. 5--10% of the thymus cells, 20--30% of cortisone-resistant thymus cells, 60--70% of lymph node cells, and 60--80% of ATC-spleen and T.TDL showed Ia.
3 Antigen-specific helper T cells required for dominant production of an idiotype (THId) are not under immune response (Ir) gene control. Responder and nonresponder mice primed with poly-(L-glutamic acid,L-lysine,L-phenylalanine) (GLPhe), the response to which is under the control of immune response (Ir) genes, were used as a source of both types of helper T cells required for a T15 idiotype dominated T-dependent anti-phosphorylcholine (PC) response. It was found that the activity of one of the helper T cells needed for an anti-PC response was under major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked Ir gene control, and only GLPhe-primed responder mice could be used as a source of these cells. These T cells (ThMHC) whose presence is required for in vivo T-B collaboration are found in normal and anti-mu-treated mice, and their activity depends on the hapten being physically linked to the carrier molecule. By contrast, the activity of the second helper T cell (ThId) required for a T15-dominated anti-PC response was present in both GLPhe-primed responder and nonresponder mice. The ThId cell set that is missing or deficient in anti-mu treated mice can be restored by the addition of T cells from normal, carrier-primed donors and restimulating with the priming carrier. When T cells from GLPhe-primed donors are used as a source of ThId cells, both responder and nonresponder donors provide helper cells capable of inducing syngeneic B cells to produce a T15 dominated anti-Pc response. These results are interpreted to suggest that idiotype recognizing helper T cells (ThId) recognize antigen independent of known Ir gene products.
2 Inhibition of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement by the expression of a lambda 2 transgene. The rearrangement of Ig genes is known to be regulated by the production of H and kappa L chains. To determine whether lambda L chains have a similar effect, transgenic mice were produced with a lambda 2 gene. It was necessary to include the H chain enhancer, since a lambda gene without the added enhancer did not result in transgene expression. The lambda 2 transgene with the H enhancer was expressed in lymphoid cells only. The majority of the B cells of newborn transgenic mice produced lambda, whereas kappa + cells were reduced. Concomitantly, serum levels of kappa and kappa mRNA were diminished. By 2 wk after birth the proportion of kappa-expressing cells was dramatically increased. Adults had reduced proportions of B cells that produced lambda only, but the levels of lambda were still higher than in normal littermates. Also, kappa + cells were still lower than in normal mice. Analysis of hybridomas revealed that reduction of kappa gene rearrangement was the basis for the decreased frequency of kappa + cells. Furthermore, many cells also contained an unrearranged H chain allele. It was concluded that feedback inhibition by the lambda 2 together with endogenous H protein may have inhibited recombinase activity in early pre-B cells, leading to inhibition of both H chain and kappa gene rearrangement. Thus, lambda 2 can replace kappa in a feedback complex. The levels of serum lambda 1 and, to a lesser degree, of spleen lambda 1 mRNA were reduced in the lambda 2 transgenic mice. However, the proportion of hybridomas with endogenous lambda gene rearrangement was at least as high as in normal mice. It was therefore concluded that the suppression of functional lambda 1 may be a consequence of decreased selection of endogenous lambda-producing cells because of the excess of transgenic lambda. The escape of kappa-producing cells from feedback inhibition may be the result of several mechanisms that operate to varying degrees, among them: (a) kappa rearrangement during a period in which the recombinase is still active after appearance of a lambda 2/mu stop signal; (b) a B cell lineage that is not feedback inhibited at the pre-B cell stage; (c) subthreshold levels of transgenic lambda 2 in some pre-B cells; and (d) loss of the lambda 2 transgenes in rare pre-B cells.
3 Postnatal expansion of the natural killer and keller cell population in humans identified by the monoclonal HNK-1 antibody. Human natural killer (NK) and killer (K) cells were directly enumerated using a monoclonal antibody (HNK-1) and an immunofluorescence assay. The frequency of cells bearing surface HNK-1 antigen was very low in the newborn (less than 1.0%) and increased progressively through childhood and into adult life. This was correlated with an age-related increase in functional NK and K cell activities. Males had a slightly higher proportion of HNK-1+ cells than females. In addition to HNK-1 expression on the surface membrane, a prominent cytoplasmic expression of HNK-1 antigen was found in some but not all surface HNK-1+ cells. The cytoplasmic accumulation of HNK-1 molecules appeared to occur in more mature cells of this lineage.
1 Interferon inhibits the generation of allospecific suppressor T lymphocytes. The effect of human interferon alpha on the differentiation of functional populations of lymphocytes during the human allogeneic response in vitro was studied. Interferon alpha inhibited the generation of allospecific suppressor T lymphocytes that normally develop from lymphocytes primed in vitro against allogeneic cells. This effect was not the result of the destruction by interferon of precursor suppressor cells but rather to inhibition of their differentiation into active suppressor T lymphocytes. This inhibition was reversible and could be overcome by repeated allogeneic stimulation even in the presence of interferon. Inhibition of the generation of allospecific suppressor lymphocytes by interferon might play an important role in the allogeneic response. Interferon inhibited the proliferation of lymphocytes after allogeneic stimulation in a primary mixed lymphocyte reaction but enhanced their cytotoxicity. Despite the inhibitory effect in the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction, the specific secondary proliferative response of lymphocytes primed against a single HLA-DR antigen was only slightly affected by interferon. On the other hand, the nonspecific secondary proliferative response of lymphocytes primed in the presence of interferon was significantly reduced, indicating that interferon might decrease the recruitment of nonspecific "irrelevant" clones of responding cells during the sensitization period.
3 Tumor necrosis factor alpha cooperates with interleukin 3 in the recruitment of a primitive subset of human CD34+ progenitors. We have recently demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) potentiates interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced growth of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), and favors the generation of dendritic/Langerhans cells. The stimulatory effect of TNF-alpha was detailed in the present study. Thus, CD34+ HPC entering in cycle (S/G2M) after a 48-h pulse with IL-3 expressed the transferrin receptor (TfR), and fluorescence-activated cell sorter-separated TfR+ HPC, but not TfR-HPC, showed a high proliferative response to IL-3. In contrast, TfR-HPC were found to undergo strong proliferation in response to IL-3 + TNF-alpha. Limiting dilution experiments indicated that TNF-alpha increased both the frequency and the average size of clones generated from TfR-HPC as a result of the development of a higher number of large clones. In contrast, TNF-alpha did not enhance the IL-3-dependent proliferation of TfR+ HPC. Preculturing CD34+ HPC for 48 h with TNF-alpha enhanced the subsequent generation of IL-3-dependent colony-forming units. Precultures with TNF-alpha or cultures with suboptimal doses of TNF-alpha allowed the recruitment of cells with both granulocytic and monocytic differentiation potential. Taken together, our results indicate that TNF-alpha recruits a subpopulation of CD34+ HPC hyposensitive to IL-3, with high proliferative capacity and some features of multipotential progenitors, that are likely to be more primitive than those responding to IL-3 alone.
3 Participation of the major histocompatibility complex in antibody recognition of viral antigens expressed on infected cells. The capacity of the antibody repertoire to recognize complex antigens on viral-infected cells was investigated at the level of monoclonal B cell responses. A majority of primary B cells responsive to PR8(H1N1)-infected H-2 syngeneic cells produced antibody that bound viral determinants only in the context of infected cells and not the isolated virion. An examination of the fine specificity of such antibodies revealed that most could be distinguished by a panel of cells infected with closely related heterologous H1 influenza strains. Indeed, most antibodies bound hemagglutinin determinants of PR8 exclusively, and few were broadly cross-reactive. An examination of the same antibodies for their recognition of cell surface antigens revealed that the majority recognized MHC-encoded antigenic determinants. Thus, most BALB.K (H-2k) primary B cells responsive to PR8-L919 (H-2k) cells produced monoclonal antibodies that bound PR8-antigens only in the context of H-2Dk-infected cells. Most C57BL/10 (H-2b) B cells responsive to PR8-EL4 (H-2b) cells produced monoclonal antibodies that bound PR8 antigens only in the context of H-2Kb-infected cells. These latter antibodies were further shown to recognize that H-2Kb molecule by virtue of their capacity to be discriminated by a panel of PR8-infected H-2Kb mutant cells. These findings demonstrate that much of the antibody repertoire is capable of highly specific complex recognition of viral antigenic determinants in the context of the appropriate MHC alloantigen.
0 A cDNA clone expressed in natural killer and T cells that likely encodes a secreted protein. We have isolated a series of cross-hybridizing cDNA clones, as a group designated as NKG5, from a human natural killer (NK) cell clone cDNA library. These clones show a high degree of homology with a previously described gene, 519, which was thought to be T cell specific. A comparison of the full-length cDNA sequence of NKG5 and the published sequence of 519 shows that NKG5 lacks a 242-base segment that is found in 519 and that this deletion leads to the use of a different putative translational start codon. Unlike 519, the predicted NKG5 polypeptide has an NH2-terminal sequence that is strongly hydrophobic, characteristic of a signal peptide, and lacks any additional hydrophobic regions in the remainder of the peptide, suggesting that NKG5 encodes a secreted protein. Both NKG5 and 519 are expressed in NK and T cells but not in a variety of other hematopoietic cell lines. NKG5 is an abundant transcript and its level of expression is about 40 times that of 519 in NK and T cells. Southern blot and DNA sequence analyses suggest that NKG5 and 519 mRNAs are transcripts from a single gene that has allelic polymorphism.
3 Synergistic T cell activation via the physiological ligands for CD2 and the T cell receptor. T cells may be activated either by the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex or the cell surface receptor CD2. A natural ligand for CD2 has been found to be lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), a widely distributed cell surface glycoprotein. To investigate the interaction of these two pathways, we have expressed the cDNA encoding the human CD2 molecule in a murine T cell hybridoma that produces IL-2 in response to HLA-DR antigens. Expression of the CD2 molecule markedly enhances IL-2 production in response to LFA-3+ antigen-bearing stimulator cells, and this stimulation is inhibited by anti-CD2 and anti-LFA-3 mAb. To further define the role of LFA-3 in antigen-dependent T cell activation, we have studied the ability of the purified ligands of CD2 and the TCR to stimulate the hybridoma. Neither liposomes containing purified HLA-DR antigens nor liposomes containing purified LFA-3 were able to stimulate the parent or the CD2+ hybridoma. However, liposomes containing both purified LFA-3 and HLA-DR, the physiological ligands for CD2 and the TCR, respectively, stimulate IL-2 production by the CD2+ but not the parent hybridoma, suggesting that complementary interactions between the TCR-CD3 complex and the CD2 pathway may regulate lymphocyte activation. To determine whether the CD2/LFA-3 interaction participates in cell-cell adhesion and provides an activation signal, we have constructed a cytoplasmic deletion mutant of CD2, CD2 delta B, in which the COOH-terminal 100 amino acids of CD2 have been replaced with a serine. Hybridomas expressing the CD2 delta B molecule were examined. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of CD2 did not alter binding of LFA-3 but eliminated the ability of CD2 to increase the response of the hybridoma to liposomes containing both HLA-DR and LFA-3, demonstrating that adhesion of LFA-3 to CD2 alone was insufficient for activation, and that the cytoplasmic domain was required for LFA-3 stimulation through the CD2 molecule. T cells may be activated by purified LFA-3 binding to CD2 and the TCR interacting with its ligand, and these signals appear to be synergistic for the T cell. These results suggest that the CD2/LFA-3 interaction not only plays a role in cell-cell adhesion but provides a stimulatory signal for T cell activation.
3 Influenza virus site recognized by a murine helper T cell specific for H1 strains. Localization to a nine amino acid sequence in the hemagglutinin molecule. The functional helper T cell line Vir-2, derived from a PR8 (H1N1) influenza virus-immunized BALB/c mouse, proliferates in response to syngeneic antigen-presenting cells and naturally occurring strains of subtype H1 human influenza virus from 1934-1957 and 1977-1980 isolates. A conserved region of the hemagglutinin molecule around amino acid position 115 in the heavy chain (HA1) was implicated as being important in this recognition by the lack of stimulatory activity associated with a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at position 115 in the laboratory mutant RV6, derived from wild-type PR8. Characterization of the stimulatory determinant on the wild-type hemagglutinin molecule was then undertaken using cleavage products and synthetic peptides. Vir-2 cells recognized the reduced and alkylated purified HA1 of PR8 virus, and this reactivity was retained after cleavage at methionine and tryptophan residues. High-pressure liquid chromatography separation of cleavage fragments indicated that a short sequence of the HA1 containing residue 115 was being recognized. This recognition was localized to a nine amino acid segment (positions 111-119) by assaying stimulation with synthetic peptide homologues of different lengths from that region. As with native hemagglutinin, Vir-2 cells responded to active peptides when presented by H-2d but not H-2k antigen-presenting cells.
3 Analysis of Mlsc genetics. A novel instance of genetic redundancy. The identity of the self determinants involved in the selection of the T cell repertoire has been a matter of considerable interest. In addition to the apparent critical role of MHC gene products, accumulated experimental results indicate the importance of non-MHC gene products in T cell repertoire selection. In particular, murine Mlsa and Mlsc determinants have been shown to be highly stimulatory to allogeneic T cells and to be involved in the negative selection (elimination) of self-reactive T cells expressing selected TCR V beta segments. In this work, a unique phenomenon of genetic redundancy is described in the control of Mlsc expression: Mlsc appears to be controlled by at least two unlinked loci, and the product of either one of these loci is sufficient to evoke Mlsc-specific T cell response and to act as a ligand in the deletion of self Mlsc-reactive V beta 3+ T cells. Based on these findings, we propose a possible explanation for the fact that Mls-like genes or gene products have not been identified in other species such as man.
3 Major histocompatibility complex-linked susceptibility or resistance to disease caused by a noncytopathic virus varies with the disease parameter evaluated. The influence of major transplantation antigens on susceptibility to T cell-mediated disease caused by infection with the noncytopathic virus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was evaluated in B10 H-2-congenic mice. Susceptibility to early T cell-mediated liver cell destruction (day 7-9) and early mortality (before day 12) was H-2Dq linked and correlated directly with early (day 6-8) and high cytotoxic T cell activity. In contrast, susceptibility to become an LCMV carrier, inability to rapidly clear virus, or tendency to develop late hepatitis (day 14-17) was linked to Dk and correlated with absence of early cytotoxic T cell activity. Thus, H-2D-regulated T cell-immune responses controlling both virus spread and immunopathology may directly determine the type and severity of disease. The results illustrate that susceptibility to disease caused by one virus may be linked to distinct MHC alleles dependent upon the disease parameter studied.
3 Quantitative variations in the expression of H-2 antigens on murine leukemia virus-induced tumor cells can affect the H-2 restriction patterns of tumor-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes. Comparative quantitative experiments were designed to study the expression of H-2Kd and H-2Dd antigens on three different leukemia cell lines induced by Gross murine leukemia virus (MuLV)in BALB/c (H-2d) mice. The H-2 restriction patterns of syngeneic cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) directed against Gross MuLV-induced tumors were correlated with these quantitations of H-2Kd and H-2Dd antigens, Our results obtained by quantitative absorption of monospecific antisera indicated that the three BALB/c tumor cell lines expressed different amounts of H-2Kd and H-2Dd antigens, with H-2Dd antigen showing the greatest variability in expression because it ranged from barely detectable levels to one-eighth the amount of H-2Dd antigen expressed on normal BALB/c spleen cells. The H-2 restriction patterns of Gross MuLV-specific CTL were directly affected by these quantitative modulations in the expression of H-2Kd and H-2Dd antigens, as revealed by three independent approaches: (a) inhibition of CTL activity by monospecific anti-H-2 sera in the absence of complement; (b)competitive inhibition of CTL-mediated cytotoxicity by the addition of excess tumor cells into the reaction mixture; and (c) analysis of CTL specificities using cloned CTL populations. Our results thus indicate that H-2 restriction of tumor-specific CTL activity can be directed at the target cell level by variations in the expression of H-2 antigens.
3 Sera from patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis contain antibodies to glomerular heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Antibodies, found in human sera from patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, against proteoglycans (PG) derived from bovine and human glomeruli were investigated. PG were isolated by 4 M guanidine-HCl extraction of whole glomeruli, followed by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B ion exchange chromatography. The anionic fractions were further purified by chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B. Biochemical analysis of the two resulting peaks revealed the presence of high molecular weight anionic material containing protein, uronic acid, glucosamine, and galactosamine. Enzymatic and chemical susceptibilities indicated the presence of heparan sulfate PG and a galactosamine-containing PG. Immunologic studies revealed the presence of anti-PG antibodies to both PG peaks of the Sepharose CL-4B column in glomerulonephritis sera. Inhibition studies using an ELISA demonstrated that heparan sulfate was a major antigenic determinant. Cross-reactivity with both mammalian and streptococcal hyaluronate was noted. Inhibition studies also indicated the presence of a second antigenic site containing N-acetylgalactosamine, possibly representing chondroitin or dermatan sulfate PG.
3 Immunochemical characterization of the "native" type III polysaccharide of group B Streptococcus. The type III polysaccharide of -roup B Streptococcus has been isolated and purified by a method that employs washing of intact cells at neutral pH. That the polysaccharide prepared by this procedure is the "native" type III antigen is suggested by its molecular size in excess of 10(6) daltons, its degradation by acid and heat treatment to a fragment with immunologic characteristics of the classical HCl antigen, and its type-specific serologic activity. The type III polysaccharide in native form contains sialic acid, galactose, glucose, glucosamine, heptose, and mannose. It is acidic in nature, is resistant to neuramindiase degradation, contains no O-acetyl groups, and does not share antigenic determinants with capsular type K1 antigen of Escherichia coli or Group B polysaccharide antigen of Neiserria meningitidis.
3 Regulation of T lymphocyte proliferation. Interleukin 2-mediated induction of c-myb gene expression is dependent on T lymphocyte activation state. We previously reported that with time, after antigenic stimulation of antigen-regulated murine T lymphocyte clones, total IL-2-R expression decayed 10-50-fold, commensurate with a decline in the ability of the cells to proliferate to IL-2. However, late after antigenic stimulation, when the cells were refractory to the IL-2-proliferative stimulus, high levels of high affinity IL-2-R remained. In this report we further explore the basis of unresponsiveness to IL-2 in the quiescent clones. We show that the proto-oncogene c-myc is induced in the late cell population by IL-2 to comparable levels observed early after antigen stimulation. IL-2-dependent c-myb induction, however, is seen only early after activation but not in the late-activated population. Analysis of the IL-2-dependent expression of c-myb mRNA with time after antigenic stimulation showed that steadystate c-myb expression declines dramatically with kinetics closely paralleling a decay in IL-2-dependent proliferative ability. In contrast, steadystate c-myc expression remains high throughout this period. Expression of c-myb is critical for proliferation of these cells since antisense oligodeoxy-nucleotide to c-myb can inhibit their IL-2-dependent proliferation. We present evidence for a pathway of c-myb induction via the TCR that is independent of the IL-2/IL-2-R interaction. In addition, the inhibition of IL-2-R-induced c-myb expression by 2-aminopurine and enhanced induction of c-myb via the TCR demonstrate that TCR activation and IL-2-R activation lead to induction of c-myb by different mechanisms.
3 Characteristics of natural killer cells in the murine intestinal epithelium and lamina propria. Highly purified populations of lymphocytes were obtained from the murine intestinal mucosa using EDTA-collagenase isolation procedures in combination with discontinuous density centrifugation. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were separated from lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) and, within these two populations, fractions enriched or depleted in gut granular lymphocytes (gGL) were obtained. Using these cells in cytotoxic assays, it was shown that both IEL and LPL possess natural killer (NK) activity, and this was associated with gGL. The major effector cells of gut NK activity appeared to be Thy-1.2+, Lyt-1.1-, and Lyt-2.1-. The susceptibility of gut NK cells to anti-Thy-1.2 plus complement (C) was significantly higher than that of splenic NK cells. In contrast, anti-asialo GM1 and anti-NK-1.2 plus C only slightly affected the gut NK activity. Thus, the phenotype of the gut NK cells appears to be different from the splenic one and provides further evidence for NK heterogeneity and establishes the compartmentalization of one NK subpopulation. Beige mice, deficient in splenic NK activity, also had very low gut NK activity. W/Wv mice, which lack mast cell precursors, had normal numbers of gGL and diminished, but still present, gut and splenic NK activity. This deficiency did not segregate with the genes responsible for the basic hemopoietic stem cell defect, and these results argue against a close ontogenetic relationship between IEL, gGL, and intestinal mucosal mast cells. The relevance of these observations to the cell lineage of the effector cell of gut NK activity is discussed.
1 The SJL/J T cell response to both spontaneous and transplantable syngeneic reticulum cell sarcoma is mediated predominantly by the V beta 17a+ T cell clonotype. Previous studies have revealed that the reticulum cell sarcoma (RCS) of SJL/J (H-2s, IE-) mice express an "IE-like" stimulatory tumor-associated antigen, the expression of which is requisite for stimulating host T cells necessary for tumor growth. Herein, we present evidence that the predominant T cells raised in the syngeneic response to both spontaneous and transplantable RCS tumors are of the V beta 17a TCR clonotype. The V beta 17a+ clonotype of T cells has been shown to interact with IE allogeneic specificities. We demonstrate that all four characterized RCS-specific T cell hybridomas stained positively for the anti-V beta 17a mAb, KJ23a. Additionally, KJ23a, when added to cocultures of the T cell hybridomas and RCS tumors, inhibited the release of IL-2 by the hybridomas. Further, KJ23a was shown to markedly inhibit the proliferation of SJL/J T cells when cocultured with either spontaneous or transplantable RCS tumor cells. When analyzed by flow cytometry, the T cell blast population raised in response to both spontaneous and transplantable RCS were greater than 80% KJ23a+. These T cells were brightly stained by the anti-CD4 mAb, Gk1.5, and, therefore, represent class II-responsive T cells. In corroboration of the in vitro data, T cells derived from mesenteric lymph nodes of RCS tumor-bearing mice had likewise undergone a similar expansion of V beta 17a+, CD4+ T cells. Together, these results indicate that KJ23a+ T cells play an important and predominant role in the response of SJL/J mice to spontaneous RCS tumors and provide further suggestive evidence that the stimulatory antigen(s) on the RCS tumor is IE or an "IE-like" molecule. Significantly, the important role V beta 17a+ T cells play in the response to RCS suggests a potential therapeutic role for KJ23a mAb in the intervention and prevention of RCS tumors in SJL/J mice.
0 Eleven distinct VH gene families and additional patterns of sequence variation suggest a high degree of immunoglobulin gene complexity in a lower vertebrate, Xenopus laevis. Lower vertebrate species, including Xenopus laevis, exhibit restricted antibody diversity relative to higher vertebrates. We have analyzed more than 180 VH gene-containing recombinant clones from an unamplified spleen cDNA library by selective sequencing of JH and CH positive clones following iterative hybridization screening with family-specific VH probes, 11 unique families of VH genes, each associated with a unique genomic Southern blot hybridization pattern, are described and compared. Considerable variation in the number of hybridizing components detected by each probe is evident. The nucleotide sequence difference between VH families is as great as, if not more than, that reported in other systems, including representatives of the mammalian, avian, and elasmobranch lineages. Some Xenopus Ig gene families encode alternative amino acids at positions that are otherwise invariant or very rarely substituted in known Igs. Furthermore, variations in complementarity determining region sequences among members of the same gene family and high degrees of DH and JH region complexity are described, suggesting that in at least this lower vertebrate species, the diversity of expressed Ig VH genes is not restricted.
3 Major histocompatibility complex restriction of soluble helper molecules in T cell responses to altered self. Evidence for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction of soluble helper effects was observed in the generation of syngeneic killer T cells to trinitrophenyl-altered self. Ia-bearing T cells obscure the observation of such interactions, thus, must be removed to detect MHC restriction of nonspecific soluble helper factor supernates (HFS). Genetic mapping studies demonstrated that the strain producing HFS must be compatible in the H-21A region with the strain utilizing the helper molecules for optimal helper signals to be delivered.
1 Purification of cachectin, a lipoprotein lipase-suppressing hormone secreted by endotoxin-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Previous studies have indicated that endotoxin and other bacterial and protozoal products can stimulate macrophages to produce a factor that can suppress the activity of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), in vivo and in vitro. In the present report we describe the purification of this factor, cachectin, to apparent homogeneity from the conditioned medium of endotoxin-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The isolated protein has an isoelectric point of 4.7 and a subunit molecular weight of 17,000. Although cachectin's isoelectric point and molecular weight are similar to those described for interleukin 1, pure cachectin has no leukocyte-activating factor (LAF) activity. Cachectin at a concentration of 10(-11) M has the ability to suppress the LPL activity of the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line by 80%. Binding studies using radio-labeled cachectin and 3T3-L1 adipocytes and C2 myotubules revealed approximately 10(4) high-affinity receptors per cell on both cell types (Ka, 3 X 10(9]. Cachectin receptors were also present on liver membranes but were absent on erythrocytes and lymphocytes. The isolation of cachectin and characterization of its receptor should facilitate further investigations into the role of cachectin and other macrophage mediators in the metabolic derangements that occur during infection and cachexia.
3 Defective lymphopoiesis in bone marrow of motheaten (me/me) and viable motheaten (mev/mev) mutant mice. I. Analysis of development of prothymocytes, early B lineage cells, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-positive cells. This study identifies defects in the early stages of lymphopoiesis that may contribute to the abnormalities in the development and/or function of peripheral T and B lymphocytes in mice homozygous for the motheaten (me/me) and viable motheaten (mev/mev) mutations. The results indicate that in me/me and mev/mev mice prothymocytes in bone marrow are present in essentially normal numbers, as determined by intrathymic injection, but apparently lack the ability to home effectively to the thymus, as determined by intravenous transfer; early B lineage cells in bone marrow, identified by the B220 antigen, are markedly depleted, including immature B cells (sIg+), pre-B cells (cIg+, sIg-), and pro-B cells (B220+, cIg-, sIg-); TdT+ bone marrow cells, especially a subset that expresses the B220 B lineage antigen, are markedly depleted by two weeks of age; normal numbers of TdT+ thymocytes are present during the first 3 wk of postnatal life, but rapidly decrease thereafter. The results further indicate that neither the defective thymus homing capacity of prothymocytes nor the deficiency of TdT+ bone marrow cells is due to autoantibodies. The possible relationship of the defective development of lymphoid precursor cells to the premature onset of thymic involution and to the abnormalities of peripheral T and B lymphocytes in me/me and mev/mev mice is discussed; as are the results of in vitro studies (presented in a companion paper), which suggest that a primary defect in the stromal microenvironment of the bone marrow is responsible for the abnormal development of the lymphoid precursor cells.
3 Cell surface expression of class II histocompatibility antigens occurs in the absence of the invariant chain. The invariant chain is a glycoprotein transiently associated with the alpha and beta subunits of class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex during their transport to the cell surface. An expression assay with cDNA clones transfected into simian COS cells was used to test whether the invariant chain is required for assembly and transport of human class II antigens. COS cells do not express detectable levels of RNA from the endogenous invariant chain gene. Cell surface expression of the DP, DQ, and DR antigens was observed in COS cells transfected with the respective alpha and beta chain cDNA clones. Analysis of RNA from the transfected cells showed that the human genes were transcribed in COS cells and that the endogenous simian class II and invariant chain genes were not induced. Cotransfections with an invariant chain cDNA clone did not alter the levels of class II antigens at the cell surface. Biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the invariant chain cDNA was expressed into a protein which associated with DR alpha and beta chains. Efficient expression of DR antigen in absence of invariant chain was also observed at the surface of a human fibroblast line stably transfected with DR alpha and beta cDNA. This study demonstrates that expression of all three human class II antigens can be achieved with cDNAs cloned in expression vectors. Furthermore, cell surface expression of class II major histocompatibility complex antigens can occur in absence of invariant chain. The postulated role of the invariant chain in class II antigen transport to the cell surface must be reevaluated. The invariant chain may rather be involved in functional properties of class II molecules such as antigen presentation.
0 Immunologic injury of cultured cells infected with measles virus. I. role of IfG antibody and the alternative complement pathway. In these studies, a number of human cell lines including epithelial, neural, glial, and lymphoid cells infected with several strains of measles virus were found to be lysed upon incubation with fresh sera from humans containing antibody measles virus. In all instances, the cytolytic event was mediated by alternative complement (C) pathway without a significant contribution from classical pathway. In contrast, isolated measles virus in conjunction with antibody was found to selectively activate the classical C pathway. Measles antibodies of the IgG class, but not the IgA class, possessed cytolytic potential against cells infected with measles virus. Human IgG antibodies could directly activate the alternative C pathway. No defect was found in cytolytic measles antibody in sera or cerebrospinal fluid from patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, nor was the alternative C pathway impaired in sera from these patients. Sera from newborn humans exhibited a functional alternative C pathway.
3 Xenogeneic human anti-mouse T cell responses are due to the activity of the same functional T cell subsets responsible for allospecific and major histocompatibility complex-restricted responses. Human T cells respond strongly to mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. The response is directed predominantly to the polymorphic determinants of the MHC antigens and there is little or no response to the nonpolymorphic determinants or to non-MHC antigens. Human cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are generated specific for the mouse class I MHC antigens and the CTL effectors are blocked by anti-Leu-2a antisera. Human interleukin 2-producing T cells are generated specific for mouse class II antigens and their induction is blocked by anti-Leu-3a antisera. These and other considerations lead us to propose a model for the T cell receptor that provides an explanation for several of the features of T cell recognition. In this model, the recognition of the "class" (I or II) of MHC antigen is separate from the recognition of the polymorphic determinants. We suggest that the initial recognition of the conserved "class" determinants positions another domain of the receptor so that it can only engage with the part of the MHC molecule carrying the polymorphic determinants.
3 Distinct molecular forms of human T cell receptor gamma/delta detected on viable T cells by a monoclonal antibody. A second type of TCR molecule has been identified on human and murine T lymphocytes, which involves the protein products of the gamma and delta genes. T lymphocytes bearing this receptor may constitute a separate cell lineage with a distinct immune function. We have produced an mAb, which specifically detects human TCR-gamma/delta in native as well as denatured states, this in contrast to previously used anti-gamma chain peptide sera, which only reacted with denatured protein. The receptor occurs in different molecular forms, with or without interchain disulphide bonds, in which a delta chain may or may not be detected by cell surface iodination. The mAb is reactive with all these receptor forms. Therefore, this antibody could be used to determine the expression of TCR-gamma/delta on viable human T lymphocytes. In normal individuals, TCR-gamma/delta was found on a subset composing 2-7% of CD3+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood and 0.1-1.0% in thymus. The majority of these cells do not express the CD4 or CD8 antigens, although a significant percentage of CD8+ cells was found. TCR-gamma/delta+ cells in peripheral blood are resting lymphocytes, as judged by ultrastructural analysis. T cell clones with different receptor types can display MHC-nonrestricted cytolytic activity, which is shown to be induced by the culture conditions, most likely by growth factors such as IL-2. This strongly suggests that TCR-gamma/delta does not play a role in target cell recognition in MHC-nonrestricted cytotoxicity. The anti-TCR-gamma/delta antibody can specifically induce cytotoxic activity in clones expressing the receptor, but in addition inhibit growth factor induced cytotoxicity, which indicates a regulatory role of the TCR-gamma/delta/CD3 complex in MHC-nonrestricted cytotoxicity.
2 Antigenic properties of cultured tumor cell lines derived from spleens of Friend virus-infected BALB/c and BALB/c-H-2b mice. BALB/c-H-2b (BALB.B) mice are less susceptible to the Friend virus (FV) disease syndrome than congenic BALB/c (H-2d) mice, and spleen cells from FV-infected BALB.B mice are markedly less tumorigenic on transplantation to syngeneic hosts than those from FV-infected BALB/c mice. For these reasons we investigated the expression of FV-associated cell surface antigens on cultured, FV-trnasformed cell lines of BALB.B and BALB/c origin. Both cell lines induced transplantation immunity in syngeneic hosts toward further implantations of the same tumor, BALB.B cells being significantly more potent in this respect than BALB/c cells. BALB.B tumor cells, which produce complete, infectious FV, expressed both the cell surface antigen, FMR (corresponding to the cytotoxic antibodies in anti-FV antisera), and virus envelope antigen (VEA, corresponding to the virus-neutralizing antibodies in the anti-FV antisera). BALB/c tumor cells, on the other hand, which are FV-nonproducers, expressed no FMR antigen, but did express VEA on their surfaces for at least 100 passages in culture. These cells could induce FV-neutralizing but not cytotoxic anti-FMR antibodies when used to immunize syngeneic hosts. The absence of FMR antigen may be the basis for the reduced capacity of BALB/c tumor cells, by comparison with BALB.B tumor cells, to induce transplantation immunity. After about the 125th serial transfer in culture, BALB/c tumor cells spontaneously ceased to express VEA and simultaneously became very weak inducers of transplantation immunity in BALB/c hosts. This loss of VEA did not stem from the loss of either the spleen focus-forming virus or the helper virus genomes from these cells, since both viruses could still be recovered from the cell line.
0 Downregulation of cell-surface CD4 expression by simian immunodeficiency virus Nef prevents viral super infection. The nef gene product encoded by the mac239 proviral clone of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) markedly enhances viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo. We have used this biologically active nef isolate to examine the phenotype of Nef in retrovirally transduced human T cells in culture. SIV Nef is shown to dramatically inhibit cell-surface expression of the CD4 glycoprotein without significantly affecting the total steady-state level of cellular CD4. This downregulation of the cell-surface CD4 receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection correlated with the acquisition of resistance to superinfection by HIV-1. However, SIV Nef did not affect the level of gene expression directed by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. It is hypothesized that downregulation of cell-surface CD4 by Nef facilitates the efficient release of infectious progeny virions and, hence, viral spread in vivo.
2 Heterogeneity of murine regulatory T cells. I. Subpopulations of amplifier and suppressor T cells. Immunization of C3H/HeJ mice with 4 X 10(9) SRBC yields a whole splenic T-cell population which can, upon transfer, specifically suppress recipient direct and indirect plaque-forming cells (PFC) responses to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). Discontinuous bovine serum albumin density gradient fractionation of these T cells demonstrated a population of low density T cells which augmented and a population of high density T cells which suppressed recipient responses irrespective of the number of T cells transferred. Moreover, infusion of admixtures of low and high density cells resulted in intermediate regulatory functions which could be predicted by knowing the regulatory capacity of each population alone. In addition to heterogeneity existing among regulatory T cells as regards amplification and suppression, it appeared that heterogeneity existed within the suppressor T population. Thus, T cells capable of inhibiting direct PFC could be distinguished from those suppressing indirect PFC by their differential localization in peripheral lymphoid tissue, differences in the dissipation of suppressive influences during incubation at 37 degrees C, and by differences in the possible requirement for adherent cell populations. While the relative frequency of both low density amplifier and high density suppressor cells increased with the dose of SRBC used for their induction, it appeared that suppressor cells might be generated in response to feedback signals from amplifier cells. These studies indicate that further delineation of heterogeneity existing within suppressor populations may be helpful in defining mechanisms required for the induction and manifestation of suppressive regulatory forces.
3 Localization of gamma/delta T cells to the intestinal epithelium is independent of normal microbial colonization. Using monoclonal antibodies identifying all gamma/delta and alpha/beta T cell receptors in cytofluorometric analysis, we have compared the composition of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (i-IEL) in euthymic and athymic germ-free (GF) and conventional (SPF) mice. The results show a marked influence of microbial colonization in the numbers of single-positive (CD4+ or CD8+) alpha/beta i-IEL, but little effect in the pool size or characteristics of gamma/delta i-IEL. In young athymic mice, virtually no alpha/beta i-IEL are detected, while considerable numbers of gamma/delta i-IEL remain, though reduced in GF animals.
3 P-24: a human leukemia-associated and lymphohemopoietic progenitor cell surface structure identified with monoclonal antibody. This study was directed at surface structures that are found on human lymphohemopoietic progenitor cells in normal and leukemic bone marrow. A monoclonal antibody was produced against an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line of the pre-B phenotype; this antibody (BA-2) was used to demonstrate a cell surface polypeptide of approximately 24,000 mol wt that migrates similarly in both reduced and nonreduced form. This polypeptide, p24/BA-2, was shown by immune precipitation and gel electrophoresis and cell distribution studies to be different from HLA-DR and gp 100/cALLa. p24/BA-2 was present on the surface of 77% (54/70) of cases of non-T, non-B ALL; BA-2 staining was less bright or nondetectable in surface Ig+ (SIg+) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and T ALL and nondetectable on peripheral T and B lymphocytes. Approximately 3% of bone marrow mononuclear cells were p24/BA-2+, and these cells were E rosette-, surface (SIg-), and nonphagocytic. Marrow TdT+ progenitor cells were frequently p 24/BA-2+. Results suggest that p24/BA-2 represents a surface structure present on lymphohemopoietic bone marrow progenitor cells and that most common types of ALL bear the p25/BA-2 structure.
3 Encephalitogenic T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein. An unusual bias in antigen recognition. Class II-restricted T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) have been generated from PL/J and (PL/J X SJL/J)F1 [((PLSJ)F1] mice following sensitization to rat MBP. Of 17 T cell clones generated from (PLSJ)F1 mice, 5 are I-Au(A alpha uA beta u) restricted, one is restricted to I-As(A alpha sA beta s), 10 are restricted to hybrid I-A(u X s)F1 (A alpha sA beta u) determinants, and one clone is restricted to hybrid I-E(u X s) (E alpha uE beta s) molecules. Thus, of 16 I-A-restricted T cell clones generated from (PLSJ)F1 mice, only one is I-As-restricted, reflecting a lack of priming to MBP in association with I-As. T cell clones restricted to I-Au and to I-E (E alpha u E beta s) molecules recognize mouse (self) MBP. Furthermore, only the five T cell clones restricted to I-Au molecules recognize a determinant in common with mouse (self) MBP within the encephalitogenic N-terminal peptide. Three such I-Au restricted T cell clones, derived independently, cause paralysis in 100% of (PL/J X SJL/J)F1 mice tested. Acute, chronic unremitting, and chronic relapsing paralysis are all induced following injection of these clones. Administration of greater numbers of cloned T cells causes acute and fatal experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, while administration of lower numbers of cloned T cells is associated with chronic unremitting and relapsing paralysis. Paralysis induced with T cell clones shares many clinical, immunologic, and histologic aspects with human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Histopathology reveals perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, demyelination, and remyelination. These studies demonstrate the utility of T cell clones for analyzing the association between class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and disease susceptibility.
2 Quantitative studies of in situ immune complex glomerulonephritis in the rat induced by planted, cationized antigen. Cationized human IgG can bind to the rat glomerular basement membrane (GBM), act as planted antigen, and induce in situ immune complex formation accompanied by severe glomerulonephritis. Perfusion of highly cationized human IgG (isoelectric point {more than} 9.5) via the left renal artery resulted in preferential localization within the perfused kidney (up to 56 percent of dose injected); after intravenous administration, only 4 percent was bound to the kidneys. The planted antigen was localized along the glomerular capillary walls and was accessible for antibody administered intravenously 1 h after perfusion, when virtually no antigen remained in the circulation. Persistence of cationized human IgG in the perfused kidney was markedly prolonged when complexed with antibody; one-half the cationized human IgG was still present after 12 d. There was a difference in the disappearance rates of antigen and antibody, as cationized human IgG was removed faster from the kidney than the antibody, the binding of which remained almost unchanged during the first week. Renal perfusion of a minimum of 20 mug of cationized human IgG, followed by intravenous injection of antibody, regularly induced severe glomerulonephritis with a proteinuria of at least 100 mg/24 h. The degree and the persistence of proteinuria induced depended on the dose of cationized human IgG perfused. Experiments using radiolabeled antigen and antibody showed that after renal perfusion of 20 mug cationized human IgG, 11.1 mug was kidney bound at the time of antibody injection. At the onset of proteinuria, 4.0 mug of antigen and 31.9 mug of anti-human IgG antibody were present in the perfused kidney. Immunofluorescence revealed immune deposits consisting of cationized human IgG and rabbit IgG (anti-human IgG) along the GBM. The staining pattern was linear (confluent) during the first 2 d and became granular during the course of the disease. Electronmicroscopically, a prominent finding was the accumulation of dense deposits, mainly in the subepithelial space and beneath the slit pores.
3 Activation of murine B lymphocytes by anti-immunoglobulin is an inductive signal leading to immunoglobulin secretion. Cultures of isolated mouse splenic B lymphocytes activated by the divalent F(ab')2 fragment of purified rabbit anti-mouse Fab or class-specific anti-mouse IgM antibodies can be driven on to high rate Ig secretion by the addition of the supernatant fluid of a 24-h culture of concanavalin A-activated spleen cells (SN). The polyclonal antibody response to anti-Ig pus SN is comparable in magnitude with the lipopolysaccharide response as measured in a reverse plaque assay. The addition of SN can be delayed for 24 h after addition of anti-Ig without changing the kinetics of the response. Addition at 48 h delays the response by 24 h. The response to F(ab')2 anti-Fab plus SN is sensitive to Fc-dependent inhibition because intact anti-Fab antibodies inhibit strongly at relatively low concentrations. The monovalent Fab' fragment fails to induce Ig secretion, indicating that cross-linkage of surface immunoglobulin is required. Although the production of active SN is T cell dependent, the response to anti-Ig plus SN is T independent. These findings are interpreted as a polyclonal model of a thymus-dependent antibody response. X
3 Activity of antifolates against Pneumocystis carinii dihydrofolate reductase and identification of a potent new agent. The therapy of Pneumocystis carinii (PC) pneumonia is often unsuccessful, particularly in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Because of difficulties in growing the organism in vitro or obtaining purified organisms, current treatment choices have been made with little information on the metabolic effects of therapeutic agents on PC. This report quantitates the effects of the commonly used antifolates as well as the classic antineoplastic antifolate methotrexate and a lipid-soluble analogue, trimetrexate, on the target enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), in the PC organisms. Trimethoprim and pyrimethamine were found to be weak inhibitors (ID50 = 39,600 and 2,800 nM, respectively), while methotrexate and trimetrexate were potent reductase inhibitors (ID50 = 1.4 and 26.1 nM, respectively). transport studies with radiolabeled compounds showed that compounds with the classic folate structure (methotrexate and leucovorin) were not taken up by the intact PC organisms. In contrast, trimetrexate exhibited rapid uptake. These results suggest a major therapeutic advantage may be gained by combining a potent, readily transported PC DHFR inhibitor such as trimetrexate with the reduced folate leucovorin to achieve a highly potent antiprotozoan effect while preventing toxicity to mammalian cells.
0 T lymphocyte-mediated suppression of myeloma function in vitro. III. Regulation of antibody production in hybrid myeloma cells by T lymphocytes. To investigate the mechanisms by which T lymphocytes regulate myeloma function in vitro, the effects of regulatory T cells on antibody secretion by a hybrid myeloma cell line were examined. Suppressor T cells (Ts) specific for idiotypic determinants on M315 (IgA, lambda 2 anti-2,4-dinitrophenol and anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenol [TNP]) and MPC 11 (IgG2b, kappa) myeloma proteins inhibit antibody secretion by the appropriate parental myeloma cells. When cocultured with a hybrid cell line derived by fusion of MOPC 315 and MPC 11 myelomas, the idiotype-reactive Ts inhibit secretion of only the immunoglobulin (Ig) bearing the relevant idiotype. In contrast, syngeneic TNP-reactive cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) inhibit antibody secretion by TNP-binding MOPC 315 cells but not by MPC 11 cells in the presence of soluble TNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and this inhibition probably represents a prelytic effect of the CTL. Such TNP-reactive CTL, in the presence of TNP-KLH, inhibit both IgA and IgG secretion by the MOPC 315-MPC 11 hybrid, which is consistent with a prelytic effect. Thus, myeloma hybrids are a useful tool for investigating the effector function of regulatory T cells. These results are discussed with reference to the mechanisms of action of regulatory T cells and their relevance to modulation of physiologic humoral immune responses.
0 The natural history of encephalomyocarditis virus-induced myositis and myocarditis in mice. Viral persistence demonstrated by in situ hybridization. Picornaviruses can initiate chronic inflammation that persists after the virus can no longer be cultured from inflamed tissues. In an attempt to understand this transition we have sought evidence for viral persistence by methods that detect viral genome independent of whether or not whole competent virus is present. In mice infected with a myotropic variant of encephalomyocarditis virus, EMC-221A, virus can be cultured in high yield at 1 wk and in low yield at 2 wk from skeletal muscle, heart, and brain; a small number of plaque-forming units could be cultured from brain at 4 wk. By contrast, in situ hybridization detected viral nucleic acid at least a week or two thereafter, often in single cells. In the skeletal muscle, inflammation disappeared by 3 wk, but in heart it remained for the full 12 wk of observation. In the brain, microglial nodules, sometimes with associated viral nucleic acid, were present for a long period. Application of this technique allows a more accurate assessment of the role of viral persistence in the pathogenesis of virus-initiated but apparently autoimmune inflammation.
3 Promoter of the mouse gene encoding calcium-independent nitric oxide synthase confers inducibility by interferon gamma and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) can be expressed by many types of mammalian cells in response to diverse signals acting synergistically, including cytokines and microbial products. We previously showed that induction of iNOS in mouse macrophages by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was at the transcriptional level. From a mouse genomic library, we now cloned a 1,749-bp fragment from the 5'-flanking region of the iNOS gene, and used S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension to identify the mRNA transcription start site within it. The mRNA initiation site is preceded by a TATA box and at least 22 oligonucleotide elements homologous to consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors involved in the inducibility of other genes by cytokines or bacterial products. These include 10 copies of IFN-gamma response element; 3 copies of gamma-activated site; 2 copies each of nuclear factor-kappa B, IFN-alpha-stimulated response element, activating protein 1, and tumor necrosis factor response element; and one X box. Plasmids in which all or the downstream one half or one third of this region of iNOS were linked to a reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase were transfected into cells of the RAW264.7 macrophage-like line. All these constructs conferred inducibility of the iNOS promoter by LPS, but only the construct containing all 1,749 bp conferred synergistic inducibility by IFN-gamma plus LPS.
1 Discovery of Fur binding site clusters in Escherichia coli by information theory models. Fur is a DNA binding protein that represses bacterial iron uptake systems. Eleven footprinted Escherichia coli Fur binding sites were used to create an initial information theory model of Fur binding, which was then refined by adding 13 experimentally confirmed sites. When the refined model was scanned across all available footprinted sequences, sequence walkers, which are visual depictions of predicted binding sites, frequently appeared in clusters that fit the footprints ( approximately 83% coverage). This indicated that the model can accurately predict Fur binding. Within the clusters, individual walkers were separated from their neighbors by exactly 3 or 6 bases, consistent with models in which Fur dimers bind on different faces of the DNA helix. When the E. coli genome was scanned, we found 363 unique clusters, which includes all known Fur-repressed genes that are involved in iron metabolism. In contrast, only a few of the known Fur-activated genes have predicted Fur binding sites at their promoters. These observations suggest that Fur is either a direct repressor or an indirect activator. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis Fur models are highly similar to the E. coli Fur model, suggesting that the Fur-DNA recognition mechanism may be conserved for even distantly related bacteria.
1 Flexibility of the T cell repertoire. Self tolerance causes a shift of T cell receptor gene usage in response to insulin. Bovine insulin(BI)-specific I-Ab-restricted T cell clones have been characterized for fine specificity and TCR gene usage. We have demonstrated that mouse strains carrying H-2b on three different genetic backgrounds (C57BL, BALB, and 129) rearrange and express the V beta 6 gene in a large proportion (36%) of insulin-specific clones. In these strains, the non-MHC background did not seem to influence TCR gene usage in response to BI. The V beta 6+ clones appeared to be selected by the antigen. In contrast, no V beta 6+ clones could be isolated from (B6 x DBA/2)F1 mice, where V beta 6+ (and V beta 8.1+) T cells are deleted by self tolerance to Mls-1a. Thus, although a small proportion of residual V beta 6+ cells had been demonstrated in Mls-1a mice, these cells could not be retrieved in a response that uses V beta 6 predominantly. In functional terms, therefore, the deletion of V beta 6 by self tolerance appears to be complete. Instead of V beta 6, the majority (up to 60%) of I-Ab- as well as I-Ad-restricted insulin-specific clones from the (B6 x DBA/2)F1 mice expressed V beta 8.2 and V beta 8.3. This shift of gene usage was not accompanied by any detectable change in the fine specificity pattern of response. Thus, in the insulin-specific response, the flexibility of T cell repertoire fully compensates for deletions caused by self tolerance.
3 Rare peripheral T cells migrate to and persist in normal mouse thymus. The traffic of T cells between the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs is generally thought to be unidirectional. Using a technique of lymphocyte transfer between Thy-1 congenic mice, we demonstrate here the entry of rare peripheral lymph node T cells into the normal mouse thymus. At time points from 3 h to 24 wk after transfer, donor peripheral T cells were present in the host thymus, mainly as scattered single cells confined to the medulla. At 2 wk after transfer, donor T cells constituted 0.2% of the medullary thymocytes (compared with 11% of the peripheral lymph node T cells). As a population, these cells exhibited a stable mature immunophenotype (Ly-1hi, PNAlo, and mixed L3T4- and Lyt-2+). A minority of the donor T cells expressed high levels of the MEL-14 "homing receptor". The thymic medulla thus exhibits features of a peripheral lymphoid organ but differs in its low rate of turnover of recirculating T cells.
2 An intrinsic B cell defect is required for the production of autoantibodies in the lpr model of murine systemic autoimmunity. Mice homozygous for the gene lpr develop marked lymphadenopathy and a spectrum of autoantibodies closely resembling that of human systemic lupus erythematosus. The unusual T cell phenotype of the expanded lymphocyte population and the T-dependence of several antibodies in this strain have suggested that primary T cell abnormalities underlie the autoimmune syndrome. Using double chimeras, we now show that expression of the lpr gene in B cells is absolutely necessary for autoantibody production. Combinations of anti-Thy 1.2 + C' treated bone marrow from congenic strains of C57BL/6 mice, differing only at the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) and lpr loci, were transferred into lethally irradiated B6/lpr mice. Double chimerism was documented by allotype-specific surface IgD and IgM immunofluorescence assay of peripheral blood and by allotype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for total IgM in serum. Despite the presence of both +/+ and lpr B cells, IgM and IgG2a anti-chromatin as well as IgM anti-IgG were entirely the products of lpr B cells. Total serum IgG2a and IgG1 were also dominated by the lpr phenotype but not to the same extent. A similar experiment using B6/lpr-Igha recipients confirmed these findings. Additional experiments in which B6/lpr recipients were infused with ratios of donor bone marrow favoring B6.C20 +/+ over B6/lpr showed that even though +/+ B cells were overrepresented, autoantibodies were only of the lpr allotype. In addition, in the presence of lpr B cells, normal B cells showed little response to an exogenous, T cell-dependent antigen. The data thus indicate that lpr B cells manifest an intrinsic abnormality which is essential for autoantibody production in the lpr model.
2 A cell-mediated reaction against glomerular-bound immune complexes. Lewis rats were given a single i.v. injection of soluble immune complexes containing human serum albumin (HSA) and rabbit anti-HSA antibodies, prepared in antigen excess. This resulted in localization of HSA and rabbit gamma globulin (RGG) in glomerular mesangial regions without producing definite histologic changes. 24 h after the injection of immune complexes, groups of these rats received lymph node cells or T-cell preparations from syngeneic donors sensitized to RGG, HSA, or ovalbumin; another group received no cells. All of these groups and a group of normal control rats were given injections of [3H]thymidine at 18, 27, and 44 h. The animals were killed 48 h after the time of cell transfer. In histologic sections, glomerular abnormalities were found only in some of the animals that had received immune complexes and lymph node cells or T-cell populations from donors sensitized to HSA or RGG; the lesions were characterized by focal and segmental increase in cells in mesangial regions. Autoradiographs revealed significantly greater numbers of labeled cells in mesangial regions and glomerular capillaries in the groups that had received immune complexes and cells from HSA- or RGG-sensitized donors than in any of the other groups. Electronmicroscopic studies suggested that the increase in cellularity in mesangial regions resulted from an influx of mononuclear phagocytes. The findings indicate that cell-mediated reactions can be initiated by the interaction between sensitized T lymphocytes and antigens present in immune complexes within mesangial regions.
0 Biological activities of a human pluripotent hemopoietic colony stimulating factor on normal and leukemic cells. We studied the biological effects of pluripoietin, a human pluripotent hemopoietic colony-stimulating factor (CSF) purified from the 5637 bladder carcinoma cell line. We found that this human CSF appears to be a unique hemopoietic growth factor, differing from interleukin 3 (IL-3) by virtue of its leukemia differentiating activity in mouse and man, and from mouse granulocyte CSF, which does have differentiation-inducing activity, but lacks pluripoietic activity. In addition, differences from IL-3 were observed in cross-species activity on normal and leukemic cells.
3 The specificity of cellular immune responses in guinea pigs. I. T cells specific for 2,4-dinitrophenyl-o-tyrosyl residues. Guinea pigs immunized with the hapten 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) coupled directly to Mycobacterium tuberculosis of strain H37Ra (DNP-H37) show a variety of cell-mediated immune responses to DNP coupled to protein carriers. The cells responsible for this specific response are thought to be T lymphocytes for the following reasons: Guinea pigs immunized with DNP-H37 displayed delayed hypersensitivity reactions to several DNP-proteins and contact sensitivity to dinitrofluorobenzene. Peritoneal exudate lymphocytes (PELs) obtained from DNP-H37 immune animals respond to DNP-proteins with DNA systhesis and cause inhibition of macrophage migration. PELs are highly enriched in T lymphocytes and contain few immunoglobulin-bearing cells. Further depletion of immunoglobulin-bearing cells from this population does not diminish the in vitro proliferative response to antigen. Nitrophenyl conjugates of proteins lacking a paranitro group stimulated DNA synthesis poorly or not at all, indicating the importance of the paranitro group of DNP in antigen recognition by T cells in this system. In this respect, the specificity of T cells resembles that of DNP-specific antibody from the same animals. On the other hand, DNP conjugates of copolymers of glutamic acid and lysine and DNP conjugated to proteins via an interposed beta-alanyl-glycyl-glycyl spacer failed to stimulate DNA synthesis, although such compounds bind very efficiently to anti-DNP antibody. By contrast, DNP conjugates of synthetic polypeptide carriers containing as little as 7% tyrosine strongly stimulated DNA synthesis in DNP-H37 immune PELs. That the determinant responsible for this stimulation was DNP coupled to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine was shown by selective removal of DNP from tyrosine by thiolysis with 2-mercaptoethanol, which abolished their ability to stimulate T cells.
1 Stepwise progression of B lineage differentiation supported by interleukin 7 and other stromal cell molecules. Growth of early B precursor cells was investigated in vitro by using rIL-7 and IL-7-defective stromal cell line PA6 as separate growth signals. B cell development proceeds through three sequential stages different from the growth signal requirement. The cells in the first stage require PA6 alone for the proliferation, and differentiate into the second stage, which requires both PA6 and IL-7 for its growth. When IL-7 is available for the cells in the second stage, they proliferate extensively on the PA6 layer, and some acquire the ability to proliferate in response to IL-7 alone. This sequential change of growth signal requirement, however, does not proceed autonomously along the time schedule. The possibility that it is primarily directed by the result of Ig gene rearrangement is considered. This mode of growth control may explain why only functional B cells are selected in the error-prone process of Ig gene rearrangement during B lineage differentiation.
1 Pathogenesis of arteritis of SL/Ni mice. Possible lytic effect of anti-gp70 antibodies on vascular smooth muscle cells. The SL/Ni strain of mice spontaneously develops a necrotizing polyarteritis (NPA) that is histologically quite similar to human polyarteritis nodosa. This NPA most frequently affected parametrial tissues and/or ovaries of females and small arterioles of the major salivary glands. Electron microscopic studies of early arterial lesions revealed massive budding of C-type particles from arterial smooth muscle cells just before or at the onset of arteritis. In addition, binding of mouse IgG and C3 to the plasma membrane of virus-producing smooth muscle cells was shown by immunoelectron microscopy. Antibody-bound muscle cells showed disintegration of their plasma membrane, but degeneration and necrosis of muscle cells were not associated with dense infiltration of neutrophils. SL/Ni mice had natural antibodies that bound specifically to a fibroblast cell line infected with an endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) recovered from a SL/Ni mouse. Most of the natural antibodies were cytotoxic in the presence of murine complement. Western blot immunoassays revealed that among 14 SL/Ni female mice tested, all of the 9 mice that were affected by arteritis had anti-gp70 antibodies, while the 3 anti-gp70- mice were not affected. The presence of anti-p30 or anti-p15 (anti-p12) antibodies, which were also detected in some SL/Ni mice, did not correlate with the development of arteritis. These results strongly support the hypothesis that NPA in SL/Ni mice is mediated by the lysis of arterial smooth muscle cells due to the deposition of cytotoxic natural antibodies directed to cell membrane-bound gp70 molecules of an endogenous ecotropic MuLV.
3 The effects of antigen on the migration of recirculating lymphocytes through single lymph nodes. The increased input of RL into LN starts within 3 h after antigenic stimulation and is due to an increase in the number of RL passing through a LN. It is not associated with an altered transit time through a LN of the majority of RL and it cannot occur in the absence of high endothelial PCV. The immediate decrease in the output of RL from an antigen-stimulated LN is due to a delay in the exit from that LN of RL which had entered the LN before antigen was given. The decrease in cell output from a LN after antigen administration affects blast cells produced within the LN as well as small lymphocytes and is not specific for RL. There are at least two distinct mechanisms controlling the migration of RL through an antigen-stimulated LN. The first controls the increased input of RL which occurs only through high endothelial PCV. The second controls the immediate decrease in cell output, which although it does not occur at the level of the high endothelial PCV, can only occur in organized lymphoid tissue. The increased input of RL into an antigen-stimulated LN and the decreased cell output from the LN can occur independently and are possibly controlled by different mechanisms.
3 Active lambda and kappa antibody gene rearrangement in Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cell lines. The two Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed cell lines, BM18-4 and ABC-1, undergo immunoglobulin L-chain gene recombination during passage in tissue culture. BM18-4 cells are capable of kappa gene recombination, whereas ABC-1 cells are capable of both kappa and lambda gene recombination. The expression of H chains is apparently not necessary for continuing L chain gene recombination in either of these cells, although H-chain expression may have been involved in the initiation of L-chain gene recombination. All ABC-1 cells that have lambda gene rearrangements also display recombined kappa alleles, supporting the hypothesis that kappa and lambda gene recombination are initiated in an ordered, developmentally regulated manner in maturing B cells. However, analyses of the ABC-1 line indicate that pre-B cells that have initiated lambda gene recombination do not terminate kappa gene rearrangement. The lambda gene recombinations that occur in the ABC-1 cell line indicate that the germline order of lambda gene segments is: 5' ... V lambda 2 ... J lambda 2C lambda 2-J lambda 4C lambda 4 ... V lambda 1 ... J lambda 3C lambda 3-J lambda 1C lambda 1 ... 3'. In addition, the frequencies of lambda 1, lambda 2, and lambda 3 gene recombinations among ABC-1 cells are quite different than the frequencies of B cells producing lambda 1, lambda 2, and lambda 3 L-chains in the mouse. RS DNA recombinations also occur in the BM18-4 and ABC-1 cell lines, supporting the notion that Ig gene recombinases are involved in RS rearrangement. Recombined RS segments are infrequent among BM 18-4 cells but common among ABC-1 cells, suggesting that RS recombinational events often occur in maturing pre-B cells just before initiation of lambda gene rearrangements. This developmental timing is consistent with the hypothesis that RS recombination may be involved in the initiation of lambda gene assembly.
1 Murine gamma interferon activates the release of a macrophage-derived Ia-inducing factor that transfers Ia inductive capacity. In this report we demonstrate that when the murine macrophage tumor cell line P- 388D1 is incubated for 48-72 h with either concanavalin A-stimulated rat spleen cell supernatant or cloned murine immune interferon (IFN-gamma), the cultured cells release a cell-free factor activity that in turn induces the cell surface expression of Ia antigen on the murine monocyte cell line WEHI-3. This IFN-gamma-stimulated, Ia-inducing activity cannot be blocked with an anti-IFN-gamma heteroantiserum that does block the induction of Ia expression on WEHI-3 by both cloned murine IFN-gamma and rat Con A supernatant. The Ia-inducing factor ( IaIF ) generated from P- 388D1 after stimulation by IFN-gamma does not demonstrate any antiviral activity. The P- 388D1 -derived IaIF is not shed plasma membrane Ia glycoprotein molecules, as demonstrated by the inability of the active component to bind specifically to an anti-I-Ad affinity column or to a protein A column after the active supernatant is first treated with an excess of anti-I-E/Cd,k monoclonal antibody.
1 Fetuin, an inhibitor of lymphocyte transformation. The interaction of fetuin with phytomitogens and a possible role for fetuin in fetal development. Fetuin, the bovine alpha-fetoprotein, contains glycopeptide sequences similar to those found on red cells. As a result, it is capable of strong physical interaction with the phytohemagglutinin isomitogens (H-PHAP) which possess two or more R (red cell binding) subunits as part of their tetrameric structures. Fetuin shows little or no interaction with L-PHAP, a phytohemagglutinin made up of four L subunits which also lack red cell affinity. Despite these differences fetuin is able to inhibit both H- and L-PHAP-induced lymphocyte transformation and is also capable of inhibiting the mitogenic effects of pokeweed mitogen, concanavalin A, antithymocyte antiserum, and the one-way mixed lymphocyte culture. In the case of L-PHAP, the inhibitory effect of fetuin is proportional to the intensity of the mitogenic stimulus. The inhibitory effects of fetuin upon lymphocyte transformation may result from perturbation or "blindfolding" of the cell membrane in a manner analogous to other immunosuppressive serum alpha-globulins. Alpha-Fetoproteins may play an immunoregulatory role during fetal development.
2 Anti-immunoglobulin-induced histamine secretion by rat peritoneal mast cells studied by immunoferritin electron microscopy. We have used ferritin-conjugated divalent and monovalent anti-Ig antibodies to study simultaneously, histamine secretion and the ultrastructural distribution and redistribution of Ig receptors on rat peritoneal mast cells. We conclude that (a) divalent anti-Ig is required for both receptor redistribution and for calcium-dependent degranulation and histamine release, (b) divalent anti-Ig induces patching and pinocytosis but not capping of Ig molecules, (c) neither capping nor pinocytosis are required for triggering and if clustering is necessary, then less than 10 Ig molecules are required per cluster, and (d) degranulation (and histamine release) is not an all or none response of the mast cell.
3 Location of T cell and major histocompatibility complex antigens in the human thymus. A series of monoclonal antibodies were used to study the intrathymic distribution of T cell-specific antigens, Ia antigens, and beta 2-microglobulin in frozen sections of human thymus by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques. Most of the cortical thymocytes reacted with anti-T4, anti-T5, anti-T6, anti-T8, and anti-T10 antibodies, thus indicating coexpression of multiple antigens on cortical lymphocytes. The staining of cells in the medulla was most satisfactorily judged in sections stained with the immunoperoxidase technique. Many medullary cells reacted with anti-T4--and a smaller fraction with anti-T5, anti-T6, anti-T8, and anti-T10 antibodies. In addition, T1 and T3 antibodies, which react with all peripheral T cells, stained a majority of medullary cells. The medullary cells were also more intensely stained with antibodies directed against beta 2-microglobulin than the majority of cortical cells. Hence, the staining profile of medulla approximates the staining pattern of peripheral T cells, with large numbers of cells bearing T1+, T3+, and T4+ antigens (helper/inducer cells) and a small number of cells bearing T1+, T3+, and T5+/T8+ antigens (suppressor/cytotoxic cells). This supports the conclusion that mature cells present in the medulla are derived from immature cells in the cortex. However, a small number of cells scattered throughout the cortex stained with T1 and T3 antibodies, which suggests that maturation of thymocytes can also occur in the cortex. Antibody directed against Ia antigens resulted in a characteristic patchy pattern of staining in the cortex and in diffuse staining in the medulla, which was interpreted as resulting from staining of epithelial reticulum. The majority of thymocytes did not stain. The staining pattern suggests a close relationship between epithelial cells and thymocytes.
1 Chromosome assignment of the tumor-specific antigen of a 3-methylcholanthrene-induced mouse sarcoma. Chemically induced sarcomas of inbred mice express antigens that are distinct and specific for each individual tumor. Chromosome assignment of tumor-specific antigens would help to elucidate the genetic basis of their diversity. Expression of the serologically defined Meth A sarcoma antigen is not suppressed in hybrid cells containing a complete foreign (Chinese hamster) genome. Chromosome and serologic analysis of microcell hybrids between Meth A sarcoma cells and Chinese hamster cells shows a clear correlation of Meth A antigen expression with the presence of the distal region of chromosome 12 (bands F1 and F2). Chromosome 16 may also be implicated. The significance of the close linkage of genes determining Meth A antigen expression with the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene cluster (on chromosome 12) and the lambda light chain genes (on chromosome 16) is discussed.
3 Murine cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition of individual influenza virus proteins. High frequency of nonresponder MHC class I alleles. We determined the MHC restriction of CTL responses to five individual influenza virus proteins. Four viral proteins failed to be recognized in conjunction with three of the five class I alleles of the H-2k and H-2d haplotypes, while the fifth was recognized only in conjunction with a single allele. This indicates that there is a significant chance that a given class I allele will be associated with low responsiveness or nonresponsiveness for a given foreign protein. This explains, at least in part, why MHC-linked nonresponsiveness is frequently detected in polyclonal antiviral CTL responses. Most importantly, these findings support the idea that responsiveness to foreign antigens is a critical factor in maintaining the high degree of MHC class I polymorphism in outbred populations.
3 Fidelity of the repertoire in T cell reconstituted athymic nude rats. Preservation of a deficit in alloresponsiveness over one year. A single intravenous injection of a relatively small number of T cells contained in the population of rat thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDL) is sufficient to restore to normal the peripheral T cell pool of athymic PVG.rnu/rnu nude rats. The donor T cells expand greater than 10-15-fold, self-renew, and restore immunocompetency to nude recipients permanently (greater than 2 yr). We asked whether the T cell repertoire was affected by the expansion and self-renewal process. Nude recipients were injected with syngeneic PVG TDL that had been allospecifically depleted (negatively selected) by consecutive passage from blood to thoracic duct lymph through two irradiated (DAxPVG)F1 intermediate rats. Negatively selected TDL were tested before transfer by the P----F1 popliteal LN GVH assay and showed a greater than 90% depletion of specific reactivity to DA alloantigens. Surviving cells or their progeny were recovered from LN or TDL of nude recipients 8 and 12 mo after transfer. The deficit in GVH reactivity to the DA haplotype persisted, but normal GVH activity was demonstrated against a third party (AOxPVG)F1 alloantigen. The "hole" in the repertoire could not be attributed to tolerance induced by the co-transfer of contaminating irradiated F1 TDL. PVG TDL passaged consecutively through (AOxPVG)F1 and (DAxPVG)F1 intermediates and devoid of (AOxPVG)F1 cells remained specifically depleted to both AO and DA haplotypes when recovered from nude recipients 4 and 13 mo later, but displayed GVH activity to a third-party (BNxPVG)F1 alloantigen. Thus the exact specificity of the T cell repertoire of the original inoculum was faithfully maintained in nude recipients throughout the initial phase of rapid expansion and the continued self-renewal of the mature peripheral T cell pool.
3 Fc gamma RII/III and CD2 expression mark distinct subpopulations of immature CD4-CD8- murine thymocytes: in vivo developmental kinetics and T cell receptor beta chain rearrangement status. We have recently identified a dominant wave of CD4-CD8- (double-negative [DN]) thymocytes in early murine fetal development that express low affinity Fc gamma receptors (Fc gamma RII/III) and contain precursors for Ti alpha/beta lineage T cells. Here we show that Fc gamma RII/III is expressed in very immature CD4low single-positive (SP) thymocytes and that Fc gamma RII/III expression is downregulated within the DN subpopulation and before the CD3-CD8low SP stage in T cell receptor (TCR)-alpha/beta lineage-committed thymocytes. DN Fc gamma RII/III+ thymocytes also contain a small fraction of TCR-gamma/delta lineage cells in addition to TCR-alpha/beta progenitors. Fetal day 15.5 DN TCR-alpha/beta lineage progenitors can be subdivided into three major subpopulations as characterized by cell surface expression of Fc gamma RII/III vs. CD2 (Fc gamma RII/III+CD2-, Fc gamma RII/III+CD2+, Fc gamma RII/III-CD2+). Phenotypic analysis during fetal development as well as adoptive transfer of isolated fetal thymocyte subpopulations derived from C57B1/6 (Ly5.1) mice into normal, nonirradiated Ly5.2 congenic recipient mice identifies one early differentiation sequence (Fc gamma RII/III+CD2(-)-->Fc gamma RII/III+CD2(+)-->Fc gamma RII/III-CD2+) that precedes the entry of DN thymocytes into the CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) TCRlow/- stage. Unseparated day 15.5 fetal thymocytes develop into DP thymocytes within 2.5 d and remain at the DP stage for > 48 h before being selected into either CD4+ or CD8+ SP thymocytes. In contrast, Fc gamma RII/III+CD2- DN thymocytes follow this same developmental pathway but are delayed by approximately 24 h before entering the DP compartment, while Fc gamma RII/III-CD2+ display accelerated development by approximately 24 h compared with total day 15.5 thymocytes. Fc gamma RII/III-CD2+ are also more developmentally advanced than Fc gamma RII/III+CD2- fetal thymocytes with respect to their TCR beta chain V(D)J rearrangement. At day 15.5 in gestation, beta chain V(D)J rearrangement is mostly, if not entirely, restricted to the Fc gamma RII/III-CD2+ subset of DN fetal thymocytes. Consistent with this analysis in fetal thymocytes, > 90% of adult thymocytes derived from mice carrying a disrupting mutation at the recombination-activating gene 2 locus (RAG-2-/-) on both alleles are developmentally arrested at the DN CD2- stage. In addition, there is a fivefold increase in the relative percentage of thymocytes expressing Fc gamma RII/III in TCR and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement-incompetent homozygous RAG-2-/- mice (15% Fc gamma RII/III+) versus rearrangement-competent heterozygous RAG-2+/- mice (< 3% Fc gamma RII/III+). Thus, Fc gamma RII/III expression defines an early DN stage preceding V beta(D beta)I beta rearrangement, which in turn is followed by surface expression of CD2. Loss of Fc gamma RII/III and acquisition of CD2 expression characterize a late DN stage immediately before the conversion into DP thymocytes.
1 A host gene regulates the structure of the transmembrane envelope protein of murine leukemia viruses. Heterogeneity in the structure of the envelope proteins has been observed in many human and animal retroviruses and may influence pathogenicity. However, the biological significance of this heterogeneity and the mechanisms by which it is generated are poorly understood. We have studied a mouse model in which the envelope gene structure of lymphoma-associated viruses appears to be controlled by a single host gene. The inoculation of HRS and CWD mice with a leukemogenic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) results in recombination between the injected virus and envelope gene sequences of endogenous retroviruses. The genomes of HRS (class I) env recombinants and CWD (class II) env recombinants differ in the sequences encoding the NH2-terminal portion of the transmembrane envelope protein (TM). We have shown that an HRS gene linked to the MHC on chromosome 17 mediates a dominant selection for recombinant retroviruses with the class I envelope gene structure. CBA mice, which share the H-2k haplotype with HRS, also carry the dominant allele at this locus. This system provides a useful model for studies of host factors involved in the selection of specific variants of pathogenic retroviruses.
0 DNA rearrangement and constitutive expression of the interleukin 6 gene in a mouse plasmacytoma. To study the potential involvement of IL-6 in the development of plasmacytomas, a number of plasmacytoma lines were analyzed for alterations in the IL-6 locus. A DNA rearrangement due to the insertion of an intracisternal A particle retrotransposon 18 bp 5' of the transcriptional start site was detected in the cell line MPC11. The IL-6 gene is constitutively expressed in MPC11, suggesting the involvement of IL-6 in the development of certain myeloma/plasmacytomas according to the "autocrine growth hypothesis".
1 Antigenic heterogeneity of gonococcal pili. Pili were isolated from two different strains of gonococci (33 and 2686) and demonstrated to be pure by the criteria of electron microscopy and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Each purified pili preparation was studied for its ability to inhibit; (a) binding of 124-I-labeled purified 2686 pili by antibody to 2686 pili, and (b) binding of 125-I-labeled purified 33 pili by antibody to 33 pili. In each instance progressive inhibition of binding was produced by homologous pili type, but no significant inhibition was observed using comparable weights of the heterologous pili type. These results indicate that the pili of strains 2686 and 33 are antigenically different.
3 Regulation of murine macrophage Ia-antigen expression by products of activated spleen cells. This investigation examined the effects of mediators derived form activated spleen cells on macrophage Ia-antigen expression and function. Incubation of adherent thioglycollate-induced murine peritoneal macrophages(> 90% Ia-) with concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated spleen cell supernate (Con A sup) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of Ia-containing (Ia+) phagocytic cells, as detected by antiserum-and-complement-mediated cytotoxicity. The Ia-antigen expression of macrophages incubated with unstimulated spleen cell supernate supplemented with Con A (Control sup) declined. Pretreatment of the macrophages with anti-Ia and complement before addition of the Con A sup did not inhibit subsequent Ia-antigen expression, suggesting that Ia- macropohages were converted to Ia+ cells. These findings were not a result of adsorption of soluble Ia-antigen from the Con A sup, because Ia-antigen expression was detected by an antiserum specific for the haplotype of the macrophages but not that of the allogeneic spleen cells from which the supernate was prepared. Con A sup-cultured macrophages also stimulated the proliferation of allogeneic spleen cells significantly better than Control sup-cultured macrophages in the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). Pretreatment of Con A sup-cultured macrophages with anti-Ia and complement before addition of splenic responder cells abrogated their stimulatory capacity, indicating the Ia dependence of the MLR. We hypothesize that regulatory lymphokine(s) can induce both the expression of the Ia+ phenotype by macrophages and the functional capability to stimulate the MLR, and that macrophages lose these capabilities in the absence of such mediator(s).
3 Independent regulation of Ca2+ entry and release from internal stores in activated B cells. Addition of crosslinking antibody to B lymphocytes results in a rapid rise in cytoplasmic-free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) due to release of Ca2+ from internal stores and uptake of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is believed to mediate the release of internal Ca2+ stores and has also been proposed to mediate extracellular Ca2+ entry. We have compared the properties of these two pathways for Ca2+ mobilization by dissociating the [Ca2+]i changes in ligand-activated human B cells after loading of the cells with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. In the present paper we show that: (a) the sustained increase in [Ca2+]i is due to increased unidirectional influx of external [Ca2+]i; (b) entry of extracellular Ca2+, but not release of internal stores, is sensitive to the transmembrane potential; and (c) entry of extracellular Ca2+, but not release of internal stores, is inhibited by increasing [Ca2+]i. These findings suggest that the permeation pathways mediating the translocation of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum membrane are not identical.
3 B lymphocyte immune response gene phenotype is genetically determined. We examined the effects of the developmental milieu on the capacity of B cells to undergo immune response gene-controlled, T cell-dependent polyclonal proliferation. Although I-Aq poly(Glu60 Ala30 Tyr10)n (GAT)-nonresponder T cells developing in a responder environment become phenotypic GAT-responders, I-Aq B cells remain unresponsive to GAT, even after maturation in a GAT-responder animal. Conversely, (B10.A x B10.Q)F1 ([GAT responder x GAT nonresponder]F1) T cells developing in a B10.Q GAT nonresponder host fail to respond to GAT, but F1 B cells from the same F1 leads to parent chimeras make excellent proliferative responses in the presence of GAT and responder T cells. Thus, by this assay, B cell immune response gene function is genetically determined and is not affected by the developmental milieu.
0 Ankyrin-Tiam1 interaction promotes Rac1 signaling and metastatic breast tumor cell invasion and migration. Tiam1 (T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1) is one of the known guanine nucleotide (GDP/GTP) exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho GTPases (e.g., Rac1) and is expressed in breast tumor cells (e.g., SP-1 cell line). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses indicate that Tiam1 and the cytoskeletal protein, ankyrin, are physically associated as a complex in vivo. In particular, the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of ankyrin is responsible for Tiam1 binding. Biochemical studies and deletion mutation analyses indicate that the 11-amino acid sequence between amino acids 717 and 727 of Tiam1 ((717)GEGTDAVKRS(727)L) is the ankyrin-binding domain. Most importantly, ankyrin binding to Tiam1 activates GDP/GTP exchange on Rho GTPases (e.g., Rac1). Using an Escherichia coli-derived calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP)-tagged recombinant Tiam1 (amino acids 393-728) fragment that contains the ankyrin-binding domain, we have detected a specific binding interaction between the Tiam1 (amino acids 393-738) fragment and ankyrin in vitro. This Tiam1 fragment also acts as a potent competitive inhibitor for Tiam1 binding to ankyrin. Transfection of SP-1 cell with Tiam1 cDNAs stimulates all of the following: (1) Tiam1-ankyrin association in the membrane projection; (2) Rac1 activation; and (3) breast tumor cell invasion and migration. Cotransfection of SP1 cells with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Tiam1 fragment cDNA and Tiam1 cDNA effectively blocks Tiam1-ankyrin colocalization in the cell membrane, and inhibits GDP/GTP exchange on Rac1 by ankyrin-associated Tiam1 and tumor-specific phenotypes. These findings suggest that ankyrin-Tiam1 interaction plays a pivotal role in regulating Rac1 signaling and cytoskeleton function required for oncogenic signaling and metastatic breast tumor cell progression.
3 Rearrangement and expression of T cell receptor genes in cloned murine natural suppressor cell lines. Naturally occurring suppressor cells of the in vitro mixed leukocyte culture reaction and of in vivo graft-vs.-host disease have been identified in the spleens of neonatal mice (1) and of adult mice recovering from total lymphoid irradiation (2), whole-body irradiation (3), and syngeneic marrow transplantation (4), or cyclophosphamide therapy (5). Using both positive and negative selection procedures, the suppressors were reported to be null lymphocytes that did not express mature macrophage surface markers, nor differentiate into mature macrophages in vitro, nor demonstrate natural killer (NK) activity (1). Subsequently, cloned lines of these natural suppressor (NS) cells were derived from either adult mice given total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) (2) or from neonates (6). The cloned NS cell lines expressed a surface phenotype (2, 6) similar to that reported previously for cloned NK cells (Thy-1(+), asialo-GM1(+), Ig(-), Lyt-1(-), Lyt-2(-), Ia(-), MAC-1(-)) (7-9). However, the NS cells did not show NK activity in the standard assay with YAC-1 target cells. The cloned NS lines suppressed the proliferation of responder cells and the generation of cytolytic cells in the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR), and suppressed lethal graft-vs.-host disease in vivo (10, 11). In view of the unusual function and surface phenotype of the cells, the lineage of these cells remained unclear. To determine the lineage of the cloned NS cells, we searched for expression and rearrangement of the alpha and beta chain genes of the T cell antigen receptor, as well as that of the gamma chain gene. Studies of the phenotypically similar NK cell yielded conflicting results. Thus, cloned lines of murine NK cells were reported to have rearrangements of the beta chain genes, and to express mRNA for all three chains (12). In contrast, freshly purified rat or human large granular lymphocytes (LGL) were shown to express only the 1.0 kb mRNA species of the beta chain gene (13), indicative of D-J joining (14). Thus, some but not all cells with NK function express the T cell receptor and are members of the T cell lineage. The current report shows that the NS lines express full-length mRNA transcripts for the a and beta chain of the T cell receptor, as well as the gamma chain gene.
0 Molecular basis of reovirus virulence. Role of the M2 gene. The mammalian reoviruses (serotype 1, strain Lang and serotype 3, strain Dearing) differ in their sensitivity to digestion by chymotrypsin. We have found that the M2 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome segment (encoding the micro1C outer capsid polypeptide) is responsible for this property. In addition to determining response to protease treatement in vitro, we have found that the M2 genome segment also determines the ability of these two viruses successfully to initiate local and systemic infection in newborn mice after peroral inoculation. Thus the M2 dsRNA segment defines a new virulence gene of the mammalian reoviruses.
1 A second chain of human CD8 is expressed on peripheral blood lymphocytes. Human CD8 has been thought to consist of disulfide-linked homodimers and homomultimers of a single polypeptide chain homologous to mouse and rat CD8 alpha. In contrast, mouse and rat CD8 are composed of disulfide-linked heterodimers of alpha and beta chains. We have now isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding a human homologue of mouse and rat CD8 beta. One such clone was inserted into an expression vector and its encoded product was shown to be expressed on the cell surface after cotransfection into L cells with the human CD8 alpha gene. A second form of human CD8 beta cDNA encoding a protein with an altered cytoplasmic tail was similarly transfected, but its product could not be demonstrated on the cell surface. CD8 beta was further shown to be expressed on the surface of almost all CD8+ human peripheral blood T cells. These data provide the first evidence that human CD8 is a heterodimeric protein.
3 Radioimmune analysis of an unexpected mouse allotype. We have used a radioimmune assay to confirm our earlier findings of an unexpected immunoglobulin allotype in Igb-congenic BALB/c mice. Although these mice were bred to exclude the IgG2a allotype of BALB/c (Ig-la), an Ig-la-like antigen was detected in the 7S Ig fraction of two (of five) pooled serum samples, it represented 0.1--0.3% of the total 7S protein and was indistinguishable from a reference Ig-la. The detection of putative Ig-la in Igb-congenic mice is inconsistent with the notion that allotypes are products of allelic structural genes. It appears rather that expression of Ig-la is controlled by allelic regulator genes and that its low and transient production in Igb-congenic mice results from incomplete negative regulation.
3 Protein particles in Chlamydomonas flagella undergo a transport cycle consisting of four phases. We used an improved procedure to analyze the intraflagellar transport (IFT) of protein particles in Chlamydomonas and found that the frequency of the particles, not only the velocity, changes at each end of the flagella. Thus, particles undergo structural remodeling at both flagellar locations. Therefore, we propose that the IFT consists of a cycle composed of at least four phases: phases II and IV, in which particles undergo anterograde and retrograde transport, respectively, and phases I and III, in which particles are remodeled/exchanged at the proximal and distal end of the flagellum, respectively. In support of our model, we also identified 13 distinct mutants of flagellar assembly (fla), each defective in one or two consecutive phases of the IFT cycle. The phase I-II mutant fla10-1 revealed that cytoplasmic dynein requires the function of kinesin II to participate in the cycle. Phase I and II mutants accumulate complex A, a particle component, near the basal bodies. In contrast, phase III and IV mutants accumulate complex B, a second particle component, in flagellar bulges. Thus, fla mutations affect the function of each complex at different phases of the cycle.
3 Murine interleukin 7 (IL-7) receptor. Characterization on an IL-7-dependent cell line. A murine cell line (IxN/2b) absolutely dependent upon exogenous IL-7 for continued growth has been obtained that expresses lymphoid precursor and class I MHC antigens and also contains a rearranged mu heavy chain. This cell line has been used to define the binding and structural characteristics of the murine IL-7 receptor using 125I-labeled recombinant murine IL-7. 125I-IL-7 binding to IxN/2b cell was rapid and saturable at both 4 degrees and 37 degrees C. Equilibrium binding studies produced curvilinear Scatchard plots at both temperatures with high and low affinity Ka values of approximately 1 x 10(10) M-1 and 4 x 10(8) M-1, respectively, and a total of 2,000-2,500 IL-7 binding sites expressed per cell. Experiments measuring inhibition of binding of 125I-IL-7 by unlabeled IL-7 also produced data consistent with the existence of two classes of IL-7 receptors. Evidence concerning the possible molecular nature of two classes of IL-7 receptors was provided by dissociation kinetics and affinity crosslinking experiments. The dissociation rate of 125I-IL-7 was markedly increased when measured in the presence of unlabeled IL-7 at both 37 degrees and 4 degrees C, which is diagnostic of a receptor population displaying negative cooperativity. Crosslinking studies showed that under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, the major crosslinked species observed corresponded to a receptor size of 75-79 kD while a less intense higher molecular mass crosslinked species was also seen which corresponded to a receptor size approximately twice as large (159-162 kD). Both types of experiments suggest that the IL-7 receptor may form noncovalently associated dimers in the membrane. The IL-7 receptor was expressed on pre-B cells, but not detected on several murine B cell lines or primary mature B cells. It was also expressed on murine thymocytes, some T lineage cell lines, and on bone marrow-derived macrophage. All cells binding 125I-IL-7 exhibited curvilinear Scatchard plots. No cytokines or growth factors tested were able to inhibit binding of 125I-IL-7 to its receptor. These results define the initial binding and structural characteristics, and the cellular distribution, of the murine IL-7 receptor.
0 Regulation of granulomatous inflammation in murine schistosomiasis. In vitro characterization of T lymphocyte subsets involved in the production and suppression of migration inhibition factor. Host granulomatous inflammation in murine schistosomiasis mansoni is a T cell-mediated immune response, which, at the chronic stage of the disease, undergoes T suppressor lymphocyte-dependent modulation. In the present study this phenomenon was further analyzed in vitro. Spleen cells of mice undergoing modulation (20 wk of infection) when mixed with spleen cells of animals exhibiting vigorous granulomatous responses (8 wk of infection) abrogated in vitro migration inhibition factor (MIF) production by the latter. Characterization of the delayed-type hypersensitivity T lymphocytes involved in lymphokine production showed that they belonged to the Lyt-1+ subset and did not express I region-encoded antigens. In contrast, T lymphocytes involved in the suppression of MIF activity belonged to the Lyt-2+ subpopulation of cells, which expressed I-J- and I-C-subregion determinants. These results suggest that the modulation of the granulomatous hypersensitivity response in mice is the result of T-T cell interaction with subsequent regulation of inflammatory lymphokine production.
0 Infection of rabbits with human immunodeficiency virus 1. A small animal model for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Injection of rabbits with a human T cell line infected with HIV-1 caused seroconversion within 6 wk, and HIV-1 could be isolated from PBL cultures of infected rabbits. Identity of the isolated virus with HIV-1 was shown by analysis of products amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. HIV-1 infection was seen in rabbits injected with HIV-1-infected cells alone as well as in those that were first infected with HTLV-1 and subsequently with HIV-1. There were no consistent signs of disease in the rabbits infected with HIV-1 alone but HTLV-1/HIV-1-infected rabbits showed signs of illness including diarrhea and weight loss, transient neurologic impairment and, in one animal, a rapidly progressing mammary adenocarcinoma. Examination of organs taken at necropsy from both HIV-1- and HTLV-1/HIV-1-infected animals showed splenic hyperplasia and lymphocyte infiltration of the lungs, as well as moderate damage to liver and kidney in some cases.
3 Production of a B cell growth-promoting activity, (DL)BCGF, from a cloned T cell line and its assay on the BCL1 B cell tumor. Culture supernatants from a long-term alloreactive T cell line, the Dennert line C.C3.11.75 (DL) contain a B cell-growth-promoting activity. This activity can be assayed on normal B cells or on the in vivo BCL1 tumor line. We have called this activity (DL)BCGF. This activity can be distinguished from the T cell-replacing factor activity we had earlier found in DL supernates [(DL)TRF], which is required together with IL2 for the B cell plaque-forming cell response to erythrocyte antigens. The (DL)BCGF can be absorbed on untreated or glutaraldehyde-fixed BCL1. This absorption does not remove (DL)TRF activity. The production of (DL)BCGF is greatly enhanced when DL is cultured with IL2-containing supernatants. Sublines or clones of DL (DL.B10 and DL.A4) have been obtained that make large amounts of (DL)BCGF in the absence of any stimulator cells or IL2. B cells from the Xid-deficient male (DBA/2 X CBA/N)F1 mice do not respond to (DL)BCGF.
3 Biochemical nature of an Fc mu receptor on human B-lineage cells. An IgM-binding protein of approximately 60 kD has been identified on activated B cells, but not on resting and activated T cells, monocytes, or granulocytes. Here, we characterize this IgM-binding protein as a receptor for the Fc portion (CH3 and/or CH4 domains) of IgM molecules (Fc microR). The Fc microR can be expressed as a cell surface activation antigen throughout the pre-B and B cell stages in differentiation. Receptor expression is not directly linked with IgM production, as both mu- pre-B cells and isotype-switched B cells may express the Fc microR. The receptor molecules produced by both pre-B and B cells are identical in size and are characterized as an acidic sialoglycoprotein with O-linked, but no N-linked, oligosaccharide. The Fc microR is anchored to the surface of B-lineage cells via a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol linkage. The Fc microR is thus the third member of a family of Fc receptors expressed on B-lineage cells, and its preferential expression on activated B cells suggests a potential role in the response to antigens.
0 Evidence for a new segregant series of B cell antigens that are encoded in the HLA-D region and that stimulate secondary allogenic proliferative and cytotoxic responses. Five new histocompatibility antigens, designated secondary B cell or (SB) antigens, have been identified by secondary allogeneic proliferative and cytotoxic responses. The reagents used to define the SB antigents are lymphocytes primed between donors matched for all known HLA antigens. The SB antigens stimulate weak primary allogeneic proliferative responses (a mean relative response of 8%) but strong secondary proliferative responses. Strong secondary cell-mediated cytotoxicity is generated against target antigens that are distinguishable from the SB antigens defined by proliferation. Studies by direct lysis and by cold-target inhibition indicate that these target antigens are preferentially expressed on B cells relative to T cells. The SB antigens segregate with HLA, and the gene(s) encoding the SB1, 3, and 4 antigens maps centromeric to HLA-B. The SB antigens are major histocompatibility antigens not only because they are encoded by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, but also by the functional criteria that the proliferative and cytotoxic responses to SB antigens are not restricted by HLA-DR or HLA-A,-B. Parallel studies of the SB antigens and the DR antigens with respect to: (a) their preferential expression on B cells, (b) their function in secondary allogeneic proliferative and cytotoxic respones, and (c) the location of their structural gene within the MHC. However, the SB antigens and the DR antigens are clearly distinct antigens, because population studies indicate that they can occur independently, and family studies indicate that specific SB antigens segregate with HLA haplotypes having different D and DR specificities. Our data are consistent with the hypotheses that the SB antigens are a new segregant series of B cell alloantigens, and that the SB gene and the DR gene derive from a duplicated ancestral gene.
3 Monoreactive high affinity and polyreactive low affinity rheumatoid factors are produced by CD5+ B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), circulating CD5+ B lymphocytes, but not CD5- B lymphocytes, are increased in number and size, exist in an activated state, spontaneously proliferate, and secrete Ig that binds to the Fc fragment of IgG. By constructing continuous mAb-secreting cell lines from CD5+ B lymphocytes, the properties and dissociation constants (Kd) of these antibodies were determined. Two types of rheumatoid factors (RFs) with discrete reactivities were produced. The first type is polyreactive and binds with relatively low affinity (Kd, 10(-5) mol/liter) to the Fc fragment of IgG. These antibodies are similar to those produced by CD5+ B cells from healthy subjects. The second type of RF is monoreactive and binds with higher affinity (Kd, 10(-7) mol/liter) to the Fc fragment of IgG. These latter autoantibodies are produced by CD5+ B cells of RA patients, but not healthy subjects. Long-term longitudinal studies are needed to determine the role of these two types of RFs in the pathogenesis of RA.
1 Localization of eosinophil granule major basic protein in human basophils. In experiments using an immunofluorescent method to localize human eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP) in cells and tissues, a small number of cells stained for MBP that subsequently could not be identified as eosinophils. Because the Charcot-Leyden crystal protein, another eosinophil protein, was recently identified in basophils, we tested whether MBP might also be a constituent of blood basophils. Highly purified, eosinophil-free basophil suspensions were prepared using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to sort basophil-containing mononuclear cell preparations stained with fluorescein-conjugated sheep IgG anti-human IgE antibody. Using these FACS-purified basophils, we found that: (a) enrichment for surface IgE-positive cells (greater than 95% basophils) by FACS also enriched for cells staining for MBP by immunofluorescence; (b) MBP appeared to be localized in the histamine-, heparin-containing granules; (c) significant quantities of MBP were measurable by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in freeze-thaw detergent extracts of purified basophils; and (d) RIA dose-response curves for extracts of purified eosinophils and basophils had identical slopes. The MBP content of basophils from normal individuals averaged 140 ng/10(6) cells, whereas purified eosinophils from normal donors and patients with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome averaged 4,979 and 824 ng/10(6) cells, respectively. MBP was also detected by immunofluorescence and RIA in cells obtained from a patient with basophil leukemia, although the MBP content for basophil leukemia cells was lower than that for normal basophils. We conclude that basophils contain a protein that is immunochemically indistinguishable from eosinophil granule MBP.
1 Proteolytic enzyme treatment reduces glomerular immune deposits and proteinuria in passive Heymann nephritis. We investigated the effect of proteolytic enzyme treatment on the course of passive Heymann nephritis (PHN). PHN was induced by intravenous injection of Heymann antibody into Sprague Dawley rats. Protease-treated rats received intraperitoneal chymopapain and subtilisin. In rats given subnephritogenic doses of Heymann antibody (5 or 10 mg, insufficient to cause proteinuria), glomerular immune deposits were assessed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. In rats given 5 mg Heymann antibody and treated with protease in the heterologous phase of the disease (days 1-7), fewer animals were positive for rabbit IgG and rat IgG, as determined by immunofluorescence on day 12, compared with controls (p less than 0.01). Rats given 10 mg Heymann antibody and treated on days 1-5 were less frequently positive for rabbit IgG on day 5 than controls (p less than 0.05). When treatment was given on days 6-12 (autologous phase), fewer rats had glomerular rabbit and rat IgG compared with controls (p less than 0.025). Protease treatment of rats given nephritogenic doses of Heymann antibody (greater than or equal to 40 mg, causing proteinuria) did not result in significant differences in immunofluorescence deposits. However, protease treatment significantly reduced the number of electron dense deposits at all doses of antibody (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, rats given 60 mg Heymann antibody followed by enzyme treatment in the heterologous phase (days 1-7) or throughout the autologous phase (days 6-18) had significantly reduced protein excretion during the autologous phase compared with control rats (p less than 0.05). After onset of significant proteinuria on day 15 in rats given 40 mg Heymann antibody and treated from day 15 until day 25, there was significantly less (p less than 0.05) proteinuria on days 21-22 and 24-25 than in control rats; thus, enzymes could reverse proteinuria. In normal rats, administration of proteases did not have significant effects on urinary protein excretion, serum creatinine, or renal morphology, nor did protease affect anti-rabbit IgG antibody production in rats injected with Heymann antibody. The overall results indicate that proteolytic enzyme treatment can prevent or remove glomerular immune deposits and can prevent or reverse proteinuria.
0 Tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulates the growth of the clonogenic cells of acute myeloblastic leukemia in synergy with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. TNF-alpha has been shown to antagonize the proliferative effects of growth factors present in crude conditioned media from PHA-stimulated leukocytes or cell lines on the clonogenic cells of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) (19,21). In the present study, we investigated the responses of AML blasts to TNF-alpha in the presence of defined growth factors (recombinant granulocyte/macrophage-CSF [rGM-CSF], recombinant granulocyte-CSF [rG-CSF], rIL-3, and rIL-1) and under conditions described for autocrine stimulation (32). While TNF-alpha antagonized the stimulatory effects of G-CSF and IL-3 on blast progenitors, TNF-alpha did not affect blast colony formation in the presence of IL-1. Unexpectedly, TNF-alpha significantly enhanced blast proliferation in the presence of GM-CSF. Further, TNF-alpha also acted synergistically with an endogenous source of growth stimulatory signal to promote proliferation of blast clonogenic cells. Thus, on human leukemic cells, TNF-alpha appears to be a molecule that is at least bifunctional, having the ability to either support or inhibit cell proliferation, depending on the other growth factors present. It is postulated that the proliferative response of blast progenitors to TNF-alpha under conditions that favor autocrine stimulation may represent one property that allows the cells to escape from negative regulation and proliferate in AML.
3 Mediation systems in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced hypotension and disseminated intravascular coagulation. I. The role of complement. We have studied the role of complement in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hypotension and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) by comparing the effects of injection of three preparations of LPS from E. Coli 0111:B4, S. minnesota Re595, and S. marcescens. Injections of nonlethal doses of these LPS preparations into normal rabbits produced decreases in mean arterial blood pressure during a 5-h period. When rabbits treated with cobra venom factor (CoF) to deplete C3 were injected with the various LPS preparations, mean arterial pressures fell at a rate and extent essentially identical to that observed in normal rabbits. Rabbits genetically deficient in C6 also demonstrated LPS-induced hypotensive changes. Only minimal, or no changes in plasma C3 levels or serum CH50 values were detected in normal rabbits after LPS injection. Hypotensive changes were also induced in rabbits when complement was rapidly activated by intravenous injection of CoF. In contrast to the hypotension induced by LPS, the fall in arterial pressure associated with the consumption of complement was short lived and required the rapid consumption of considerable amounts of C3. The occurrence of DIC noted in normal rabbits injected with each preparation of LPS was not inhibited in either rabbits treated with cobra factor or in C6-deficient rabbits. The DIC was most pronounced after injection of Re595 and S. marcescens LPS. Injection of the various LPS preparations produced a rapid disappearance of circulating neutrophils and mononuclear cells, which occurred with the same kinetics and to the same extent in normal, CoF-treated, and C6-deficient rabbits. Injection of either Re595 LPS or S. marcescens LPS produced a biphasic disappearance of circulating 51Cr-platelets. In contrast, injection of 0111:B4 LPS affected only slightly the rate of disappearance of 51Cr-platelets. Depletion of C3 by cobra factor treatment had no effect on the disappearance of platelets in animals injected with 0111:B4. In marked contrast cobra factor treatment greatly reduced the initial rapid disappearance of platelets in rabbits injected with either Re595 or S. marcescens LPS, but had no effect in the secondary disappearance phase.
3 Dietary fish oil modulates macrophage fatty acids and decreases arthritis susceptibility in mice. B10.RIII and B10.G mice were transferred from a diet of laboratory rodent chow to a standard diet in which all the fat (5% by weight) was supplied as either fish oil (17% eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], 12% docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], 0% arachidonic acid [AA], and 2% linoleic acid) or corn oil (0% EPA, 0% DHA, 0% AA, and 65% linoleic acid). The fatty acid composition of the macrophage phospholipids from mice on the chow diet was similar to that of mice on a corn oil diet. Mice fed the fish oil diet for only 1 wk showed substantial increases in macrophage phospholipid levels of the omega-3 fatty acids (of total fatty acid 4% was EPA, 10% docosapentaenoic acid [DPA], and 10% DHA), and decreases in omega-6 fatty acids (12% was AA, 2% docosatetraenoic acid [DTA], and 4% linoleic acid) compared to corn oil-fed mice (0% EPA, 0% DPA, 6% DHA, 20% AA, 9% DTA, and 8% linoleic acid). After 5 wk this difference between the fish oil-fed and corn oil-fed mice was even more pronounced. Further small changes occurred at 5-9 wk. We studied the prostaglandin (PG) and thromboxane (TX) profile of macrophages prepared from mice fed the two diets just before being immunized with collagen. Irrespective of diet, macrophages prepared from female mice and incubated for 24 h had significantly more PG and TX in the medium than similarly prepared macrophages from male mice. The increased percentage of EPA and decreased percentage of AA in the phospholipids of the macrophages prepared from the fish oil-fed mice was reflected in a reduction in the amount of PGE2 and PGI2 in the medium relative to identically incubated macrophages prepared from corn oil-fed mice. When this same fish oil diet was fed to B10.RIII mice for 26 d before immunization with type II collagen, the time of onset of arthritis was increased, and the incidence and severity of arthritis was reduced compared to arthritis induced in corn oil-fed mice. The females, especially those on the fish oil diet, tended to have less arthritis than the males. These alterations in the fatty acid pool available for PG and leukotriene synthesis suggest a pivotal role for the macrophage and PG in the immune and/or inflammatory response to type II collagen.
0 Structure and expression of human IgG FcRII(CD32). Functional heterogeneity is encoded by the alternatively spliced products of multiple genes. The structural heterogeneity of the human low affinity receptor for IgG, FcRII(CD32), has been elucidated through the isolation, characterization, and expression of cDNA clones derived from myeloid and lymphoid RNA. These clones predict amino acid sequences consistent with integral membrane glycoproteins with single membrane spanning domains. The extracellular domains display sequence homology to other Fc gamma Rs and members of the Ig supergene family. A minimum of three genes (Fc gamma RIIa, IIa', and Fc gamma RIIb) encode these transcripts, which demonstrate highly related extracellular and membrane spanning domains. IIa/IIa' differ substantially in the intracytoplasmic domain from IIb. Alternative splicing of the IIb gene generates further heterogeneity in both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the predicted proteins. Comparison to the murine homologues of these molecules reveals a high degree of conservation between the products of one of these genes, Fc gamma RIIb, and the murine beta gene in primary sequence, splicing pattern, and tissue distribution. In contrast, the sequence of IIa' indicates its relationship to the beta-like genes, with mutation giving rise to a novel cytoplasmic domain, while IIa is a chimera of both alpha- and beta-like genes. Expression of these cDNA molecules by transfection results in the appearance of IgG binding molecules that bear the epitopes defined by the FcRII(CD32) mAbs previously described.
0 H-2K mutation controls immune response phenotype of autoimmune thyroiditis. Critical expression of mutant gene product in both thymus and thyroid glands. Autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) can be induced by immunizing mice against mouse thyroglobulin. A gene critical to the phenotypical expression of EAT was mapped to the H-2K locus by studying B6 mice and its mutant strain B6.H-2ba. To identify organs in which expression of the gene was decisive for the EAT phenotype, we transplanted thyroid or irradiated thymus glands into various strains of normal mice or thymusless nude mice. We found that the pathophysiology of EAT was controlled by the expression of specific H-2 genes in both the target thyroid gland and the thymus gland.
1 Interleukin 1 potentiates the lethal effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha/cachectin in mice. Human rIL-1 alpha and human rIL-1 beta were examined for their ability to potentiate the lethal and hypothermic effects of mouse rTNF-alpha in mice. The LD50 of rTNF-alpha was 1.5 micrograms/mouse, whereas the LD50 of rTNF-alpha was reduced to 0.4 micrograms/mouse and 0.5 micrograms/mouse when rTNF-alpha was administered in combination with a nonlethal dose of rIL-1 alpha or rIL-1 beta, respectively. A similar rTNF-alpha enhancing effect of the rIL-1 was observed on the temperature response. The results show that the rIL-1 markedly potentiate the effects of rTNF-alpha on lethality and temperature in mice, and support our suggestion that TNF-alpha and IL-1 may have synergistic lethal effect in human septic shock.
3 Synthetic Fc peptide-mediated regulation of the immune response. I. Characterization of the immunomodulating properties of a synthetic 23-amino acid peptide derived from the sequence of the CH3 domain of human IgG1. A synthetic 23-amino acid peptide derived from the CH3 domain of human IgG1 was found to be a potent adjuvant as well as a polyclonal activator. The Fc peptide was found to enhance human and murine humoral, and T cell-mediated immune responses. Moreover, in vivo administration of Fc peptide enhanced murine natural killer cell activity. The synthetic Fc peptide was found to be more potent, on a molar basis, than native Fc fragments in inducing polyclonal antibody production and potentiating immune responses.
3 A novel, NH2-terminal sequence-characterized human monokine possessing neutrophil chemotactic, skin-reactive, and granulocytosis-promoting activity. A factor able to induce an early local inflammation in rabbit skin was detected in the supernatant of mitogen-stimulated human blood leukocytes. The factor was different from IL-1 which, although present in the supernatants, was chemically separable from the factor and induced a late rather than an early skin response. Other biological effects of the principal factor were its in vitro chemotactic effects on granulocytes and its ability to induce rapid granulocytosis upon intravenous injection in rabbits. When tested under the same conditions, IL-1 beta did not act chemotactically and induced granulocytosis at a later time. The factor was purified to homogeneity and identified by electrophoretic mobility as a protein of Mr 6,500. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of an uncontaminated NH2-terminal sequence identical to a segment of the sequence previously predicted from the cDNA clone (3-10C) copied from an mRNA isolated from human leukocytes and coding for a protein of unknown function. The NH2-terminal sequence of the factor also showed extensive homology to that of the platelet factors beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF-4). Studies done to identify the cell source of the factor revealed that it was produced by adherent mononuclear cells but not by platelets, while the opposite was true for beta TG.
2 Caloric restriction and genomic stability. Caloric restriction (CR) reduces the incidence and progression of spontaneous and induced tumors in laboratory rodents while increasing mean and maximum life spans. It has been suggested that CR extends longevity and reduces age-related pathologies by reducing the levels of DNA damage and mutations that accumulate with age. This hypothesis is attractive because the integrity of the genome is essential to a cell/organism and because it is supported by observations that both cancer and immunological defects, which increase significantly with age and are delayed by CR, are associated with changes in DNA damage and/or DNA repair. Over the last three decades, numerous laboratories have examined the effects of CR on the integrity of the genome and the ability of cells to repair DNA. The majority of studies performed indicate that the age-related increase in oxidative damage to DNA is significantly reduced by CR. Early studies suggest that CR reduces DNA damage by enhancing DNA repair. With the advent of genomic technology and our increased understanding of specific repair pathways, CR has been shown to have a significant effect on major DNA repair pathways, such as NER, BER and double-strand break repair.
0 Detection of active kallikrein in induced blister fluids of hereditary angioedema patients. Six suction-induced blister fluids obtained from five patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) contained active kallikrein, whereas only two blister fluids obtained from eight normal volunteers contained small amounts of this activity. Kallikrein was present in large amounts of HAE blister fluids as assessed by its ability to liberate smooth-muscle-contracting activity from purified high molecular weight kininogen. It was inhibited by purified antibodies specific for plasma prekallikrein and also by purified C1 inhibitor, but not by antibodies specific for C1s. These observations suggest that activation of the Hageman-factor-dependent pathways occurs in the tissues of HAE patients, and once generated, active kallikrein persists in these tissues.
3 Heterogeneity and specificity of cloned lines of influenza-virus specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Continuous lines of murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) directed to type A influenza viruses have been generated in vitro by stimulation of individual CTL precursors in the presence of T cell-growth factor TCGF and syngeneic virus-infected stimulator cells. The cloned CTL lines are H-2 restricted in their target cell recognition and exhibit distinct patterns of influenza virus recognition. All CTL lines appear to be restricted in target cell recognition to either the H-2K or the H-2D end of the appropriate H-2 haplotype. Likewise, CTL lines of F1 origin are restricted in recognition exclusively to one of the parental haplotypes. All CTL lines examined express the Thy-1.2 and the Lyt-2-surface antigen markers. 4 of 11 cytotoxic lines examined also expressed detectable levels of the Lyt-1- surface antigen. These findings confirm at the clonal level previous observations on the H-2K/D restriction of virus-specific CTL and also demonstrate heterogeneity among H-2 restricted CTL both from the standpoint of viral antigen recognition and cell surface phenotype.
1 Transplantation behavior of A.TH and A.TL T-cell lymphomas in congenic resistant and hybrid strains. Seven spontaneously arising T-cell lymphomas originating in A.TH or A.TL mice, which are congenic for the immune response gene (I) chromosomal segment were described. When transplanted into partner strains which were incompatible at the I region, the tumors were rapidly rejected. Rejection was proposed to be due to the presence of antigens controlled by I-region genes.
3 Human cytotoxic T-cell responses to type A and type B influenza viruses can be restricted by different HLA antigens. Implications for HLA polymorphism and genetic regulation. The present study compares human cytotoxic T-cell responses to two closely related viruses (type A and type B influenza) to understand the antigen-specific elements involved in HLA-linked genetic control of cytotoxic T-cell responses. The HLA antigens function as self antigens that are recognized by cytotoxic T cells sensitized against either virus. However, studies in an informative family indicate that in this family, the HLA antigens preferentially recognized in conjunction with type A influenza (A/HK) differ from the HLA antigens preferentially recognized in conjunction with type B influenza (B/HK). Similarly, population studies demonstrate that some (but not all) donors whose T cells recognized A/HK in conjunction with HLA-A2 failed to recognize B/HK in conjunction with HLA-A2. Thus, HLA-linked regulation must operate by a mechanism(s) that is specific both for the self HLA antigen and the viral antigen. Furthermore, these findings indicate that different HLA antigens may facilitate T-cell responses to different pathogens, which would result in an evolutionary advantage for HLA heterozygosity.
3 Inhibition of suppressor T lymphocytes by murine interferon beta. We have presented data showing that IFN-beta at 1,000 U/mouse i.v. inhibits the generation of Ts-mediated tolerance to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and abrogates the transfer of suppression by Ts. We have also presented data showing that IFN-beta up to 10,000 U/mouse i.v. has no adverse effect on sensitization and elicitation. IFN-beta appears to be a suitable agent for evaluation as an adjunct in the immunotherapy of Ts inducing tumors.
3 Haplotype-specific suppression of antibody responses in vitro. I. Generation of genetically restricted suppressor T cells by neonatal treatment with semiallogeneic spleen cells. C57BL/10 mice were injected with semiallogeneic (B10.D2 X C57BL/10)F(1) spleen cells via the anterior facial vein within 24 h of birth to induce tolerance to B10.D2 (H-2(d)) alloantigens. Spleen cells from these mice as adults developed reduced, but significant, mixed lymphocyte and cytotoxic lymphocyte responses in vitro to H-2(d) stimulator cells and these treated mice rejected first-set B10.D2 skin grafts within a normal time-course, indicating that at best only a state of partial tolerance had been induced. Spleen cells from these mice failed to develop antibody responses to a variety of antigens in vitro when H-2(d) macrophages were in the cultures. Partially purified T cells from these neonatally treated mice suppressed primary antibody responses by normal syngeneic spleen cells in the presence of H-2(d) but not other allogeneic macrophages. These radiosensitive, haplotype-specific suppressor T (Ts) cells inhibited primary antibody responses by blocking initiation of the response, but failed to suppress secondary antibody responses and mixed lymphocyte or cytotoxic lymphocyte responses by appropriate responding spleen cells. To activate H-2(d) haplotype-specific Ts cells, stimulation with IA(d) subregion antigen(s) was necessary and sufficient; syngenicity at the I-A subregion of H-2 between the activated Ts cells and target responding spleen cell populations was also necessary and sufficient to achieve suppression. Comparable results have been obtained with spleen cells from BALB/c mice injected as neonates with (B10.D2 x C57BL/10)F(1) spleen cells where IA(b) antigens activate the haplotype-specific Ts cells. Implications for the significance of this population of haplotype-specific Ts cells in immune regulation are discussed and the properties of these Ts cells are compared and contrasted with other antigen-specific and nonspecific Ts cells whose activity is restricted by I- region products.
2 Oral vaccination. Identification of classes of proteins that provoke an immune response upon oral feeding. Oral immunization of an animal is generally hard to achieve unless large quantities of antigen are administered. In this study a number of antigens were tested for their ability to elicit a systemic immune response upon oral administration. It was found that bacterial pili, LTB, lectins, and a viral hemagglutinin were all able to elicit significant antibody titers upon oral feeding. The immune response thus generated to LTB and K99 pili could be completely abolished by cofeeding a number of sugars that have close structural homology to the terminal sugars of the GM1 and GM2 gangliosides to which these molecules are known to bind. All of the proteins that were active in oral immunization are known to possess "lectin or lectin-like" binding activities. It is therefore proposed that these molecules are able to bind to glycolipids and glycoproteins on the intestinal mucosa and to stimulate these cells to transport the proteins into the systemic circulation, thereby eliciting a systemic immune response. Molecules that did not possess this binding activity were unable to elicit significant responses at the doses tested.
3 Phagosome-lysosome interactions in cultured macrophages infected with virulent tubercle bacilli. Reversal of the usual nonfusion pattern and observations on bacterial survival. Tubercle bacilli of the pathogenic human strain H37Rv had previously been shown to multiply, after ingestion by cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages, within phagosomes that tended to remain unfused with secondary lysosomes. Means were sought therefore for promoting experimentally a modification of the host response so as to attain a high level of phagolysosome formation, enabling tests to be made of any effects on the course and outcome of the intracellular infection. This was achieved by exposing viable bacilli to specific rabbit antiserum before their ingestion. Quantitative assessments, using electron microscopy, now showed that a majority of the phagosomes containing intact bacilli had fused with ferritin-labeled lysosomes, and frequently the fusion was massive. Bacterial viability studies established that the serum pretreatment was not itsel bactericidal. In the course of progressive infections with strain H37Rv, monitored by counts both of viable bacterial units and of intracellular acid-fast organisms, no appreciable difference was found between the intracellular growth rates of control and antiserum-treated bacilli. Concurrent electron microscopy showed that bacilli could remain intact and multiply both in phaagolysosomes and in unfused phagosomes, ruling out the possibility of selective growth of antiserum-pretreated bacilli within the minority of phagosomes that remained unfused. It was concluded that "turning on" phagosome-lysosome fusion in normal macrophages did not influence the outcome of infection with virulent M. tuberculosis; lysosome contents manifestly failed to exercise an antibacterial effect on this organism. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that the lysosomes of specific immune macrophages have antituberculous potentiality. In that case the experimental "turning on or off" of fusion could be a decisive factor in the outcome of a virulent challenge. Should it not be, the antibacterial capabilities of immune cells would need to be ascribed to factors other than lysosomal attack, the latter being essentially for disposal of the dead organisms.
0 Mouse macrophage hemagglutinin (sheep erythrocyte receptor) with specificity for sialylated glycoconjugates characterized by a monoclonal antibody. An inhibitory rat mAb, SER-4, has been raised to the mouse macrophage (M phi)-restricted hemagglutinin, sheep erythrocyte receptor (SER), which binds unopsonized sheep erythrocytes through recognition of sialylated glycoconjugates. This receptor was originally defined on mouse resident bone marrow M phi where it was implicated in adhesive interactions of these cells with proliferating hematopoietic cells. In the present study using mouse serum-induced thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal M phi (TPM) as a model system for SER expression, mAb SER-4 IgG2a completely blocked rosette formation at 1 microgram/ml. The inhibition was likely to be via steric hindrance rather than through a direct interaction with the putative sialic acid binding site of SER because F(ab')2 and Fab fragments of mAb SER-4 gave a maximum inhibition of 50-60% and 0% respectively, despite binding effectively to the SER-4 antigen (Ag). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments with cultured M phi or tissue extracts demonstrated that the Ag recognized by SER-4 mAb is a single chain molecule with an apparent Mr by SDS-PAGE of 185 x 10(3) (reduced) or 170 x 10(3) (non-reduced) and is distinct from members of the leukocyte common Ag family. Expression of SER and SER-4 Ag in culture were closely correlated and depended on the presence of mouse serum for optimal induction. Further evidence that the SER-4 Ag is functionally equivalent to SER was provided by immunocytochemistry in which the overall pattern of staining in tissues was consistent with previous rosetting experiments. In the bone marrow, expression of the SER-4 Ag was restricted to the resident bone marrow M phi population with no expression on monocytes. High expression was also observed on stromal M phi within the subcapsular sinus and medullary cords in lymph nodes and on marginal metallophils in the spleen. These results therefore confirm that SER is a novel M phi-restricted receptor whose distribution and properties indicate a role in cellular interactions in hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.
3 Regulation of T-cell-mediated lympholysis by the murine major histocompatibility complex. II. Control of cytotoxic responses to trinitrophenyl-K and -D self products by H-2K- and H-2D-Region genes. An H-2K/IA recombinant mouse strain was used to map the genes within the H-2 complex which determine the ability to respond in cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) to low doses of trinitrophenyl-self (TNP-self). It was found that gene(s) which map to the K region are involved in regulation of CML response to low-dose TNP-self. It was also found that CML response to TNP recognized in association with H-2Dq was not detectable in this recombinant. These findings are discussed with respect to the involvement of the H-2K and H-2D regions by structural and/or regulator gene functions.
3 The autoantigen Ku is indistinguishable from NF IV, a protein forming multimeric protein-DNA complexes. We have isolated a cDNA encoding the 84-kD subunit of NFIV. Tryptic peptide sequences were identified within the coding sequences, confirming its proper identity. The primary sequence of the protein is identical to that of the large subunit of the Ku autoantigen. A missing NFIV peptide sequence was identified within the sequence of the small subunit of Ku. In addition, the proteins are identical in immunological aspects. We suggest that the Ku and NFIV proteins are identical. This connection adds new biochemical data to our knowledge of the Ku autoantigen.
2 Transfer of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis to bone marrow chimeras. Endothelial cells are not a restricting element. The adoptive transfer of clinical and histopathologic signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) requires MHC compatibility between cell donor and cell recipient. The results of adoptive transfer studies using F1 to parent bone marrow chimeras as recipients of parental-derived BP-sensitive spleen cells indicate that this restriction is not expressed at the level of the endothelial cell but is confined to the cells of bone marrow derivation. Furthermore, these results indicate that the development of EAE is not dependent on the activity of MHC-restricted cytotoxic cells.
3 The reconstitution of cell-mediated immunity in the cutaneous lesions of lepromatous leprosy by recombinant interleukin 2. Human rIL-2 (10-30 micrograms) was injected intradermally into the skin of patients with lepromatous leprosy with high bacillary loads. All patients responded to the lymphokine with local areas of induration that peaked at 24 h and persisted for 4-7 d irrespective of whether the site was "normal skin" or a nodular lesion. Within 24 h there was an extensive emigration of T cells and monocytes into the site. The percentage of the dermis infiltrated by mononuclear cells increased by more than sevenfold, peaking at 4 d and persisting for greater than 15 d. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells entered the site. T cells of CD4+ phenotype predominated at 2-7 d but by 11 d, CD8+ cells were predominant. Considerable numbers of T6+ Langerhans' cells appeared in the dermis by 72 h and persisted for 3 wk. By 4 d the thickness of the overlying epidermis had increased twofold, and keratinocytes were expressing MHC class II antigen and the IFN-gamma-induced peptide IP-10. Starting at 48 h, there was an extensive destruction of mononuclear phagocytes that contained structurally intact or fragmented M. leprae observed at the electron microscope level. The organisms, either free or contained within endocytic vacuoles, were discharged into the extracellular space and then reingested by blood-borne monocytes. This was followed by marked reductions in the number of acid-fast organisms in the injected site, evident as early as 4-7 d and more marked at 2-3 wk after injection. 13 of 15 patients exhibited a disposal of acid-fast bacilli ranging from 5- to 1,000-fold with a mean value of approximately 100-fold. The administration of IL-2 leads to the generation of an effective cell-mediated immune response, recapitulating an antigen-driven event and leading to striking local reductions in M. leprae. In comparison with the purified protein derivative of tuberculin reaction, bacilli are cleared more promptly, although emigratory cells persist for a shorter time.
2 Mice with the xid defect have helper cells for T15 idiotype-dominant anti-phosphorylcholine primary and secondary plaque-forming cells responses. We have examined the abilities of helper T cells from commercially available (CBA/N X BALB/c)F1 (NBF1) xid male and phenotypically normal female mice to help T15+ and T15- B cells to produce thymus-dependent phosphorylcholine (PC)-specific direct plaque-forming cell responses. Carrier-primed T cells from both male and female mice were found (a) to restore T15+ TD responses in congenitally athymic BALB/c mice, (b) to help PC-primed BALB/c splenic B cells produce predominantly T15+ responses, and (c) to provide help for T15+ and T15- PFC responses generated by PC-primed normal F1 splenic B cells. Furthermore, carrier-primed irradiated xid and normal recipients contributed adequate helper activity for T15 dominant responses. We therefore conclude that male and female NBF1 mice are equally capable of helping T15+ responses.
3 Plasma membrane of Entamoeba histolytica. Axenically propagated Entamoeba histolytica (HK9:NIH strain) were employed as starting material for the isoation of plasma membrane by a novel procedure. In the absence of known enzymatic markers, the externally disposed polypeptides of intact amoebae were iodinated and the incorporated label used to monitor membrane separation and recovery. 12 major plasma membrane polypeptides (12 x 10(3)-200 x 10(3) mol wt) were labeled and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each of these was a glycoprotein. Preincubation of amoebae with concanavalin A stabilized the plasma membranes as large sheets, facilitating its separation by low-speed centrifugation. Dissociation of the lectin with alpha-methyl mannoside, followed by additional homogenization led to vesiculation and further purification. The isolated plasma membrane was recovered in high yield (28%) and enriched 30-fold in terms of incorporated iodide. All iodinated surface glycoproteins of the intact organism were present in the plasma membrane fraction. A Ca++-dependent ATPase was enriched in the plasma membrane to a similar extent, but over one-half of the total activity was associated with internal, unlabeled membranes, suggesting a dual localization of this activity. The isolated plasma membrane was enriched in cholesterol and had a cholesterol:molar ratio of 0.87. It also contained larger amounts of an unusual phospholipid--ceramide aminoethyl phosphonate--a phospholipase-resistant species.
3 Co-infection of macrophages modulates interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor-induced activation against intracellular pathogens. Co-infection of macrophages (M phi) with Toxoplasma gondii and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) has been observed in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In this study we have demonstrated that co-infected murine M phi respond differently to cytokine stimulation than M phi infected with either of the microorganisms alone. Whereas treatment with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) activated both single and co-infected groups of M phi to kill T. gondii, treatment with TNF did not influence the rate of MAC growth in co-infected M phi, in contrast with the inhibition of growth observed in MAC-infected M phi. These results suggest that in AIDS patients suffering infection with multiple intracellular pathogens, the ability of cytokines to stimulate microbicidal or static activity in mononuclear phagocytes can be impaired by the presence of more than one of the intracellular organisms.
3 Suppression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats after elimination of macrophages. Almost 50% of the cells infiltrating the central nervous system (CNS) of animals with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) are macrophages (M psi). To investigate the role of the M psi in the pathogenesis of EAE, we eliminated M psi by means of mannosylated liposomes containing dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Cl2MDP). Cl2MDP-containing liposomes injected intravenously eliminate M psi in spleen and liver. Incorporation of mannose into the lipid layers enables the liposomes to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Injections of Cl2MDP-containing mannose liposomes intravenously shortly before the appearance of clinical signs, markedly suppressed the expression of clinical signs of EAE. This suppression was accompanied by a marked reduction of infiltrated M psi in the CNS. Cl2MDP-containing liposomes without mannose incorporated had no effect. Cl2MDP-containing mannosylated liposomes had no effect on plasma corticosterone levels compared with injections of saline; thus, the suppression of expression of EAE was not corticosterone mediated. These results show that the M psi within the CNS play an important role in the pathogenesis of EAE.
3 Synthesis and processing of molecules bearing thymus leukemia antigen. Thymus-leukemia (TL) antigens are expressed in murine lymphocytes under strict developmental regulation. To elucidate the molecular basis of TL expression, we have identified the molecular species that react with TL antiserum. At least three species can be resolved by metabolic radiolabeling of thymocytes and ASL1 leukemia cells, lysis, immune precipitation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide. After a brief incubation with [35S]methionine, the only radioactive molecule recognized by TL antiserum is a homogeneous species with an apparent Mr of 45,000 daltons. This molecule, 45K TL, includes high-mannose-type carbohydrate attached to a 45,000 dalton glycosidase-resistant backbone. In this form, 45K, it is never exposed on the cell surface. If pulse-labeled cells are further incubated with nonradioactive methionine before lysis, however, radioactivity disappears from the 45K TL species and appears in the slower migrating species 46K and 48K TL. Thus, 46K and 48K appear to represent products generated from the 45K TL precursor by posttranslational modification. These TL forms are displayed on the cell surface; they lack high-mannose carbohydrate but evidently include acidic complex-type carbohydrate. Normal thymocytes from Qa:Tla-negative mice lack not only the surface forms of TL but also the intracellular 45K TL form. Peripheral lymphoid cells of Qa:Tla-positive mice synthesize none of these TL species. But the TL antiserum, which contains Qa antibody, recognizes a distinct gene product in spleen and thymus of Qa-Tla-positive mice. In its pulse-labeled form, this molecule, which may represent Qa-1, has an apparent Mr of 44,000 daltons, and consists of a glycosidase-resistant polypeptide core of only 35,000 daltons linked to more high mannose carbohydrate than 45K TL.
3 Concanavalin A-inducible, interleukin-2-producing T cell hybridoma. The fusion of an AKR T cell tumor line to normal B6D2F1, T cells resulted in the production of a cloned T cell hybridoma (FS6-14.13) inducible with the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A). The supernate from Con A-stimulated hybridoma cells was active both in the stimulation of an anti-sheep red blood cell response by partially T cell-depleted B cells and in the stimulation of the growth of antigen-specific T cell blasts. The active principle in both assays had a molecular weight of approximately 30-40,000. These results indicated the presence of interleukin 2 (IL2) in the hybridoma supernate. The activity of the hybridoma supernate in B cell responses was dependent on the presence of adherent cells and a few contaminating T cells. On the other hand, Con A-stimulated supernates from normal spleen cells were active after either adherent cell removal or severe T cell depletion. These results suggested that IL2 was the only active helper factor in the hybridoma supernate, but that additional helper factors were present in supernates from Con A-stimulated normal spleen cells.
3 Molecular relationship between private and public H-2 antigens as determined by antigen redistribution method. Molecular relationship of public H-2 antigens 1, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 25, and 28 to private antigens controlled by K and D regions was studied using the technique of antibody-induced resistance to complement-mediated cytotoxicity. The results indicate physical association in the cell membrane between H-2 antigens 1 and 23 of H-2-a, 8 and 31 of H-2-d, 11 and 17 of H-2-q, 13 and 30 of H-2-q, 25 and 23 of H-2-k, and 28 and 31 of H-2-g. These results are in agreement with genetic mapping placing the determinants of antigens H-2.8, 11 and 25 in the K region , the determinant of antigen H-2.13 in the D region, and the determinants of antigens H-2.1 and 28 in either the K or the D region. In contrast to genetic mapping placing the determinant for antigen H-2.6 in the D region, we found that in the H-2-b haplotype the antigen is associated with K region antigen H-2.33 and H-2.32, and interpreted this result as evidence for two homologous H-2.5 sites controlled by opposite ends of the H-2 complex. Although the data do not prove that public antigens are carried by the same molecules as private ones, they demonstrate a close physical association in the membrane between the two groups of loci, K and D, coding for the first 33 classical H-2 antigens (with the exception of antigen H-2.7), and thus support the two-locus model. The data also support the duplication model of H-2 by demonstrating two homologous H-2.5 sites associated with K and D molecules.
3 Mixed lymphocyte reactivity and cell-mediated lympholysis to trinitrophenyl-modified autologous lymphocytes in C57BL/10 congenic and B10-A recombinant mouse strains. Cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) to trinitrophenyl (TNP)-modified autologous splenic lymphocytes has been recently reported in the mouse (1). Both the sensitization and effector phases of this phenomenon were shown to be T-cell mediated. Effector cell specificity studies indicated that modification of the target cells is a necessary but insufficient requirement for cytolysis, and suggested that altered cell surface components controlled by genes mapping in the mouse major histocompatibility H-2 complex (MHC) are important in the specificity of the cytotoxic reaction (1). In allogeneic models the generation of cytotoxic effector cells has been shown to be preceded or accompanied by immunogen- induced proliferation of responding lymphocytes, i.e. a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) (2-5), although the generation of effectors may not necessarily always be the consequence of extensive cell proliferation (5). If the induction of cytotoxic effector lymphocytes by modified syngeneic spleen cells is characteristic of sensitization with cellular alloantigens, one would expect to find that sensitization with TNP-modified autologous cells would also induce thymidine incorporation by the responding cells in the culture. The present report demonstrates that both stimulation of thymidine incorporation and generation of cytotoxic effector cells are part of the in vitro response to TNP-modified autologous lymphocytes. However, the MLR to TNP- modified autologous cells consistently appeared to be less pronounced when compared with an allogeneic MLR, whereas the cytotoxic activity of the effector cells generated by sensitization against TNP-modified autologous cells was frequently as high as that detected against H-2 alloantigens. These two components of reactivity to "modified self" are verified in several C57BL/10 congenic and B10.A recombinant mouse strains.
3 Genetic markers of the antigen-specific T cell receptor locus. The restriction enzyme Eco RI reveals DNA cleavage sites that serve to distinguish the gene locus believed to encode the beta subunit of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted, antigen-specific receptor of the T cell in BALB/c mice from that of SJL/J mice. A monoclonal antibody, KJ16-133, also distinguishes BALB/c and SJL/J, because it recognizes an allotypic marker present on a cell-surface heterodimer believed to function as the MHC-restricted, antigen-specific T cell receptor. This study has shown that these two markers cosegregate in a set of BALB/c X SJL/J recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains, permitting the conclusion that they are linked to within 3 centimorgans of each other, and to the kappa locus on chromosome 6. The tight linkage between these independently derived, totally different T cell markers substantially strengthens the argument that they characterize the MHC-restricted antigen-specific receptor of the effector T cell.
3 A monoclonal antibody that detects a V kappa-TEPC15 idiotypic determinant cross-reactive with a Thy-1 determinant. To identify T lymphocyte antigens with immunoglobulin-like determinants, we prepared rat anti-mouse T cell monoclonal antibodies and screened them against a panel of purified mouse myeloma proteins representing all isotypes of immunoglobulin. One hybridoma, designated 42-21, was found to detect a novel antigenic determinant shared by V kappa-TEPC15 and the Thy-1 molecule on all T lymphocytes. Although several explanations for this unusual phenomenon exist, it may imply some role for the Thy-1 molecule in antigen and/or mitogen recognition. In any event, future studies of idiotypes on T lymphocytes must consider the possibility that anti-idiotypic sera detect cell surface molecules unrelated to classical immunoglobulin.
3 Histocompatibility antigens and genetic control of the immune response in guinea pigs. III. Specific inhibition of antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation by strain-specific anti-idiotypic antibodies. The in vitro T-cell proliferation induced by penicilloylated bovine IgG (BPO-BGG) in sensitized strain 2 and strain 13 guinea pigs could be specifically blocked by strain-specific antisera presumably directed against cell membrane-associated immunoglobulin idiotypes. The anti-idiotypic antisera were prepared in strain 2 and strain 13 guinea pigs against immunoadsorbent purified anti-BPO-BGG antibodies which had been raised in strain 2 and strain 13 animals. Strain 13 antistrain 13 anti-BPO-BGG (a strain 13 BPO-BGG) suppressed the in vitro BPO-BGG response of cells from immunized strain 13 animals but did not inhibit the response of cells from immune strain 2 animals. Conversely, the corresponding antiserum raised in a strain 2 combination (a strain 2 BPO-BGG) only inhibited the in vitro BPO-BGG response of strain 2 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of the antisera could only be absorbed by immune cells from the syngeneic strain. The activity of the a strain 13 BPO-BGG serum was highly specific; the inhibitory activity could only be absorbed by BPO-BGG-sensitive strain 13 cells. The inhibitory activity of the anti-idiotypic sera was predominantly associated with the 19S fraction. The data suggest that immune cells and in particular T lymphocytes from strain 2 and strain 13 guinea pigs possess strain-specific recognition structures from BPO-BGG with the same idiotypes as the corresponding strain-specific immunoglobulins. Furthermore, the production of such inhibitory anti-idiotypic sera was restricted to syngeneic combinations, which suggests a potential role of autoanti-idiotypic antibodies in the regulation of the immune response. The anti-idiotypic antisera used here are apparently directed against gene products not associated with the strain 2 or strain 13 major histocompatibility complex.
3 T cell hybrids that express a VH idiotope-related determinant on a glycoprotein distinct from H-2, Thy-1, and Lyt-1 molecules. Two mouse monoclonal antibodies to chicken immunoglobulin VH-associated idiotypes (Id), CId-1 and CId-2, were used as probes for Id determinants on mouse T cells. CId-1, which recognized chicken antibodies to N-acetyl glucosamine (NAGA), and approximately 0.4% of chicken T lymphocytes also reacted with approximately 0.2% of BALB/c splenic Thy-1.2+ cells. When enriched CId-1+ splenic T cells from NAGA-immune BALB/c mice were fused with the AKR thymoma BW 5147 cell line, 2 of 72 resulting hybrids, termed CId-1A and CId-1B, were reactive by indirect immunofluorescence with the CId-1 antibody. CId-1 determinants were expressed both in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that both CId-1+ T cell hybrids were phenotypically identical: CId-2-/Ig-/Lyt-1+2-/Thy-1.2+/II-2d+/I-Ad-/I-Ak-/I-Jd+/I-Jk+. Incubation of CId-1B hybrid cells with concanavalin A or lentil lectin resulted in capping of the CId-1 determinant, whereas incubation with pokeweed mitogen, lipopolysaccharide, phytohemagglutinin, and wheat germ agglutinin had no effect on the cell surface distribution of the CId-1 molecule. Trypsin or pronase treatment resulted in the loss of detectable CId-1 determinant on the cell surface. Treatment of CId-1B cells with tunicamycin also reduced the immunofluorescence intensity of the surface CId-1 determinant, but had no effect on its cytoplasmic expression. CId-1 antibody-induced capping of the CId-1 marker did not affect the surface distribution of Lyt-1, Thy-1.2, H-2d, I-Jd, or I-Jk molecules. Conversely, capping of I-Jd and I-Jk determinants did not alter the surface distribution of CId-1. These results suggest that the CId-1 determinant is on a glycoprotein that is not physically linked to the Lyt-1, Thy-1.2, H-2d, I-Jd, and I-Jk molecules. The clonal restriction of CId-1 expression by T cells suggests that the CId-1+ molecule could be a T cell antigen receptor.
1 Direct observation of the gene organization of the complement C4 and 21-hydroxylase loci by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis and enzymes that cut genomic DNA infrequently have been used to define large RFLPs at the human C4 loci. With the enzymes BssH II or Sac II, and C4 or 21-hydroxylase DNA probes, it has been possible to observe directly the number of C4 genes present on a haplotype, and also whether the C4 genes are long (6-7-kb intron present) or short (6-7-kb intron absent). Haplotypes that have either two long C4 genes or one long and one short C4 gene generate BssH II fragments of approximately 115 or approximately 105 kb, respectively. Haplotypes that have either a single long or a single short C4 gene generate BssH II fragments of approximately 80 or approximately 70 kb, respectively. This technique has been used to analyze the DNA isolated from PBMC and allows the complete definition of the C4 gene organization of an individual without the need for family studies.
3 Biological and biochemical characterization of a cloned Leu-3- cell surviving infection with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome retrovirus. Leu-3- cells that survive infection with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) retrovirus can be induced with IUdR to express infectious virus. A cellular clone (8E5), isolated by limiting dilution of a mass culture of survivor cells, was found to contain a single, integrated provirus that was constitutively expressed. Although IUdR treatment of 8E5 cells failed to induce infectious virus, cocultivation with Leu-3+ cells generated the characteristic syncytia associated with acute AIDS retrovirus infection. The single integrated copy of proviral DNA directs the synthesis of all major viral structural proteins except p64, as monitored by immunoblotting. The relationship of the 8E5 clone to viral latency and persistence is discussed.
3 Regulation of the antibody response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide by contrasuppressor T cells. A soluble membrane component of type III pneumococcal polysaccharide-coupled spleen cells (S3-SCSM) induces S3-specific suppressor T cells (Ts) in mice. These Ts can be detected only if mice are pretreated with cyclophosphamide (Cy) or if cells adherent to the lectin Vicia villosa are removed from the spleen cell population prior to transfer. The V. villosa-adherent spleen cells from mice injected with S3-SCSM could abrogate suppression mediated by Ts induced by S3-SCSM in Cy-treated mice. The V. villosa-adherent contrasuppressor cells were shown to be T cells that were I-J+ and of the Lyt-1 phenotype. Contrasuppressor T cells (Tcs) were not present in V. villosa-adherent spleen cell fractions obtained from normal mice, from mice injected with polyvinylpyrrolidone-coupled spleen cells, or from Cy-treated mice injected with S3-SCSM, i.e., mice in which Ts activity is dominant. The V. villosa-adherent cells that abrogated the activity of Ts induced by S3-SCSM in Cy-treated mice did not abrogate suppression mediated by a different subset of S3-specific Ts, suggesting that the Tcs described here do not have activity against all Ts subsets. The ability of S3-SCSM to activate Tcs in normal mice provides an explanation for the inability to detect S3-specific Ts in several previous studies.
3 Serum amyloid P component binds to cell nuclei in vitro and to in vivo deposits of extracellular chromatin in systemic lupus erythematosus. Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is the single plasma protein that, from the milieu of whole normal human serum, undergoes specific calcium-dependent binding to isolated DNA and chromatin in vitro. We now report for the first time that SAP in whole serum also undergoes calcium-dependent binding to nuclei of epidermal cells in sections of normal human skin and to nuclei of fixed Hep-2 cells, a human epithelial cell line. Furthermore, and most importantly, SAP was detected in association with unusual globular dermal deposits of nuclear material in skin biopsies from two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. This is the first evidence for binding of SAP to extracellular chromatin in vivo and supports the idea that SAP may have an important physiological role in the disposal of this material.
2 Specific suppression of allograft rejection by trinitrophenyl (TNP)-induced suppressor cells in recipients treated with TNP-haptenated donor alloantigens. Suppressor T cells, activated by injection of trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid in DA rats, prevented rejection of LEW kidney allografts in a donor-specific manner when adoptively transferred into syngeneic recipients along with trinitrophenyl (TNP)-haptenated LEW alloantigen. TNP-haptenated third-party alloantigen was ineffective in this system. The donor-specific suppression was dependent, too, on the haptenic portion of the chemically modified alloantigen. Hence, fluorescein isothiocyanate-donor antigen did not lead to suppression in the presence of TNP-reactive suppressor cells. There is, however, some crossreaction between DNP- and TNP-haptenated alloantigens so that TNP-reactive cells and DNP-donor antigen suppressed rejection whereas DNP-reactive cells and TNP-donor antigen did not prevent graft rejection. The suppressor cells were sensitive to cyclophosphamide and radiation but were resistant to hydrocortisone. They appear to be T cells of the OX8 (suppressor/cytotoxic) phenotype since they are positive for the pan T cell antigen W3/13, are Ig negative, and do not carry the W3/25 (T helper cell) marker. However, these suppressor cells are adherent to nylon wool. They are found mainly in the spleen, are detected there within 2 d of TNBS injection, and can persist for up to 12 wk. We propose that these cells are first-order T suppressor (Ts1) cells that act in the afferent phase of the response to a renal allograft.
1 Soluble cytokine receptors are present in normal human urine. Affinity chromatography of crude human urinary proteins on either human rIL-6, human rIFN-gamma, or anti-IFN-gamma-R mAb yielded the two respective soluble receptors in significant quantities. A single sequence of 30 amino acid residues was obtained by NH2-terminal microsequencing of the protein peak purified in tandem by affinity chromatography on an IL-6 column and reversed-phase HPLC. This sequence was identical to the predicted NH2-terminal sequence of IL-6-R as previously reported. Analysis of the eluted proteins from both IFN-gamma and anti-IFN-gamma-R columns by inhibition of solid phase RIA, ELISA, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting proved the existence of soluble IFN-gamma-R in normal urine. Our finding, together with the already known presence of urinary TNF binding proteins and a soluble IL-2-R both in plasma and in urine, indicates that release of soluble cytokine receptors into body fluids is a general phenomenon that occurs under normal physiological conditions.
3 T cell receptor and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in acute myeloblastic leukemia. The organization and expression of the beta chain of T cell antigen receptor gene (beta-TCR) and Ig H and L chain genes were analyzed by Southern blot technique in 24 patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Rearrangements of the beta-TCR genes were seen in DNA samples from 3 of the 24 patients. One of these three patients also showed rearrangement of the Ig H chain gene. RNA samples from all three patients expressed a beta-TCR gene transcript on dot blot analysis. However, on Northern blot analysis, one patient expressed an incomplete 1.0 kb transcript and no Ig H chain mRNA, despite a rearranged configuration. The karyotypes of two of these patients showed abnormalities involving chromosome 7. Rearrangements of T cell antigen receptor genes may occur in nonlymphoid malignancy, and is consistent with the concept of lineage infidelity in AML.
1 Immunocytochemical localization of the Heymann nephritis antigen (GP330) in glomerular epithelial cells of normal Lewis rats. The nephritogenic antigen of Heymann's nephritis (HN) was previously purified from tubular brush-border fractions of rat kidney and found to be a 330,000- mol-wt glycoprotein (gp330). This study was conducted to determine whether gp330 is also present in the rat glomerulus, and, if so, to establish where in the glomerulus it is located. Rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies were raised against purified gp330, which specifically immunoprecipitated gp330 from solubilized brush-border fractions and specifically stained microvilli and coated invaginations (located at the base of the microvilli) of proximal tubule cells. Accordingly, they were used to localize gp330 by immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry in glomeruli of normal Lewis rats. For immunoprecipitation, purified glomerular fractions were prepared from [(35)S]-methionine-labeled kidneys, extracted with Triton X-100, and the extract was used for immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal, or mouse monoclonal, anti-gp330 IgG. Analysis of immunoprecipitates by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fluorography indicated that a band corresponding in mobility to gp330 was specifically precipitated. When unfixed cryostat sections were incubated for indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal or affinity-purified polyclonal IgG, a fine granular fluorescent staining was seen throughout the glomerulus. When aldehyde-fixed cryostat sections were incubated for indirect immunoperoxidase, reaction product was detected only in the epithelial cells and was not seen in the GBM, endothelium, or mesangium. Within the epithelium it was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, occasional Golgi elements, multivesicular bodies, and coated pits at the cell surface. The reactive coated pits were distributed all along the cell membrane, including the sides and base of the foot processes. Reaction product was detected in the latter location only in sections that had been digested with neuraminidase before antibody incubation. When rats were given rabbit anti-gp330 IgG by intravenous injection and their kidneys stained for direct immunoperoxidase 3 d later, rabbit IgG was seen to be deposited beneath the slit diaphragms and in the coated pits at the base of the foot processes. The immunocytochemical and immunoprecipitation data indicate, in confirmation of the results of others, that the nephritogenic HN antigen is present in renal glomeruli as well as in proximal tubular brush borders. The immunocytochemical results further demonstrate that gp330 is an epithelial, rather than a glomerular basement membrane, antigen. It appears to be synthesized by glomerular epithelial cells and subsequently becomes concentrated in coated pits. As both the endogenous antigen (gp330) and exogenously administered anti-gp330 antibody were localized to coated pits, it seems likely that coated pits located at the base of the foot processes are the sites where the HN antigen (gp330) and circulating antibodies directed against gp330 meet and where immune complexes are formed.
3 Structural, functional, and idiotypic characteristics of a phosphorylcholine-binding IgA myeloma protein of C57BL/ka allotype. An IgA phosphorylcholine (PC)-binding myeloma protein with IgCH allotypic determinants different from those of BALB/c mice is characterized. The myeloma, CBPC 2, was induced in the CB-20 strain of mice which is congenic to BALB/c but differs from it by carrying the A15 allotypic determinant of C57BL/ka mice. Sequence analysis of the CBPC 2 light chain through the first hypervariable region, as well as isoelectric point analysis, show that this chain is indistinguishable from that of T15, a PC-binding myeloma protein of BALB/c origin. The heavy chains of CBPC 2 and T15 differ by only two amino acids (positions 14 and 16) through the first hypervariable region. As measured by inhibition of precipitation, both CBPC 2 and T15 have the same specificity for PC, glycerophosphorylcholine, acetylcholine, and choline. In addition, CBPC 2 possesses the binding site-associated idiotypic determinant which is present on T15. However, like normal or induced C57BL/6 anti-PC antibody, it does not possess the nonbinding site idiotypic determinant.
3 Selective anergy of V beta 8+,CD4+ T cells in Staphylococcus enterotoxin B-primed mice. The cellular basis of the in vitro and in vivo T cell responses to Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) has been investigated. The proliferation and cytotoxicity of V beta 8.1,2+,CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed in in vitro response to SEB. In primary cytotoxicity assays, CD4+ T cells from control spleens were more active than their CD8+ counterparts, however, in cells derived from SEB-primed mice, CD8+ T cells were dominant in SEB-specific cytotoxicity. In vivo priming with SEB abrogated the response of V beta 8.1,2+,CD4+ T cells despite the fact that these cells exist in significant number. This SEB-specific anergy occurred only in V beta 8.1,2+,CD4+ T cells but not in CD8+ T cells. These findings indicate that the requirement for the induction of antigen-specific anergy is different between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in post-thymic tolerance, and the existence of coanergic signals for the induction of T cell anergy is suggested.
2 Lysosomal elastase and cathepsin G in beige mice. Neutrophils of beige (Chediak-Higashi) mice selectively lack lysosomal elastase and cathepsin G. A profound decrease in activities of the two lysosomal serine proteinases, elastase, and cathepsin G, was found in neutrophils of four independent beige mutants. Elastase and cathepsin G activities were assayed with the specific synthetic substrates MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-MCA and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, respectively. The defect is intrinsic to cells of beige mice, since transplantation of bone marrow from normal to mutant mice restored normal proteinase activity, and normal mice transplanted with beige marrow produced neutrophils with a deficiency of proteinase activity. The loss of elastase and cathepsin G activity was confirmed by separation of [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate-labeled proteins on denaturing gels, which also revealed that other serine proteinases are at normal levels in beige neutrophil extracts. The deficiency of lysosomal proteinase activity appears specific, in that four other common neutrophil lysosomal enzymes, plus the spectrum of major neutrophil proteins are not affected by the beige mutation. The deficiency of proteinase activity is likely not the primary genetic alteration of the beige mutation, since more than one proteinase is affected, and heterozygous F1 mice have normal rather than intermediate levels of both proteinases. The lowered proteinase activity may contribute to the high susceptibility of beige mice and Chediak-Higashi patients to infection.
3 Different classes of T lymphocytes have different mRNAs for the leukocyte-common antigen, T200. The leukocyte common antigen, T200, is expressed on all white blood cells but not on other differentiated cells. Within the hematopoietic lineage, specific cell types display characteristic structural forms of the molecule on their surface. We show that murine cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones and helper T cell clones contain different size mRNA for this molecule, and that the early precursors of T200 glycoprotein made in the helper and cytotoxic T cells differ in Mr. Thus, in addition to differences in posttranslational modifications, it is highly likely that a difference in protein structure contributes to the distinct forms of T200 glycoprotein found on these functional T cell subsets.
0 Matching of calcineurin activity to upstream effectors is critical for skeletal muscle fiber growth. Calcineurin-dependent pathways have been implicated in the hypertrophic response of skeletal muscle to functional overload (OV) (Dunn, S.E., J.L. Burns, and R.N. Michel. 1999. J. Biol. Chem. 274:21908-21912). Here we show that skeletal muscles overexpressing an activated form of calcineurin (CnA*) exhibit a phenotype indistinguishable from wild-type counterparts under normal weightbearing conditions and respond to OV with a similar doubling in cell size and slow fiber number. These adaptations occurred despite the fact that CnA* muscles displayed threefold higher calcineurin activity and enhanced dephosphorylation of the calcineurin targets NFATc1, MEF2A, and MEF2D. Moreover, when calcineurin signaling is compromised with cyclosporin A, muscles from OV wild-type mice display a lower molecular weight form of CnA, originally detected in failing hearts, whereas CnA* muscles are spared this manifestation. We also show that OV-induced growth and type transformations are prevented in muscle fibers of transgenic mice overexpressing a peptide that inhibits calmodulin from signaling to target enzymes. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that both calcineurin and its activity-linked upstream signaling elements are crucial for muscle adaptations to OV and that, unless significantly compromised, endogenous levels of this enzyme can accommodate large fluctuations in upstream calcium-dependent signaling events.
3 Termination of aquired and natural immunological tolerance with specific complexes. It was possible to terminate the induced unresponsive state to bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the natural unresponsive state to autologous thyroglobulin in rabbits (RTg) by immunization with complexes composed of heterologous cross-reacting antibody and the tolerated antigens. The unresponsive state was terminated in rabbits made unresponsive by neonatal injections of BSA and then 3 mo later injected with complexes composed of BSA and guinea pig antihuman serum albumin. This termination was manifested by the presence of anti-BSA plaque-forming cells. Similarly, the natural unresponsive state was terminated in adult rabbits injected with complexes between RTg and guinea pig antibovine thyroglobulin (BTg) in that thyroid lesions and circulating anti-RTg were produced. The results can be best explained by the presence of unresponsive T cells and competent B cells, where the guinea pig gamma globulin (antibody) activates T cells specific for the guinea pig gamma globulin portion of the complexes and thus permits stimulation of B cells competent to the exposed determinants of the tolerated (BSA or RTg) portion of the complexes. The detailed mechanism for the activation of B cells in tolerant animals is discussed.
0 Correlation of early murine leukemia virus titer and H-2 type with spontaneous leukemia in mice of the BALB/c times AKR cross: a genetic analysis. Tissue extracts from 6-wk old mice of the AKR strain (H-K) show high levels of infectious murine leukemia virus, and these mice show a near 100% incidence of spontaneous leukemia. In F1 mice of the cross, BALB/c times AKR (H-2K/H-2K), both the occurrence of virus and the incidence of spontaneous leukemia are suppressed to very low values, due largely to the presence of the FV-1b allele inherited from the BALB/c parent. Mice of the (BALB/c times AKR) F-1 times AKR backcross generation were observed for possible correlations between virus expressions at 6 wk of age, H-2 type and leukemia incidence. H-2 type showed at most a weak influence on the occurrence of infectious virus, but there was a very strong correlation between the level of virus expression and the occurrence of leukemia and a strong correlation between H-2 type and leukemia. In addition, there was a highly significant nonrandom distribution of virus-negative mice among the backcross litters, suggesting a maternal effect on virus expression.
1 Purification and characterization of eight class 5 outer membrane protein variants from a clone of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A. Methods published for the purification of P.II proteins from Neisseria gonorrhoea have been modified to allow the purification of class 5 proteins from Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A bacteria. The five class 5 protein electrophoretic variants detected within an epidemic in the Gambia (a, b, c, d, and e) and three other variants (f, g, and h) found within other isolates of the same clone in West Africa have been purified with yields of 6-28 mg. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence for variant c differs from those of the other class 5 proteins, whereas the latter are very similar to the sequence predicted for two class 5 proteins from DNA analyses of serogroup C meningococci and determined for 8 P.II proteins from gonococci. Numerous other regulatory, chemical, and serological differences were found between the c protein and the other class 5 proteins such that we recommend that the class 5 proteins be subdivided into two subclasses. mAbs have been isolated that distinguish between these two protein subclasses and Western blotting with these antibodies enabled us to conclude that both protein subclasses were found in bacteria isolated from different epidemics and pandemics of the last 50 yr.
3 Recognition of polymorphic H-2 domains by T lymphocytes. I. Functional role of different H-2 domains for the generation of alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes and determination of precursor frequencies. In the present communication, the repertoire of alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) clones was quantitatively investigated by limiting dilution analysis and by target inhibition with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). These mAb have previously been shown to define two distinct alloantigenic domains, A and B, on the H-2Kk molecule. The Poisson distribution analysis of H-2Kk-specific CTL clones generated in a limiting dilution system revealed three CTL populations with different precursor frequencies. The high frequent population is suppressed by an unknown suppressive mechanism that allows less frequent CTL populations to become visible. Target inhibition studies with a panel of Kk-specific mAb showed that these CTL populations differ not only in their precursor frequency but also in their specificity for different H-2 epitopes on the Kk molecule. Thus clones of the high frequency population are almost exclusively specific for determinants within domain A. In contrast, the low frequency population displays predominant specificity for determinants of domain B, while the population with medium frequency is blocked equally well by mAb against either domains A or B. Each mAb blocked only a fraction of clones indicating that each CTL subpopulation may consist of a large number of clonotypes with specificity for different H-2 epitopes. The data suggest that CTL recognize basically the same polymorphic domains on the H-2Kk molecule defined by antibodies, and they show that regulatory mechanisms determine the expressed repertoire in CTL populations.
1 Antibacterial activity of human natural killer cells. The in vitro effects of human NK cells on viability of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was investigated. PBLs depleted of glass-adherent cells showed a significant antibacterial activity that was increased as the concentration of NK cells became higher. Leu-11-enriched cells exhibited the most efficient bactericidal activity. Stimulation of NK cells with staphylococcal enterotoxin B for 16 h produced a significant increase in the antibacterial activity of all NK cells tested. The antibacterial activity of monocyte-depleted cells and Leu-11-enriched cells was also enhanced after culturing in vitro for 16-24 h without exogenous cytokines. Dependence of the antibacterial activity on the presence of serum in the culture medium was not found. Ultrastructural studies revealed close contact between NK cell membranes and bacteria, no evidence of phagocytosis, and extracellular bacterial ghosts, after incubation at 37 degrees C. Supernatants from purified NK cells exhibited potent bactericidal activity with kinetics and target specificity similar to that of effector cells. These results document the potent antibacterial activity of purified NK cells and suggest an extracellular mechanism of killing.
0 Type II collagen-induced arthritis in mice. I. Major histocompatibility complex (I region) linkage and antibody correlates. A model of arthritis was established by the injection of type II collagen into mice. Only mice bearing the H-2q haplotype were susceptible to the disease. Susceptibility was further mapped by the use of recombinant strains on the Iq locus. Type II collagen arthritis was observed in the (resistant X susceptible) F1 cross. Mice strains were designated high, intermediate, or low responders with respect to the anti-type II antibody levels measured by radioimmunoassay. Arthritis-susceptible strains were all classified as high antibody responders. The clinical and histological appearance of type II collagen arthritis in the mouse indicates that it may be a good animal model for the investigation of various immunogenetic traits in rheumatoid arthritis.
3 X-linked B-lymphocyte immune defect in CBA/N mice. II. Studies of the mechanisms underlying the immune defect. The mechanisms underlying the X-linked thymus-independent (B) lymphocyte functional defect in the CBA/N (CN) mice and their F1 progeny were studied. Immune defective mice were unable to respond to the T-independent antigen 2,4-dinitrophenyl-lysyl-derivative of Ficoll (DNP-lys-Ficoll) but were able to form antibody against the highly cross-reactive hapten (trinitrophenyl) when it was coupled to an erythrocyte carrier. Immune defective CN X DBA/2N (DN) F1 male mice, which do not normally respond to T-independent antigens, were able to respond to both polyribosinic-polyribocytidylic acid and DNP-lys-Ficoll after the administration of CN X DN F1 female spleen cells even if these cells had been depleted of T lymphocytes. In addition, it was shown that the inability of the CN mice and their F1 progeny to respond to T-independent antigens was not due to an intrinsic abnormality of their microenvironment or the suppressive actions of a T lymphocyte. Our data present evidence that the X-linked defect in the CN mice is due to an intrinsic defect in B-lymphocyte development.
0 Tumorigenicity and lysis by natural killers. Detailed analysis of the natural killer (NK) activity directed at nontumorigenic cell lines and their transformed tumorigenic derivatives has revealed a paradox. On the one hand, a correlation has been found between the tumorigenic potential of chemically transformed fibroblast cell lines and their sensitivity to NK cells in vitro. Nontransformed cells (N-type cell lines) and cells tumorigenic in normal mice (C-type cell lines) are resistant to NK-mediated lysis. In contrast, cell lines that are tumorigenic in ATxFL mice (these mice are very low in NK activity), but not in normal mice (I-type cell lines) are sensitive to NK-mediated lysis. These findings support the concept that NK activity is involved in host surveillance against tumors. On the other hand, NK-resistant fibroblasts, whether taken directly form animals or derived as tumorigenic or nontumorigenic cell lines, compete with NK-sensitive target cells to inhibit their lysis by NK effectors. Not only are both NK-sensitive and -resistant cells recognized by NK effectors but both receive lytic signals from NK effector cells. Target cell resistance is a result of a protein synthesis-dependent mechanism that prevents lysis such that in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis all fibroblasts tested are NK sensitive. Those fibroblasts that are normally sensitive to NK-mediated lysis must be deficient in their ability to produce or respond to this counterlytic mechanism. These findings are in contrast with the general findings when lymphoid cells are studied as NK targets where sensitivity appears to be a result of recognition by NK effectors. Because our findings show that transformed and normal cells express the same recognition determinants, in order for NK activity to play an important in vivo role in tumor surveillance, a mechanism must operate to permit NK effectors to find their targets in vivo. In the absence of a special discrimination mechanism, the killing of NK-sensitive transformants that arise autochronously would be less than optimal as a consequence of competition by the normal, NK-resistant, cells.
2 Central pyrogenic activity of muramyl dipeptide. Fever can be elicited in the rabbit by the intravenous administration of relatively large doses of a synthetic immunoadjuvant, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, or muramyl dipeptide (MDP). This response could be mediated by endogenous pyrogen because MDP has been shown to induce their production both in vivo and in vitro. The results reported here show that intracisternal injection of minute amounts of MDP could elevate fever without activating the release of endogenous pyrogen in the plasma or in the cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, indomethacin inhibited hyperthermia produced by intracerebroventricular administration of MDP. Therefore, our findings argue in favor of a direct effect of the glycopeptide on the thermoregulatory centers besides its indirect effect through the production of leukocytic pyrogen. This molecule apparently represents the minimal requirement for the pyrogenicity of bacterial peptidoglycan because administration, even by the intracerebral route, of a mixture of muramic acid and of its dipeptide moiety did not elicit fever.
0 Cutaneous lymphoproliferation and lymphomas in interleukin 7 transgenic mice. To investigate the role of interleukin 7 (IL-7) in the development of the lymphoid system, we have generated two lines of transgenic mice carrying an IL-7 cDNA fused to an immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter and enhancer. This transgene is expressed in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and skin provoking a perturbation of T cell development characterized by a marked reduction of CD4+ CD8+ (double-positive) thymocytes. Quite unexpectedly, however, both lines also develop a progressive cutaneous disorder involving a dermal lymphoid infiltrate that results in progressive alopecia, hyperkeratosis, and exfoliation. Although the infiltrate is primarily composed of T lineage cells, its development is not impeded in the athymic nu/nu background. Furthermore, the phenotype can be transmitted horizontally by transplanting lymphoid tissues or skin to syngeneic wild-type mice. Thus, the phenotype is conveyed by skin-homing, mobile cells (presumably the infiltrating lymphocytes) in a cell-autonomous fashion. In addition to the skin phenotype, this transgene also provokes the development of a lymphoproliferative disorder that induces B and T cell lymphomas within the first 4 mo of life. These findings suggest potential physiologic actions of IL-7 in T cell development and in cutaneous immunity. They also demonstrate that IL-7 can act as an oncogene in the living organism.
3 Lentivirus-mediated antagomir expression for specific inhibition of miRNA function. Micro RNAs (miRNA) regulate gene expression by hybridization and recruitment of multi-protein complexes to complementary mRNA target sequences. miRNA function can transiently be antagonized by antagomirs-chemically modified oligonucleotides complementary to individual miRNAs. Here, we describe the induction of stable loss-of-function phenotypes for specific miRNAs by lentivirus-mediated antagomir expression. Lentivirally expressed antagomirs are transcribed from a H1-promoter located within the lentiviral 3'LTR and were directed against miRNAs encoded on the polycistronic miR17-92 transcript. Functional silencing of miR-18a, miR-19b and miR-20a by the corresponding antagomirs specifically relieves miRNA-mediated reporter gene repression. Inhibition of miRNA function correlates to reduction of 'miRNA' amplification by miRNA-specific quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, protein expression of E2F-1, a known miR-20 target, is enhanced by lentivirally expressed anti-miR-20 antagomirs in a dose-dependent manner, whereas over-expression of miR-20a reduces E2F-1 levels. Finally, combined over-expression of specific miRNAs and antagomirs reveals individual and complementary functions of miR-18a and miR-20a and demonstrates specific miRNA impact on cell proliferation in a cell culture model.
3 Distribution of decay-accelerating factor in the peripheral blood of normal individuals and patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is a 70,000 Mr protein that has been isolated from the membrane of red cells. The function of DAF is to inhibit the assembly of amplifying enzymes of the complement cascade on the cell surface, thereby protecting them from damage by autologous complement. We raised monoclonal antibodies to DAF and used them to study its distribution in cells from the peripheral blood of normal individuals and of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a disease characterized by the unusual susceptibility of red cells to the hemolytic activity of complement. The results of immunoradiometric assays and of fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that DAF was present not only on red cells but was widely distributed on the surface membrane of platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, and B and T lymphocytes. By Western blotting, we observed small but consistent differences in the Mr of DAF from the membranes of various cell types. Quantitative studies showed that phagocytes and B lymphocytes, which presumably enter more frequently in contact with immune complexes and other potential activators of complement, had the highest DAF levels. As previously reported by others, the red cells from PNH patients were DAF deficient. When the patients' red cells were incubated in acidified serum (Ham test), only the DAF-deficient cells were lysed. In addition, we detected defects in DAF expression on platelets and all types of leukocytes. The observed patterns of DAF deficiency in these patients were consistent with the concept that the PNH cells were of monoclonal origin. In one patient, abnormal and normal cells were found only in the erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic lineages. In two other patients, the lymphocytes were also DAF deficient, suggesting that a mutation occurred in a totipotent stem cell. It appears, therefore, that the lesion leading to PNH can occur at various stages in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells.
2 T cells that help B cell responses to soluble antigen are distinguishable from those producing interleukin 2 on mitogenic or allogeneic stimulation. An mAb MRC OX-22, reactive with the high molecular weight forms of the rat leukocyte-common antigen, has revealed a heterogeneity among CD4+ T cells in this species. Approximately two-thirds are CD4+, OX-22+, and one-third are CD4+, OX-22-. This phenotypic heterogeneity was found to be associated with a functional one. CD4+, OX-22+ cells proliferated well in mixed leukocyte culture, responded to the T cell mitogen Con A, and produced IL-2 on activation. In contrast, the CD4+, OX-22- cells performed poorly in these assays, but unlike CD4+, OX-22+ cells, did provide effective help for B cells. By sampling supernatants from cultures containing primed B cells and either of the two CD4+ T cell subsets, it was shown that, when specific antigen was included in the cultures, those containing the OX-22- subset of CD4+ cells produced high levels of antibody and some IL-2, whereas those containing the OX-22+ cells produced neither. In contrast, when specific antigen was replaced by Con A, the B cell cultures supplemented with CD4+, OX-22+ cells synthesized much higher levels of IL-2 than those containing CD4+, OX-22- cells, but only the latter cultures produced detectable levels of antibody. The data show that inducer/helper T cells comprise two functional subsets: one that, on appropriate stimulation, synthesizes high levels of IL-2, and may therefore be presumed to play an important role in cell-mediated immunity, and another that plays an essential role in humoral responses to soluble antigens. The significance of this functional heterogeneity, with regard to the possible independent regulation of cellular and humoral responses, is briefly considered.
0 A unique sequence of the NZW I-E beta chain and its possible contribution to autoimmunity in the (NZB x NZW)F1 mouse. The (NZB x NZW)F1 mouse strain develops a syndrome of accelerated autoimmunity including severe renal disease and early death. Evidence suggests that class II molecules play a central role in this process. Previous studies have suggested that the NZW strain contributes at least one gene to the development of accelerated autoimmunity that is linked to the H-2 complex, and antibodies to murine class II molecules have been used to ameliorate disease in (NZB x NZW)F1 mice. We therefore wished to sequence the class II molecules from NZW mice to identify any unique sequences that may contribute to disease development. We constructed oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5' and 3' regions of the second exon of class II genes from a variety of haplotypes, and used these primers in a polymerase chain reaction to sequence the second exon of the NZW I-A alpha, I-A beta, and I-E beta genes. We report that the second exons of NZW I-A alpha, I-A beta, and I-E alpha are identical to their counterparts of the previously sequenced u haplotype, and that the second exon of NZW I-E beta is identical to its counterpart from u except for a single base change that results in a substitution of arginine for threonine at amino acid 72. This base and amino acid are identical to those found at the same positions in the s haplotype.
3 The Thy-1-bearing cell of murine epidermis. A distinctive leukocyte perhaps related to natural killer cells. Bone marrow-derived leukocytes of murine epidermis can express two phenotypes: typical Langerhans cells, which are Ia+ and Thy-1-, and a recently discovered second population that is Thy-1+ and Ia-. To verify that these phenotypes are expressed by two different cell types, and to help understand their lineage and function, we have studied morphology and reactivity with a large panel of antibodies. Dual antibody immunofluorescence combined with electron microscopy showed that Thy-1+ and Ia+ cells were each distributed in a regular fashion and formed adjacent dendritic systems in or close to the basal layer. Double-labeling studies with anti-Ia and a second monoclonal antibody revealed that all Langerhans cells expressed F4/80 (macrophage), Mac-1 (C3bi receptor), and 2.4G2 (Fc receptor), as well as the thymus leukemia (TL) and heat-stable (M1.69/16) antigens. A large fraction expressed S100 and all exhibited membrane ATPase and nonspecific esterase. In contrast, Thy-1+ cells lacked all these features of Langerhans cells, except that a minority were strongly reactive with 2.4G2. Thy-1+ cells also lacked differentiation antigens of most other types of leukocytes, except they were rich in asialo GM1. By electron microscopy, Thy-1+ cells had cytoplasmic granules that were similar in structure and in their aryl sulfatase content to those previously described in natural killer cells. The granules were enlarged in beige mice, suggesting a lysosomal origin, and were present in mast cell-deficient W/Wv mice, indicating no relation to mast cells. We conclude that Thy-1+ epidermal cells are thoroughly distinct from Langerhans cells. On the basis of morphology and phenotype, they may represent a type of tissue natural killer cell. Thy-1+ natural killer cells are now being identified in several nonlymphoid sites, such as gut epithelium and the livers of mice given adjuvants. If Thy-1+ epidermal cells prove to be natural killer cells, it is noteworthy that they represent a resident population regularly distributed in the basal layer of all mouse strains. The notion that Thy-1+ epidermal cells are immature natural killer cells is intriguing in light of recent evidence that Ia+ Langerhans cells are also immature with respect to accessory cell function. The epidermis may not have the functional capacities of a lymphoid organ, but it could contribute immature cells important for both natural and acquired resistance.
0 The major histocompatibility complex class II-linked cim locus controls the kinetics of intracellular transport of a classical class I molecule. The dominant trans-acting major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked class I modifier (cim) locus, previously recognized through its ability to determine altered alloantigenicity of a rat class I molecule, RT1.A3, is shown here to influence class I intracellular transport. The MHC recombinant laboratory rat strains PVG.R1 and PVG.R8 display unusually long retention of RT1.Aa within the endoplasmic reticulum or cis-Golgi. In appropriate F1 hybrid cells heterozygous for RT1.Aa and another class I MHC allele, RT1.Ac, only the RT1.Aa protein is subject to slow transport. The cim gene product therefore shows class I allele specificity in its action, cim appears to be a polymorphic locus whose product is directly involved in the processes of class I MHC assembly and/or intracellular transport.
3 Tolerance of thymocytes to allogeneic I region determinants encountered prethymically. Evidence for expression of anti-Ia receptors by T cell precursors before their entry into the thymus. The present study has assessed whether precursor T cells express receptors specific for the recognition of allogeneic I region-encoded determinants before their entry into the thymus. Because the ability of thymocytes to proliferate in response to allogeneic stimulator cells was shown to primarily result from the recognition of allogeneic I region determinants, thymocytes must already express anti-Ia receptors. In contrast, the expression of anti- Ia receptors by functionally immature thymocyte precursors could not be directly assessed by mixed lymphocyte reaction reactivity. However, expression of anti-Ia receptors by thymocyte precursors could be assessed by their ability to be specifically tolerized by the allogeneic Ia determinants that they encountered during their differentiation. To determine whether T cell precursors could specifically recognize and be tolerized to allogeneic Ia determinants expressed prethymically, thymus- engrafted radiation bone marrow chimeras were constructed [A {arrow} A x B (Tx + A Thy)] such that strain A T cells would be differentiating within a syngeneic strain A thymus but would have been previously exposed to the allogeneic strain B Ia determinants of the irradiated A x B host. The strain A thymocytes from these experimental animals were indeed tolerant to the extrathymic allogeneic strain B Ia determinants expressed by the irradiated host. Such tolerance was not mediated by detectable suppression and was not explained by the presence intrathymically of extrathymic allogeneic Ia determinants. Thus, these results suggest that T cell precursors can be specifically tolerized entry into the thymus. In addition, the failure to detect the generation of thymocytes with specificity for the allogeneic Ia determinants of the irradiated host, which were not deleted prethymically, argues that novel anti-allo Ia receptor specificities are not generated intrathymically.
2 Organ-specific autoimmune diseases induced in mice by elimination of T cell subset. I. Evidence for the active participation of T cells in natural self-tolerance; deficit of a T cell subset as a possible cause of autoimmune disease. Organ-specific autoimmune diseases such as oophoritis, gastritis, thyroiditis, and orchitis were induced in female or male nude (nu/nu) mice by the transfer of nu/+spleen cells from which particular Lyt T cell subset(s) had been removed: nu/+spleen cells treated with anti-Lyt-1 plus complement (C) caused disease in recipient nude mice; anti-Lyt-2 plus C-treated spleen cells, in contrast, did not. The cells responsible for disease induction are believed to be Thy-1+, Lyt-1-, 2,3- (Thy-1, Lyt-1, 2,3), since spleen cells treated with mixed antisera, including anti-Lyt-1 and anti-Lyt-2, plus C, could induce the disease with almost the same incidence as anti-Lyt-1 plus C-treated cells (oophoritis 50%, gastritis 25%, thyroiditis 10-20%, and orchitis 40%). Cells treated with mixed antisera of anti-Thy-1, anti-Lyt-1, and anti-Lyt-2, plus C, could not induce autoimmune disease. Each induced autoimmune disease could be adoptively transferred to other nude mice via spleen cells, with resulting histological lesion of corresponding organs and development of specific circulating autoantibodies. Since anti-Thy-1 plus C treatment of donor spleen cells abrogated the capacity to transfer the disease, we conclude that T cells are required as effector cells, and that these may develop from Lyt-1-, 2,3- cells. Lyt-1+, 2,3- cells were demonstrated to have suppressive activity upon the development of the diseases; induction of autoimmunity was completely inhibited by the cotransfer of Lyt-1+, 2,3- cells with Lyt-1-, 2,3- cells. When anti-Lyt-2 plus C-treated cells (i.e., Lyt-1+, 2,3- and Lyt-1-, 2,3- cells) were mixed with anti-Lyt-1 and anti-Lyt-2 plus C-treated cells (i.e., Lyt-1-, 2,3- cells) in various ratios, then transferred to nude mice, the development of each autoimmune disease was clearly inhibited, even by small doses of Lyt-1+, 2,3- cells. The autoimmune disease we were able to induce was quite similar to human organ-specific autoimmune disease in terms of the spectrum of organs involved, histopathological features, and the development of autoantibodies to corresponding organ components (oocytes, parietal cells, thyroid colloid, including thyroglobulin, and sperm).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3 Essential role of the interleukin 2-interleukin 2 receptor pathway in thymocyte maturation in vivo. The role of the IL-2-IL-2-R pathway in thymocyte differentiation in vivo is unknown. We have examined fetal thymocyte development in vivo, under conditions where all IL-2-R were saturated from day 13 of gestation with anti-IL-2-R mAbs that were previously shown to render mature T cells unable to respond to IL-2. This produced a dramatic change in the composition of developing T cells: thymocytes from day 1 neonatal mice born to anti-IL-2-R-treated mothers did not contain CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive cell populations. In addition, no generation of surface TCR beta chain-expressing T cells or antigen-reactive functional T cells occurred in treated mice. These data suggest that IL-2-IL-2-R interactions provide signals crucial to in vivo intrathymic development of mature T cells.
3 Synergistic and suppressive interactions among mouse T lymphocytes in the response to phytohemagglutinin. A synergistic effect in the proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) can be observed in cultures containing a mixture of mouse CBA/Ca lymph node cells (LNC) and syngeneic CBA/T6T6 thymocytes (ThC) when compared to cultures containing only one cell type. This effect was analyzed, at various days of culture and in LNC-ThC mixtures of different ratios, by comparing the origin of the cells in mitosis (detected by caryotypic analysis), the stimulation of DNA synthesis, the number of blasts, and the percentage of blasts labeled after pulses of [3H]thymidine (detected by autoradiography). The following conclusions were reached: (a) ThC are induced to proliferate by the presence of LNC, while they are almost unresponsive to PHA when cultured alone; and (b) the strongest "synergistic" effect is exerted on LNC, whose proliferation is markedly enhanced. Evidence is presented that this last effect is not specific to the presence of ThC, but results from a dilution of LNC which retards the time when the culture reaches a critical concentration of blasts, above which proliferation progressively stops. Thus, conditions of culture allowing the response to PHA of a low concentration of LNC leads to the most prolonged T-cell proliferation. These observations may be relevant to the types of T-cell interactions, "synergistic" or "suppressive," occurring during in vitro or in vivo immune responses.
3 Functional analysis of human T cell subsets defined by monoclonal antibodies. IV. Induction of suppressor cells within the OKT4+ population. In this report, we explored the functional heterogeneity within the OKT4+ subset of human T cells. Evidence was obtained that although in vitro pokeweed mitogen-activated OKT4+ cells can function as radioresistant helper cells, these activated OKT4+ cells could also exert potent feedback suppression. Despite the induction of suppressor cells after pokeweed mitogen activation, the OKT4+ population maintains its original OKT3+, OKT4+, nd OKT8- surface phenotype. The suppressor cells contained within the activated OKT4+ population were found to be radiosensitive. Importantly, the suppression mediated by activated OKT4+ cells required the presence of radiosensitive cells contained within the resting OKT4+ population. Taken together, these results suggest that the OKT4+ subset of human T cells contains cells that can be activated to differentiate into suppressor cells independent of OKT8+ cells.
3 Inhibition of bone marrow colony formation by human natural killer cells and by natural killer cell-derived colony-inhibiting activity. Incubation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes with bone marrow cells resulted in significant inhibition of colony formation by committed myeloid and erythroid cells. Using positively selected homogeneous natural killer (NK) cell preparations and lymphocyte subpopulations depleted of or enriched for NK cells, we definitively characterize as NK cells the cells in normal peripheral blood that are responsible for inhibition of bone marrow colony growth. The inhibitory effect of NK cells on hematopoiesis can be mediated by a soluble factor that is produced only by NK cells upon culture with HLA-DR+ hematopoietic cells and with NK-sensitive cell lines. Both NK cells and the NK-produced, colony-inhibiting activity (NK-CIA) are suppressive for allogeneic and autologous bone marrow CFU-GEMM (colony-forming units, granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte), CFU-E (CFU, erythroid), and early CFU-GM (CFU, granulocyte, monocyte), but not for either BFU-E (burst-forming units, erythroid) or late CFU-GM. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was inhibited by NK-CIA-containing supernatants in HLA-DR+ but not HLA-DR- bone marrow cell populations stimulated to proliferative by colony-stimulating factor (CSF). These data suggest that the NK cell-mediated inhibitory effect on proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells is mediated in part or completely by the secreted NK-CIA. The concentration of NK-CIA reached in the supernatant of the mixture of NK cell-containing lymphocyte populations with bone marrow cells is sufficient to account for the inhibitory effect mediated by NK cells. Our data support the hypothesis that human NK cells play a major role in the control of hematopoiesis, down-regulating it under conditions in which the NK cells are functionally activated.
2 Expression of tumor necrosis factor by different tumor cell lines results either in tumor suppression or augmented metastasis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) produced by tumor cells after gene transfer can effectively suppress the growth of locally growing tumors. We wanted to test the effects of "local" TNF on the growth of a highly metastatic cell line. Therefore, a recombinant retrovirus allowing expression of the TNF gene by the beta-actin promotor has been constructed and used to infect the two tumor cell lines EB and ESB, which grow as solid tumor or metastasize, respectively. Expression of TNF by EB cells resulted in their rapid and dose-dependent rejection. In sharp contrast, mice injected with ESB cells producing similar amounts of TNF showed no signs of tumor suppression, but rather had reduced survival rates that correlated with enhanced hepatic metastases. The accelerated formation of liver metastases by ESB TNF cells could be reversed by an anti-TNF mAb. These results demonstrate the opposite effects TNF may have on tumor growth: suppression of a locally growing tumor and promotion of metastasis formation.
3 Identification of the membrane glycoprotein that is the C3b receptor of the human erythrocyte, polymorphonuclear leukocyte, B lymphocyte, and monocyte. A human erythrocyte membrane glycoprotein of 205,000 mol wt (gp205) has been identified as the C3b receptor of the erythrocyte, polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN), B lymphocyte, and monocyte. Initially, gp205 was sought and characterized as a constituent of the human erythrocyte membrane that can impair activation of the alternative complement pathway by inducing loss of function of the properdin-stabilized amplification C3 convertase (C3b,Bb,P) through displacement of Bb from C3b and by promoting cleavage-inactivation of C3b by C3b inactivator. These inhibitory activities of gp205 suggested that this membrane glyeoprotein had an affinity for C3b and prompted an analysis of its possible identity as the C3b receptor of human peripheral blood cells. The F(ab')2 fragment of rabbit IgG anti-gp205 inhibited the formation of rosettes with sheep EC3b of human erythroeytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes and PMN in a dose-response manner; the 50 percent inhibitory doses were 0.13/mug/ml, 0.90 mug/ml, 1.25 mug/ml, and 1.20 mug/ml of F(ab')2, respectively. Anti-gp205 did not impair the formation of rosettes by monocytes and B lymphocytes with sheep EC3bi or with EC3d. Scatchard analysis of the number of specific (125)I-F(ab')(2) anti-gp205 binding sites/cell revealed 950 sites/erythrocyte, 21,000 sites/cell of B lymphocyte preparation, 57,000 sites/PMN, and 48,000 sites/monocyte, indicating that the higher concentrations of antibody that had been required for inhibition of rosette formation by the nucleated cells reflected larger numbers of receptors on these cells. Direct evidence for the identity of gp205 as the C3b receptor of the four cell types was obtained when detergent-solubilized membrane proteins of the surface-radioiodinated cells were reacted with anti- gp205 and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. In each instance, the antigenic material reacting with anti-gp205 represented a single protein with an apparent 205,000 mol wt. Thus, gp205 is the C3b receptor of human erythrocytes, PMN, B lymphocytes, and monocytes.
3 Genetic control of immunoregulatory circuits. Genes linked to the Ig locus govern communication between regulatory T-cell sets. Antigen-stimulated Ly1:Qa1+ cells induce a nonimmune set of T-acceptor cells (surface phenotype Ly123+Qa1+) to participate in the generation of specific suppressive activity. The experiments reported here were designed to test the possibility that the interaction between T-inducer and T-acceptor cells might be governed by genes linked to the Ig locus. We find that inducer:acceptor interactions occur only if the inducer and acceptor T-cell sets are obtained from donor that are identical at the Ig locus and are independent of the Ig locus expressed on the B cells used for assay of T-helper activity. In addition, experiments using inducer and acceptor T cells from the congenic recombinant BAB. 14 strain show that T-T interactions are not governed by Ig-CH genes, per se. These data indicate that T-inducer: T-acceptor interactions are governed by Ig-linked genes that may control expression of VH-like structures on T cells, or control expression of as yet unidentified cell-surface molecules.
3 Kirsten murine sarcoma virus abolishes interferon gamma-induced class II but not class I major histocompatibility antigen expression in a murine fibroblast line. The effect of infecting fibroblasts with Kirsten murine sarcoma virus/murine leukemia virus (Ki-MSV/MLV) on constitutive and IFN-gamma-induced H-2 antigen expression was investigated. The fibroblasts used were two established cell lines (C3H10T1/2 and BALB/c3T3) and fresh embryo fibroblasts from C3H mice. Class I antigens were expressed constitutively by BALB/c3T3; infection with MLV, MSV or the two together had little effect on this constitutive expression. Class I antigens (H-2K, H-2D) were strongly induced on all three types of fibroblast by rIFN-gamma, and infection had little effect on this. None of the fibroblasts expressed constitutively detectable levels of class II antigen; however, C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts could be induced for both H-2A and H-2E by IFN-gamma. Infection of C3H10T1/2 with helper-free Ki-MSV, or MSV together with MLV, completely abolished this induction of class II antigens, while infection with MLV alone had little effect, implying that the abolition of class II induction was due to genomic regions of Ki-MSV not shared with Ki-MLV, probably the v-Ki-ras gene.
0 Physiology of IgD. I. Compensatory phenomena in B lymphocyte activation in mice treated with anti-IgD antibodies. The role of delta-positive cells in the immune response was studied by comparing the effects of treatment with allotype-specific IgD hybridoma antibody on homozygous BALB/c or SJL/J and heterozygous (BALB x SJL)F1 mice. Homozygous mice, injected from birth with the relevant anti-delta antibody, made primary or secondary immune responses to intravenously injected trinitrophenyl (TNP)-Brucella abortus, TNP-Ficoll, and TNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin, which did not differ significantly from those of control mice, despite the fact that IgD+ cells were depleted and Ig+ cells were markedly reduced in the spleens of treated mice. Responses in nodes draining a local injection of TNP-Brucella abortus were, however, significantly suppressed. Heterozygous mice, injected from birth with either anti-Ig-5a or anti-Ig-5b, showed a marked reduction in the number cells producing IgG antibody of linked allotype specificity in the secondary response to intravenously injected sheep erythrocytes. A corresponding decrease in the amount of serum IgG2a of that allotype specificity was also noted. However, in agreement with the results obtained in homozygotes, heterozygotes injected simultaneously with anti-IgD directed against each of the allotypes made normal, if not enhanced, plaque-forming cell responses of both allotype specificities. Similarly, serum IgG2a levels were normal in all but one mouse treated in this fashion. These results indicate that IgD+ cells are not essential for an immune response in vivo. Although the delta-positive cell is used preferentially under normal conditions, it appears that an alternative mechanism exists by which, in the absence of these cells, the animal is able to make a normal immune response.
3 T cell receptor V beta gene usage in a human alloreactive response. Shared structural features among HLA-B27-specific T cell clones. A strategy, based on using V beta family-specific oligonucleotides, was developed for specific amplification and direct sequencing of human TCR V beta genes. With this strategy, it was possible to undertake a structural analysis of TCRs from human T cell clones in specific responses. 12 HLA-B27-specific cytotoxic clones were examined. The results reveal a nonrandom use of V beta gene diversity in this alloreactive response in that: (a) the clones express a restricted number of V beta segments, including a subset of V beta families that are significantly more related to one another than to most other V beta families; (b) five of seven clones having a particular reaction pattern with HLA-B27 subtypes possess Alanine at the D-J junction; and (c) identical J beta segments are found associated in several instances with identical or highly homologous V beta gene segments. In addition, two new V beta 13 members are reported.
0 Mechanism responsible for the induction of I-J restriction on TS3 suppressor cells. The mechanisms responsible for the induction of I-J restrictions on third-order suppressor T cells (TS3) were analyzed. The I-J phenotype of the antigen-coupled cells used for priming restricted the specificity of the TS3 population. Thus, TS3 cells were only generated after priming with antigen-coupled I-J homologous cells. Identity at the I-JM (and I-E) subregions was sufficient for TS3 induction. Furthermore, priming of H-2 heterozygous mice with antigen-coupled parental cells generated TS3 that were restricted to the parental haplotype used for priming. The splenic cell population responsible for antigen presentation and induction of TS3 cells was fractionated. The cells involved in antigen presentation were found in the splenic adherent population and were absent in the fraction containing splenic nonadherent T and B cells. The subsequent activation and interaction of TS3 cells is also restricted by genes in the H-2 complex. The results are discussed in terms of a general mechanism responsible for the induction of restrictions in T helper and TS3 cells.
0 Structure and expression of human germline VH transcripts. The human VH5 family consists of two functional genes and one pseudogene. We have found a novel 1.2-kb VH5 gene transcript in normal fetal liver and cord blood and in transformed B lineage cells. VH5-positive cDNA clones were isolated from precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, Epstein-Barr Virus-transformed B cell lines, and cord blood, and were identified as transcripts of unrearranged VH5 genes (germline transcripts). The cDNA clones were derived from both functional and pseudo-VH5 genes. Most germline transcripts appear to initiate at the normal VH promoter and are cleaved and polyadenylated at sites several hundred bases downstream of the VH5 coding region. Correct splicing of the leader intron was observed in all clones. In functional and pseudo-VH5 cDNAs, an open translational reading frame extends from the leader to a termination codon in the nonamer. Only limited polymorphisms were observed in the coding as well as flanking regions of the VH5 transcripts. Functional and pseudo-VH5 transcripts and previously identified murine germline VHJ558 transcripts are discussed.
3 Autoantibodies against alanyl-tRNA synthetase and tRNAAla coexist and are associated with myositis. The sera of six patients with autoimmune disease, predominantly myositis with pulmonary fibrosis, contain antibodies of the PL-12 specificity. These autoantibodies react with both protein and RNA components of human cells. The protein has a subunit molecular mass of 110 kD, and the RNA comprises a group of bands in the tRNA size class. Aminoacylation experiments identify the antigens as alanyl-tRNA synthetase and its corresponding tRNAs, tRNAAla. Anti-tRNA antibody can be absorbed out without depleting antisynthetase activity, showing that the antigens are recognized independently by separable antibodies that coexist in these sera. The concurrence of separate antibodies to the two components suggests that the autoimmune response may be mounted against the charging enzyme-tRNA complex. However, the antisynthetase antibody fails to coprecipitate tRNA with the enzyme, suggesting that the antibody reacts with its target only when it is not complexed with tRNA.
3 A surface receptor specific for human IgA on group B streptococci possessing the Ibc protein antigen. A number of group B streptococcal strains of various serotypes, Ia, Ib, Ic, II, and III were examined for their ability to bind human IgG and IgA. No strains of group B streptococci were found to bind IgG, but many strains possessing the Ibc protein antigen(s) were found to bind a significant amount of IgA. The extent of IgA binding correlated with the amount of a 130,000 mol wt, detergent-extractable protein, and reactivity with the Ic typing sera. Using nitrocellulose blots, it was found that the 130,000 mol wt protein bound human IgA. A method was developed to purify the protein while retaining its ability to bind human IgA. Using solid phase radioimmunoassays, it was determined that the protein bound to the Fc region of monomeric or polymeric IgA and that it failed to bind IgM or any IgG isotype.
2 Genetic regulation of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to poly(LTyr,LGu)-poly(DLAla)--poly(LLys). I. Expression of the genetic defect at two phases of the immune process. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses served in this study as an experimental model for the analysis of genetic regulations of T-cell responses. Educated irradiated cells from H-2b mice mediated responses in syngeneic recipients, whereas mice of the a, d, f, k, and s haplotypes were nonresponders to poly(LTyr,LGlu)-poly(DLAla)--poly(LLys)[(T,G)-A--L]. These results suggest that cell-mediated immune responsiveness to (T,G)-A--L is linked to the H-2 complex, as was shown for humoral responses. Educated irradiated T cells of F1 hybrids between high and low responders mediated DTH responses, which indicates that the gene(s) controlling the DTH responses is dominant. To analyze the genetic defect in DTH responses to (T,G)-A--L, we separated the T-cell activation phase from the effector phase that was determined in recipient mice. Two types of nonresponders were observed: (a) When lymphocytes of the a or k haplotypes were educated in a syngeneic environment and then transferred into hybrids between the parental (nonresponder x responder) F1 recipients, DTH responses could have been manifested. (b) On the other hand, no DTH responses could be mediated by transferring educated cells of the H-2s or H-2f origin into the appropriate F1 recipients. In addition, irradiated F1 cells that had been activated to (T,G)-A--L could not mediate DTH responses in both types of nonresponder recipients. These results suggest that T cells of H-2k or H-2a mice can be activated to generate DTH responses to (T,G)-A--L and that the defect in these mouse strains is expressed in another cell population needed for the manifestation of the DTH reaction in the recipient mice. In contrast, T cells of H-2s and H-2f origin cannot be activated to (T,G)-A--L and, thus, fail to manifest DTH responses.
1 Relationship between expression of herpes simplex virus glycoproteins and susceptibility of target cells to human natural killer activity. Cells normally insensitive to human natural killer (NK) activity were rendered susceptible by infection with HSV-1. The cytotoxic effector cell was a nonadherent, non-T, non-B lymphocyte. Antibody plus complement treatment, using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an antigen present on NK cells, removed much of the cytotoxic activity, and a density gradient fraction enriched for NK cells yielded cells of increased virus-specific cytotoxicity. It was concluded that the effector cell active against infected targets possessed characteristics of an NK cell. Blockage of viral protein synthesis during infection inhibited development of increased susceptibility of infected targets to NK activity. When targets were infected with a mutant virus unable to produce viral glycoprotein C (gC), NK activity against these targets was reduced approximately 30% compared with activity against targets infected with wild-type virus. Similarly, activity against targets infected in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose (2dG), which prevents cell surface expression of viral glycoprotein B (gB), was also reduced approximately 30%. An approximately 60% reduction in activity was seen against targets infected with mutant virus in the presence of 2dG; these targets express gD, but neither gB nor gC. When cells expressing various combinations of HSV-1 glycoproteins were used as both labeled targets and cold target competitors, it was found that the susceptibility of a particular target to NK activity was paralleled by its ability to act as a cold target competitor. This indicates that targets with decreased sensitivity to NK cells were less able to bind NK effectors. Further, the amount of interferon produced in co-cultures of NK effectors and infected target cells did not directly correlate with the amount of NK activity generated, and interferon pretreatment of effectors did not decrease virus-specific cytotoxicity. The present results suggest that HSV-1 glycoproteins expressed at the surface of infected targets may act as recognition structures for NK cells.
3 The requirement for membrane sialic acid in the stimulation of superoxide production during phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The effect of desialylation on phagocytosis of latex particles and oxidative metabolism of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was studied. Removal of 20% total leukocyte sialic acid by bacterial neuraminidase had no effect on phagocytosis of latex particles and phagocytosis-associated activation of hexose monophosphate shunt in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In contrast, desialylation prevented the stimulation of superoxide production either by phagocytosis or by concanavalin A. It is concluded that membrane sialic acid is essential for the stimulation of superoxide production by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
2 Schistosoma mansoni. Anti-egg monoclonal antibodies protect against cercarial challenge in vivo. Monoclonal antibodies that bind to surface membranes of developing schistosomula and/or cercarial tails were generated from mice immunized with living schistosome eggs or soluble egg antigen. These monoclonal antibodies detected at least three different surface epitopes. One surface antigen detected by anti-egg monoclonal antibody EG1C4B1 (E.1) persisted on the surface of developing schistosomula for 96 h posttransformation . The same or a cross-reactive antigen was also detected on the surfaces of S. japonicum and S. haematobium schistosomula and cercarial tails. Monoclonal antibody E.1 killed schistosomula in vitro as well or better than infected mouse sera and transferred immunity to naive mice when administered in vivo. The monoclonal antibody reduced the number of lung worms recoverable on day 4 postchallenge by up to 85% and reduced the adult worm burden up to 41% as compared with controls. The data also show that the molecular weights of the egg antigens detected by monoclonal antibody E.1 were different from those detected on schistosomula.
1 IgM anti-Fc gamma R autoantibodies trigger neutrophil degranulation. Anti-Fc gamma R IgM monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated spleen cells from tightskin (TSK) mice were found to be polyspecific, reacting with a wide variety of molecules, including double-stranded DNA, topoisomerase, RNA polymerase, and different collagen types. Approximately 60% of the polyspecific IgM mAbs have anti-Fc gamma R specificity. These anti-Fc gamma R mAbs induce the release of hydrolases from both azurophil and specific granules of human neutrophils. 25-45% of the total cellular content (determined in Nonidet P-40 lysates) of neutrophil elastase, 10-25% of beta-glucuronidase, and 30-50% of alkaline phosphatase was released after incubation with the mAbs. The degranulation process was accompanied by dramatic morphological changes shown by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The release of hydrolytic enzymes stimulated by the IgM anti-Fc gamma R mAbs was inhibited by preincubation of neutrophils with Fab fragments of either anti-human Fc gamma RII (IV.3) or anti-human Fc gamma RIII (3G8) mAbs. The binding of the anti-Fc gamma R TSK mAbs to human neutrophils was inhibited by Fab fragments of mAb 3G8. However, we found that the TSK anti-Fc gamma R mAbs do not bind to human Fc gamma RII expressed in either CHO cells or the P388D1 mouse macrophage cell line. Since the enzyme release could be inhibited by Fab fragments of mAb IV.3, we suggest that the signal transduction may require Fc gamma RII activation subsequent to crosslinking of the glycan phosphatidyl inositol-anchored Fc gamma RIII-1. These data demonstrate for the first time that polyspecific autoantibodies with Fc gamma R specificity can trigger neutrophil enzyme release via human Fc gamma RIII-1 in vitro and indicate a possible role for such autoantibodies in autoimmune inflammatory processes.
3 A transmissible avian neoplasm. (Sarcoma of the common fowl) by Peyton Rous, M.D., Experimental Medicine for Sept. 1, 1910, vol. 12, pp.696-705. In this paper is reported the first avian tumor that has proved transplantable to other individuals. It is a spindle-celled sarcoma of the hen, which thus far has been propagated into its fourth tumor generation. This was accomplished by the use of fowls of pure blood from the small, intimately related stock in which the growth occurred. Market-bought fowls of similar variety have shown themselves insusceptible, as have fowls of mixed breed, pigeons and guinea-pigs. The percentage of successful transplantations has been small, but in the individuals developing a tumor its growth has been fairly rapid. Young chickens are more susceptible than adults. The reinoculation of negative fowls has never resulted in a growth. Throughout, the sarcoma has remained true to type. It is infiltrative and destructive. Metastasis has been observed once (to the heart). Experiments to determine whether the growth may be transmitted by cell-fragments have not yet been made. Repeated bacteriological examinations have yielded negative results. In its general behavior, so far as tested, this avian tumor closely resembles the typical mammalian neoplasms that are transplantable.
1 Interferon alpha associated with systemic lupus erythematosus is not intrinsically acid labile. The physicochemical properties of apparently acid-labile IFN-alpha from patients with SLE have been studied. The antigenicity, apparent molecular size, and isoelectric point of SLE IFN-alpha are indistinguishable from those of conventional, previously characterized, acid-stable subspecies of IFN-alpha. However, after partial purification by anion-exchange chromatography, SLE IFN-alpha no longer exhibits acid lability, suggesting that other plasma factor(s) are responsible for the acid lability of SLE IFN-alpha. Addition of SLE plasma, but not normal plasma, to conventional acid-stable IFN-alpha renders the exogenous IFN-alpha acid labile. Preliminary results demonstrate that an acid-dependent IFN-inactivating activity can be partially purified from SLE plasma by anion-exchange chromatography.
3 Primary cell-mediated lympholysis response to a maternally transmitted antigen. Mta-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) can be generated in primary cultures of (NZB X B10.D2)F1 spleen cells with H-2-compatible BALB/c stimulator cells. The CTL lyse reciprocal Mta+ (B10.D2 X NZB)F1 as well as H-2-disparate targets, such as B10, B6, and B6-Tlaa; they do not lyse targets from NZB or any F1 hybrid of an NZB mother. The lysis of 51Cr-labeled B10 targets is completely inhibited by unlabeled targets from Mta+ (B10.D2 X NZB)F1, but not from the reciprocal Mta- F1, thus demonstrating H-2-unrestricted lysis of Mta.
3 Differences in maternal lineages of New Zealand Black mice defined by restriction endonuclease analysis of mitochondrial DNA and by expression of maternally transmitted antigen. Two substrains of New Zealand Black (NZB) mice have been compared with respect to expression of a maternally transmitted cell surface antigen, Mta, defined by cloned cytolytic T cells, and for restriction enzyme polymorphisms of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These independent assays of maternal cytoplasmic inheritance provide strong evidence for genetic contamination of the NZB/BlPt substrain (NZB/Bl mice from Michael Potter's separate colony at the National Institutes of Health), in which the typical NZB immunologic abnormalities are at least partially ameliorated. The decisive data are the restriction enzyme maps of mtDNA for NZB/BlPt, which were identical with those of the common "old inbred" strains and quite different from those of NZB/BlN (NZB/Bl mice from the breeding facility at the National Institutes of Health). It is probable that the contamination of the NZB/BlPt substrain is related to phenotypic changes in their autoimmune state. More interestingly, the data are consistent with, although they do not prove, involvement of the mitochondrial genome in expression of a cell surface molecule.
3 Qat-4 and Qat-5, new murine T-cell antigens governed by the Tla region and identified by monoclonal antibodies. Two new lymphocyte antigens, provisionally designated Qat-4 and Qat-5 have been identified with two different hybridoma-derived, monoclonal AKR antiC57BL/6 antibodies. These antigens are governed by genes located to the right (distal) end of the H-2 complex, within the Qa-2,3 region. Qat-4 and Qat-5 antigens which do not seem to be identical with Qa-2,3 or TL antigens are absent from Ig/ lymphocytes and thymocytes. They are only present on a fraction of peripheral T cells. Thus, Qat-4 is expressed on 70%, and Qat-5 on 30% of splenic and lymph node T cells, Qat-4 is also found on the majority of Ig- cells from athymic nude mice. These findings illustrate the complexity of the chromosome segment between the H-2D and Tla loci and they emphasize the role of major histocompatibility complex-associated genes for the differentiation of T cells into different subpopulations with possibly distinct immunologic functions.
3 HLA-A31- and HLA-Aw68-restricted cytotoxic T cell responses to a single hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid epitope during acute viral hepatitis. We have recently developed the technology to identify and characterize the human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-restricted, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded antigens in patients with acute viral hepatitis. CTL are expanded in vitro by stimulation with HBV-derived synthetic peptides and selected by restimulation with a panel of HLA-matched stable transfectants that express the corresponding HBV protein. We have recently reported the existence of an HLA-A2-restricted, CD8+ CTL response to an epitope located between residues 18 and 27 of the HBV nucleocapsid core antigen (HBcAg). We now report the discovery of a CTL epitope located between HBcAg residues 141 and 151 that completely overlaps a critical domain in the viral nucleocapsid protein that is essential for its nuclear localization and genome packaging functions as well as processing of the precore protein. The CTL response to this epitope is dually restricted by the HLA-A31 and HLA-Aw68 alleles, which, unexpectedly, appear to use a common binding motif based on the results of alanine substitution and competition analysis, and the binding properties of these two alleles predicted from their known primary sequence, and from the three-dimensional structure of HLA-Aw68. We have also demonstrated that the HBV-specific CTL response to this epitope is polyclonal during acute viral hepatitis, since these two restriction elements can present the HBcAg 141-151 epitope to independent CTL clones derived from a single patient; and that the CTL response is multispecific, since HLA-A2-restricted and HLA-Aw68-restricted CTL responses to HBcAg 18-27 and HBcAg 141-151, respectively, have been identified to coexist in another patient. The foregoing argue against the emergence of CTL escape mutants as a significant problem during HBV infection, especially at this locus, where mutations might be incompatible with viral replication. Finally, our data suggest an association between the HBV-specific CTL response and viral clearance, and they have implications for the design of immunotherapeutic strategies to terminate HBV infection in chronically infected patients.
1 Human autologous mixed lymphocyte reactivity is primarily specific for xenoprotein determinants adsorbed to antigen-presenting cells during rosette formation with sheep erythrocytes. We present evidence that most T cells proliferating in response to autologous sheep erythrocyte (SRBC)-separated non-T cells (NT) cells are not specific for autoantigens but for antigens derived from xenogeneic sources. The conclusion was based on the following three observations. First, we found that NT cells isolated in the absence of xenoproteins by means of density gradient centrifugation on Percoll only weakly stimulated autologous T cells. Because this weak proliferation could not be expanded in restimulation experiments, its significance as an immune recognitive event remains questionable. NT cells isolated by the above method in the absence of xenogeneic determinants readily acquired stimulatory capacity after brief exposure to either SRBC or fetal calf serum. Second, restimulation of T memory cells generated in 1 degree autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR) against SRBC-separated autologous NT cells was exclusively seen when NT cells exposed to or separated with xenoproteins were used for restimulation. Third, T memory cells generated against SRBC-separated autologous NT cells were specifically restimulated by autologous Percoll-separated NT cells that had been pulsed with a variety of xenogeneic mammalian sera. These xenogeneic determinants were preferentially recognized in context with autologous HLA-DR+ cells. From these findings and from our previous results that indicated an absolute requirement of HLA-DR+-adherent NT cells (8), we conclude that human AMLR primarily does not represent an autoantigen but a xenoantigen response that is genetically restricted by the HLA-DR type of the antigen-presenting cell.
3 Insights into the dynamic properties of keratin intermediate filaments in living epithelial cells. The properties of keratin intermediate filaments (IFs) have been studied after transfection with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged K18 and/or K8 (type I/II IF proteins). GFP-K8 and -K18 become incorporated into tonofibrils, which are comprised of bundles of keratin IFs. These tonofibrils exhibit a remarkably wide range of motile and dynamic activities. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analyses show that they recover their fluorescence slowly with a recovery t(1/2) of approximately 100 min. The movements of bleach zones during recovery show that closely spaced tonofibrils (<1 microm apart) often move at different rates and in different directions. Individual tonofibrils frequently change their shapes, and in some cases these changes appear as propagated waveforms along their long axes. In addition, short fibrils, termed keratin squiggles, are seen at the cell periphery where they move mainly towards the cell center. The motile properties of keratin IFs are also compared with those of type III IFs (vimentin) in PtK2 cells. Intriguingly, the dynamic properties of keratin tonofibrils and squiggles are dramatically different from those of vimentin fibrils and squiggles within the same cytoplasmic regions. This suggests that there are different factors regulating the dynamic properties of different types of IFs within the same cytoplasmic regions.
1 Secondary cell-mediated lympholysis: importance of H-2 LD and SD factors. Lymphocytes stimulated in mixed leukocyte cultures and left for 13-17 days, i.e. beyond their peak proliferative and cytotoxic reactivities, can be restimulated to give a secondary-type rapid and strong proliferative and cytotoxic response when confronted with cells of the original sensitizing cell donor. We have concerned ourselves primarily with the requirements of restimulation for the presence of LD and/or SD stimuli on the restimulating cells. (a) The low level cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) associated with LD differences in a primary CML can be restimulated to give a secondary-type response by those same LD antigens. (b) If the original sensitizing cells differ from the responding cells by both LD and SD antigens, restimulation with only the LD antigens, or third-party cells presumably carrying cross-reactive LD antigens, can restimulate the secondary CML responses directed against the SD antigens on the original sensitizing cells. (c) The presence of SD antigens on the restimulating cells that are cross-reactive with the primary sensitizing SD antigens (as determined in a primary CML) leads to the preferential activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive to those antigens although maximum cytotoxicity is still directed at cells carrying the original sensitizing SD antigens. A model to explain these results is presented.
3 Protective and heart-crossreactive epitopes located within the NH2 terminus of type 19 streptococcal M protein. M protein was purified to homogeneity from limited pepsin digests of intact type 19 streptococci (pep M19). The purified pep M19 when emulsified in CFA and injected into rabbits evoked type-specific and crossreactive opsonic antibodies, as well as heart-crossreactive antibodies. The NH2-terminal primary structure of pep M19 was determined and a peptide copying the first 24 amino acids [SM19(1-24)C] was chemically synthesized. Rabbits that were immunized with the unconjugated peptide developed antibodies that recognized the native pep M19, as determined by ELISA, and opsonic antibodies against type 19 streptococci, as determined by in vitro opsonophagocytosis tests. The synthetic peptide also evoked antibodies that crossreacted with a 60-kD sarcolemmal membrane protein of human myocardium. By using overlapping synthetic subpeptides as immunoinhibitors, the opsonic and heart-crossreactive epitopes of SM19(1-24)C were localized to SM19(11-24)C. Our data confirm the presence of heart-crossreactive epitopes within the primary structure of pep M19 and show that these potentially harmful autoimmune epitopes may be located in the NH2-terminal regions of certain M proteins. We conclude that continued efforts to identify the primary structures of protective and heart-crossreactive epitopes will be necessary to elucidate the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic heart disease and to develop safe and effective streptococcal vaccines.
3 Demonstration of a third structurally distinct human Ia beta chain by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Previous studies have indicated that HLA-DR homozygous cell lines express two Ia alpha and Ia beta chains that combine to form at least two Ia molecules. This report demonstrates by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis the existence of a third structurally distinct human Ia beta chain on DR2 and DR5 cell lines. This suggests that at least five separate genes control the expression of Ia molecules on HLA-DR homozygous cell lines.
3 Clonal growth of hamster free alveolar cells in soft agar. Free alveolar cells obtained from healthy unstimulated hamsters were tested for their ability to form colonies in soft agar. Every bronchial washing so far tested contained colon-forming cells. The average plating efficiency was 8.1% (2.4-18.3%). Alveolar colony-forming cells were characterized by having a long initial lag period (4-8 days) and only mononuclear phagocytes were found in the colony. Medium conditioned by baby hamster kidney cells or other cells was required for the initiation and maintenance of their growth. Alveolar cells from normal mice and rats also formed colonies under appropriate culture conditions.
3 Accessory cells in murine Peyer's patch. I. Identification and enrichment of a functional dendritic cell. Previous studies have suggested that in vitro and in vivo immune responses are defective in Peyer's patch (PP) as a result of a deficiency in accessory cell number or function. However, we report here that enzymatic dissociation of PP does release a cell population with accessory activity in oxidative mitogenesis, i.e., the proliferation of periodate-modified T cells. The accessory activity present in PP is quantitatively similar to that of spleen. Accessory function is mediated by a cell type(s) that has the following characteristics: low buoyant density, lack of adherence to plastic or glass surfaces, lack of Fc receptors, and presence of surface Ia and the 33D1 dendritic cell (DC)-specific determinants. This PP accessory cell was markedly enriched by a novel technique. PP cells formed large aggregates when cultured for 16 h with irradiated, periodate-treated spleen cells. From the clusters we obtained a low density cell population that was 60% Ia positive, 33D1 positive, non-T and non-B, Fc receptor-negative, and dendritic in morphology. The DC-enriched populations were 60-80-fold enriched in accessory function relative to unfractionated PP. We can now compare PP accessory cells with accessory cells from other organs, and try to determine how PP dendritic cells contribute to the unique functions of this lymphoid organ.
3 CD16. Developmentally regulated IgG Fc receptors on cultured human monocytes. We have demonstrated that one Fc receptor for IgG (FcR) (CD16) on cultured human monocytes appears to be a developmentally regulated membrane protein. This receptor appears to contain less carbohydrate (if any) than does its counterpart on human neutrophils. Expression of CD16 on cultured monocytes increases with respect to both percentage of positive cells and numbers of sites per cell with length of time in culture. This was in contrast to expression of other types of FcRs that either decreased (CDw32) or did not change (FcRp72). Unlike an FcR that binds monomeric IgG (FcRp72), expression of CD16 on monocytes from most normal individuals was not influenced by IFN-gamma. After 14 d in culture, CD16 appeared to be the predominant FcR on cultured monocytes, and was capable of mediating both ligand attachment and phagocytosis. These findings support the hypothesis that CD16 plays an important role in mediating immunophagocytosis.
2 Prolonged survival of actively enhanced rat renal allografts despite accelerated cellular infiltration and rapid induction of both class I and class II MHC antigens. Administration of 1 ml of donor whole blood 7 d before renal transplantation produces long-term (greater than 100 d) graft survival in the DA (RT1a) into PVG (RT1c) rat strain combination. Using this model, the pattern and phenotype of infiltrating leukocytes were examined in rejecting and enhanced renal allografts, at days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after transplantation, by immunohistologic techniques. Paradoxically, enhanced grafts showed a more rapid and substantial leukocyte infiltrate, the phenotype of which was similar to that in rejecting grafts except for a reduced number of MRC OX-8+ cells and MRC OX-39+ cells. Graft infiltrating cells and splenocytes from transfused animals showed similar, although modest, levels of both nonspecific cytotoxicity and alloantigen-specific cytotoxicity. Immunohistologic analysis of MHC antigen distribution within the allograft revealed, unexpectedly, that enhanced grafts underwent an accelerated and extensive induction of both donor class I and class II MHC antigens. These findings were confirmed by allospecific quantitative absorption analysis, which showed severalfold increases in class I and class II MHC antigens by day 3 in enhanced grafts but not until day 5 in rejecting grafts. An additional observation was the more rapid disappearance of donor interstitial cells from enhanced grafts. These findings emphasize the overwhelming suppressive effect induced by an organ allograft after preoperative blood transfusion despite the associated induction of large numbers of potential effector cells and increased target antigen density within the graft.
2 Multiple cancers. Tumor burden permits the outgrowth of other cancers. We demonstrate that tumor-bearing hosts permit the outgrowth of "potentially malignant" cells that are located at a different site. These second cancers continued to grow and kill their hosts even though they retain the "premalignant" phenotype, even after removal of the original malignancy. The potentially malignant cells used in these experiments were ultraviolet light- or methylcholanthrene-induced regressor tumor cells that are rejected regularly by normal mice at any testable dose, and only form progressive tumors in immunosuppressed individuals. The immunological rejection of these highly immunogenic, potentially malignant cells was suppressed by Thy-1+, Ly-2-, nonadherent, radio-sensitive suppressor cells in the tumor-bearing mice. These suppressor cells were absent in nude tumor-bearing mice. Unlike helper and cytolytic T cell-mediated responses, which are exquisitely tumor specific, the suppression caused by a progressively growing tumor was crossreactive among many syngeneic, independently derived tumors induced by different carcinogens. However, T cell-mediated immune responses to alloantigens, allogeneic tumors, certain syngeneic tumors, and humoral responses to xenogeneic red blood cells were normal in these mice. The immune suppression in the tumor-bearing animals closely simulated that induced by ultraviolet light irradiation, and both types of suppression might therefore share common mechanisms. Our findings may contribute to understanding the growth, development, and possible control of multicentric malignancies and add a precaution to the potential use of strongly immunogenic tumor variants for active immunotherapy in hosts bearing less immunogenic tumors.
3 Involvement of the lamin rod domain in heterotypic lamin interactions important for nuclear organization. The nuclear lamina is a meshwork of intermediate-type filament proteins (lamins) that lines the inner nuclear membrane. The lamina is proposed to be an important determinant of nuclear structure, but there has been little direct testing of this idea. To investigate lamina functions, we have characterized a novel lamin B1 mutant lacking the middle approximately 4/5 of its alpha-helical rod domain. Though retaining only 10 heptads of the rod, this mutant assembles into intermediate filament-like structures in vitro. When expressed in cultured cells, it concentrates in patches at the nuclear envelope. Concurrently, endogenous lamins shift from a uniform to a patchy distribution and lose their complete colocalization, and nuclei become highly lobulated. In vitro binding studies suggest that the internal rod region is important for heterotypic associations of lamin B1, which in turn are required for proper organization of the lamina. Accompanying the changes in lamina structure induced by expression of the mutant, nuclear pore complexes and integral membrane proteins of the inner membrane cluster, principally at the patches of endogenous lamins. Considered together, these data indicate that lamins play a major role in organizing other proteins in the nuclear envelope and in determining nuclear shape.
3 Intraepithelial lymphocytes. Anatomical site, not T cell receptor form, dictates phenotype and function. The function and structure of the TCR proteins of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were examined using a panel of mAbs specific for TCR-gamma/delta. Three subsets of TCR-gamma/delta+ IEL could be detected with five mAbs, termed GL1-GL5. The mAbs were able to trigger lysis via crosslinking of the IEL TCR and all of the subsets were constitutively cytolytic. Immunoprecipitation of IEL TCR proteins revealed that the GL2 mAb reacted only with gamma, delta heterodimers containing high Mr delta chains, while the other mAbs precipitated all of the observed gamma and delta proteins. Two-color fluorescence analysis showed that the GL2+ subset was contained within the larger GL1+ subset. The GL3 and GL4 mAbs appear to be specific for all TCR-gamma/delta while GL2 was V delta 4 specific. Analysis of IEL for TCR-alpha/beta expression demonstrated that approximately 20% of B6 IEL were TCR-alpha/beta+. Interestingly, this population of IEL contained Thy-1- and CT1+ cells, indicating that the unique phenotype of IEL was not restricted to TCR-gamma/delta+ cells. Moreover, the TCR-alpha/beta+ IEL were also constitutively cytolytic, suggesting that the intestinal milieu was controlling the functional programming of IEL regardless of TCR type. The mAbs reported here as well as the ability to exploit the distinct phenotype of IEL should prove useful in determining the function of IEL and the TCR-gamma/delta.
2 Induction of rheumatoid antibodies in the mouse. Regulated production of autoantibody in the secondary humoral response. A/J mice were found to produce autoreactive IgM anti-IgG1 in response to secondary immunization with a number of protein antigens. No anti-IgG1 was produced after a single such immunization, indicating that antigen: IgG1 antibody complexes were responsible for inducing the autoreactive response. The size of the anti-IgG1 response was in some cases massive and of the same order of magnitude as the response to the foreign immunizing material. No significant anti-IgG2a, anti-IgG2b, or anti-IgG3 response was found in mice producing anti-IgG1. Virtually all of the anti-IgG1 material produced was of the IgM class and bound to the Fc region of autologous IgG1. A component of the anti-IgG1 was shown to be able to distinguish between the two mouse IgG1 allotypes. These results suggest that self-reactive anti-IgG is a common component of the secondary immune response of mice that may have powerful physiological and immunoregulatory effects.
3 Nondissociating cationic immune complexes can deposit in glomerular basement membrane. The mechanisms by which immune complexes deposit in the glomerular basement membrane have been the subject of much debate, with the relative importance of direct deposition of circulating immune complexes (IC) vs. formation of IC in situ from the binding of circulating antibody to structural or exogenous planted antigen being at issue. In order to determine whether intact IC can deposit as such, covalently linked IC were prepared by a two-step reaction involving the bifunctional reagent toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI), the antigen bovine gamma globulin (BGG), and rabbit anti-BGG antibody. Antigen and antibody were covalently cross-linked, with little self-linkage of antigen or antibody, and IC were purified by gel filtration. The net charge of the complexes was varied by chemical means, either before or after IC formation. When cationic IC were injected intravenously into mice, there was codeposition of antigen and antibody diffusely in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and deposits were observed ultrastructurally in the laminae rarae, interna and externa, and the lamina densa. Thus, under conditions of restricted appropriate charge, intact IC can cross the glomerular basement membrane and deposit in subepithelial sites without being excluded by size alone.
3 Interleukin 1 of the central nervous system is produced by ameboid microglia. By screening specific populations of rat brain cells, we found that ameboid microglia secrete an 18 kD peptide with IL-1 biological activity. The IL-1 activity released by microglia was found to be identical to rat macrophage IL-1 on fractionation by gel filtration and high pressure liquid anion-exchange chromatography, and it was neutralized by an antiserum specific for murine IL-1. When added to astroglia grown in culture, microglial IL-1 increased the cell number of five- to sevenfold, and increased astroglial incorporation of [3H]thymidine by three- to fivefold. We propose that the proliferation of astroglia in specific brain regions may be regulated by the signaled release of IL-1 from activated microglial cells.
0 The E mu-myc transgenic mouse. A model for high-incidence spontaneous lymphoma and leukemia of early B cells. Mice transgenic for a c-myc gene driven by the IgH enhancer (E mu-myc) were shown to almost invariably develop lymphomas, 90% succumbing in the first 5 mo of life. The tumors typically presented as rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy with thymic involvement and were highly malignant by transplantation assay. Morphologically, they were lymphoblastic lymphomas, usually accompanied by lymphoid leukemia and granulocytosis, and were distinct from the tumors that arose much later in 37% of nontransgenic mice of the same (C57BL/6 x SJL)F2 genetic background. Cell-surface markers on 31 E mu-myc tumors identified 52% as pre-B lymphomas, 29% as mixed pre-B and B lymphomas, and 19% as B lymphomas. The tumors appeared to arise at random from a population of pre-B cells expanded by constitutive expression of the myc transgene. A majority of the animals initiated malignancy at the rate of 17% per week. The rate at which the cycling, benign pre-B cells spontaneously convert to malignancy was estimated to about 10(-10) per cell per generation. A transient leukocytosis identified in young E mu-myc mice was developed into a rapid assay for inheritance of the transgene.
0 Detection of human papilloma virus in paraffin-embedded tissue using the polymerase chain reaction. Human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA sequences have been detected in paraffin-embedded tissue using an enzymatic in vitro amplification technique known as the polymerase chain reaction. Amplification of a HPV DNA sequence before its detection with a cDNA probe significantly increases the rapidity as well as the sensitivity of detection such that a single 5-10-micron thick paraffin-embedded tissue section can be analyzed within 24 h. The assay specifically detected HPV 16 or 18 without crossreactivity with HPV 6 or 11. As few as 20 viral copies could be detected. The rapid and sensitive analysis of HPV in normal and pathological tissues using this technique may contribute significantly to identifying the role of HPV as a risk factor in carcinoma.
1 Dual origin of mouse spleen macrophages. The present study concerns the isolation, characterization, origin, and kinetics of spleen macrophages. The spleen was first perfused in situ to remove monocytes from the vascular bed and then dissected and treated with collagenase. The macrophages in the cell suspension thus obtained were characterized morphologically and cytochemically and then quantitated. The spleen cell suspension was incubated for 24 h in Leighton tubes to obtain an enriched glass-adherent population of macrophages for characterization and [3H]thymidine-labeling studies. Almost all of the adhering macrophages were esterase positive, had Fc and C3b receptors, and ingested EIgG and opsonized bacteria. In vitro labeling with [3H]thymidine showed that approximately 5% of the mononuclear phagocytes in the spleen synthesize DNA and must be considered to be dividing cells. The course of the number of labeled monocytes and macrophages after a single injection of [3H]thymidine indicates migration of monocytes into the spleen, where they become macrophages. Calculation of the influx of monocytes into the spleen and of the local production of macrophages by DNA-synthesizing mononuclear phagocytes showed that under steady-state conditions, 55% of the population of spleen macrophages is supplied by monocyte influx and 45% by local production. This means that there is a dual origin of spleen macrophages. The mean turnover time calculated with the value for the efflux of spleen macrophages is 6.0 d.
0 Streptococcal M protein size mutants occur at high frequency within a single strain. Streptococcal M protein, the antiphagocytic molecule on the surface of the organism, was previously found to exhibit extensive size heterogeneity between as well as within M serotypes. In this study, methods were devised to isolate M protein size mutants within a laboratory-grown culture. We were able to isolate three independent M protein deletion mutants and one additional mutant, which was derived from the first deletion mutant. We found that these deletion mutants occur at a frequency of approximately 1 in 2 X 10(3) CFUs in culture. Functional studies revealed that the deletion mutants were able to survive as well as the parental strain in human blood. They also had the determinants necessary to absorb opsonic antibodies as well as the parent. Pepsin digestion experiments localized the deletions within the N-terminal half of the M molecule, which is distal to the cell wall surface. This is the region of the molecule in which extensive sequence repeats are found. This is consistent with the suggestion that the size changes may be the result of homologous recombination between the repeat regions in the gene. These results support the idea that strains showing M protein size variation within successive clinical isolates from single patients may be derived from the initial infecting organisms, and are not the result of separate unrelated acquisitions of the same serotype. This size change may be important in the survival of the streptococcus in vivo.
3 Clonal diversity in the B cell repertoire of patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Ig protein and mRNA expression was examined in a collection of 18 monoclonal EBV-transformed B cell lines derived from five patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). A diversity of H and L chain isotypes were synthesized by these lines: the majority (12 lines) expressed mu kappa chains, while mu lambda (two lines), gamma kappa (one), gamma lambda (one), delta lambda (one), and alpha kappa (one) isotype expression was also observed. For all the mu kappa-producing XLA B cell lines, the mu and kappa mRNA transcripts were of native size, and sequence analysis across the regions of VHDJH and V kappa J kappa gene joining showed that Ig gene rearrangements occurred in a typical manner. A variety of VHDJH and V kappa J kappa gene rearrangements were observed, not only within the set of mu kappa+ XLA B cells as a whole, but also among the cell lines derived from single patients. Southern blot analysis for genomic Ig H chain gene rearrangements was done to fully assess the extent of clonal heterogeneity among multiple mu kappa+ XLA B cell lines derived from two patients; all the B cell lines possessed distinct gene rearrangement patterns demonstrating their clonal unrelatedness. Our findings indicate that the B cell repertoire in individual XLA patients is clonally diverse and that it is unlikely that the defect in B cell differentiation in XLA is the result of inefficient or ineffective rearrangement of Ig H or L chain genes. Rather, this study provides support for the idea that the XLA defect relates to a more generalized cellular function, such as regulating the proliferation and/or clonal expansion of cells of the B lymphoid lineage.
3 Endogenous oncornaviral gene expression in adult and fetal mice: quantitative, histologic, and physiologic studies of the major viral glycorprotein, gp70. Endogenous expression of the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) genome has been studied in a number of strains of mice. Expression of the major envelope glycoprotein, gp70, is restricted to certain anatomical sites and cell types, prominent among which are lymphoid and epithelial cells. On a quantitative basis, the major site of gp70 expression is the male genital tract. During development, gp70 first appears in the hematopoietic liver of 14-day-old embryos and by day 18, it is already expressed at anatomical sites similar to those of the adult. In toto, these results show that control of expression of the MuLV genome in adult and developing mice is linked to differentiation.
3 Acquisition of mitogenic responsiveness by nonresponding lymphocytes upon insertion of appropriate membrane components. The effect of insertion of plasma membrane components from lymphocytes responding to mitogens into the membranes of nonresponding cells using Sendai virus envelopes as vehicles was examined. T cells modified by B membranes were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to proliferate as well as to produce interleukin-2 activity. B cells modified by T membranes were stimulated by concanavalin A to proliferate and to produce interleukin-2 activity. B cells derived from C3H/HeJ LPS-nonresponder strain of mice, when modified by B membranes derived from the LPS-responder C3H/eb strain, acquired LPS responsiveness. These findings indicate that the inability of either T or B cells to respond to specific mitogens is due to the lack of suitable plasma membrane constituents and that by changing the membrane composition the lymphocytes can be endowed with new functions.
3 Specificity of fc receptors for IgG2a, IgG1/IgG2b, and IgE on rat macrophages. To characterize the Fc receptors on rat alveolar and peritoneal macrophages (M phi), we analyzed their ability to form rosettes with fixed ox erythrocytes (Eo') coated with myeloma proteins of all rat Ig classes and with fresh erythrocytes (Eo) sensitized with rat IgG1 and IgG2, rabbit IgG and IgM, and mouse IgA antibodies. The M phi formed rosettes with Eo' coated with rat myeloma proteins of classes IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgE but not IgG2c, IgA, IgM, and IgD. Rat M phi also formed rosettes with Eo' coated with human IgG1, IgG3, IgG4, mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and rabbit IgG. Furthermore, rat M phi formed rosettes with Eo sensitized with rat IgG1, IgG2, or rabbit IgG antibodies but not with Eo sensitized with rabbit IgM or mouse IgA antibodies. Trypsin treatment of rat M phi abolished IgG1/IgG2b and IgE but not IgG2a rosettes. The IgG2a and IgE rosettes were Ig class specific because they were inhibited only by rat IgG2a and rat IgE, respectively. In contrast, IgG1 and IgG2b rosettes were inhibited equally by IgG1 and IgG2b. Heterologous IgG inhibited IgG1/IgG2b but not IgG2a rosettes. Rat IgE inhibited rat IgG1, IgG2b, and heterologous IgG rosette formation on rat M phi. Although Eo' coated with rat IgE formed rosettes with mouse P388D1 macrophagelike cells, rat IgE did not inhibit IgG rosettes on these cells. Similarly, Eo' coated with human IgE formed rosettes with human U937 macrophage-like cells, but human IgE did not inhibit IgG rosettes on these cells. The results indicate that rat M phi have at least three distinct Fc receptors: one is specific for rat IgG2a and is trypsin resistant; a second is specific for rat IgE and is trypsin sensitive; and a third reacts with rat IgG1 rat IgG2b, and heterologous IgG and is trypsin sensitive. Rat IgE inhibited IgG1/IgG2b rosettes undirectionally and uniquely on rat M phi.
3 Sequence similarities among kappa IIIb chains of monoclonal human IgM kappa autoantibodies. Light chains of the serologically and chemically defined V region sub-subgroup kappa IIIb are preferentially associated with several types of human IgM kappa (monoclonal) autoantibodies and are remarkably homologous in primary structure, as evidenced by partial amino acid sequence data. To establish the extent of homology among such proteins, we have determined the complete variable region (V) sequence of the light chains of four monoclonal IgM kappa autoantibodies, of which two (GAR and GOT) are rheumatoid factors (RFs), the third (SON) has anti-apo beta lipoprotein specificity, and the fourth (PIE) binds specifically to intermediate filaments. The region encoded by the V kappa segment gene (positions 1-95) in all four light (L) chains is virtually identical in sequence, differing by only one residue in the FR3 of protein SON and in the first CDR of protein GOT. Further, the CDR3 of kappa chain SON contains an additional residue (prolyl) located at the carboxyl-terminus of the V segment. The region encoded by the J gene (positions 96-108) is identical after position 96 for the two RFs GAR and GOT (J kappa 2), but different in proteins SON (J kappa 4) and PIE (J kappa 1). The amino acid residue at position 96, located in CDR3 at the site of combinatoriaL joining of the V kappa and J kappa gene segments and involved as a contacting residue in the hapten binding site, is different in all four light chains. These results demonstrate the extensive homology in sequence among light chains of IgM kappa autoantibodies and indicate that a particular V kappa germ line gene, kappa IIIb, is expressed as a phylogenetic response to certain self antigens or as part of a selection process by which these autoimmune responses are regulated.
2 Cloned LYT-2+ cytolytic T lymphocytes destroy allogeneic tissue in vivo. The long-accepted notion that alloimmune cytolytic T cells (CTL) mediate transplantation immunity has recently been called into question. In order to ascertain directly whether alloimmune CTL can mediate destruction of foreign tissue, we tested the ability of mouse CTL expanded as cloned populations in vitro to destroy allogeneic skin in vivo. The results of these studies prove unequivocally that cloned Lyt-2+ CTL can perform this task in an immunologically specific, H-2-restricted, and dose-dependent fashion.
2 Molecular analysis of the influences of positive selection, tolerance induction, and antigen presentation on the T cell receptor repertoire. Immunization of both B10.A and B10.S(9R) mice with pigeon cytochrome c (pcc) elicits T cells capable of proliferating to pcc presented on I-E major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire used by pcc-specific T cells from these two strains is markedly different, even for T cells recognizing very similar antigen/MHC complexes. Our current studies have been directed toward explaining this differential expression between MHC congenic strains of TCR gene elements capable of recognizing similar ligands. Analysis of the TCR repertoire of pcc-specific T cells from F1[B10.A x B10.S (9R)]----parent radiation chimeras has demonstrated that much of this difference is a result of the positive selection of T cells for MHC restriction specificity. Further analysis of T cell lines from F1 mice and from radiation chimeras stimulated in vitro with pcc on both B10.A and B10.S(9R) antigen-presenting cells has provided clear-cut examples of the influence of positive selection, tolerance induction and of both in vivo and in vitro antigen presentation on the shaping of the TCR repertoire for a protein antigen. This is the first molecular analysis of how positive selection, tolerance induction, and antigen presentation can combine to mold the TCR repertoire.
3 Triggering T cells by otherwise inert hybrid anti-CD3/antitumor antibodies requires encounter with the specific target cell. We used a purified bispecific antibody (Ab) against CD3 and an ovarian carcinoma (OVCA) antigen to ask whether the binding of a monovalent ligand to CD3 can induce triggering of T cells. In the presence of OVCA cells, this Ab bridges the CD3 complex to the target cell and triggers proliferation and cytotoxicity in T cells. In the absence of target cells, however, this monovalent Ab, even when bound to T cells at high levels, fails to induce any increase in cytosolic Ca2+, nor does it induce responsiveness to IL-2 or modulation of the CD3 complex. Because it is inert when bound monovalently, this hybrid Ab can be used to arm in vitro CTL clones, which then retain the capacity to kill the specific tumor for up to 2 d.
